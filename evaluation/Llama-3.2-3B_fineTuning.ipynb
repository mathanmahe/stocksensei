            "Answer: PACCAR's 2022 annual report mentions an industry-wide undersupply of component parts. This is a problem because component parts are a major component of the company's revenue. The company's outlook for 2023 is therefore affected by this undersupply. The company may have to increase prices to offset the cost of the parts, which could lead to a decrease in demand. Additionally, the company may have to reduce its production capacity to meet the demand for the parts, which could lead to a decrease in revenue. Overall, the undersupply of component parts is a significant risk to the company's financial performance in 2023.\n",
