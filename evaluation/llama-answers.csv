The following table provides a reconciliation of net sales by merchandise category for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021:
Merchandise cost, including freight, is computed as a percentage of sales based on cost of goods sold. The cost of sales of merchandise sold at company-operated stores is computed using the average cost method. The average cost method is generally used in the United States and Canada. Under the average cost method, the total cost of merchandise sold for a period is divided into the total number of units of production or sales during the period and the average cost of producing or delivering such units during the period. The average cost method results in lower cost of sales per unit than the direct cost method.

The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns, often in conjunction with the introduction of new technologies that have a long product life cycle. The semiconductor industry has historically experienced rapid changes in demand that have resulted in significant fluctuations in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate manufacturing equipment and facilities, and to develop and qualify new products. As a result, the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, evolving standards, short product life cycles, price erosion and price fluctuations. These factors can dramatically affect the capital equipment requirements of a semiconductor manufacturer and can result in significant fluctuations in equipment spending from period to period. Additionally, the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing technology can render existing products obsolete.

Applied’s customers, which include manufacturers of semiconductor chips, display devices and other electronic devices, generally require high-quality products with tight tolerances and a wide range of performance characteristics. These requirements, which may differ among products, markets and customers, subject Applied’s products to a wide variety of demanding applications. Applied’s success depends on its ability to develop and produce products that meet the exacting standards of its customers while also meeting the technical requirements of these demanding applications.
Demand for Display Manufacturing Equipment
Display manufacturing is a complex process that involves the deposition of multiple layers of various materials on a display panel. These layers, which can be as thin as a few hundred angstroms, must be precisely aligned and integrated with other layers that are deposited on other substrates.

The semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns in response to, among other things, global economic downturns, changes in technology, changes in demand for end-user products, or over-supply of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. A downturn in the semiconductor industry may result in a significant reduction in the number of Applied’s customers’ devices that are manufactured annually, which could result in a significant reduction in Applied’s revenue in the future.
Applied’s results of operations are affected by economic and political conditions in the markets in which it operates.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, pricing pressure on our products. The prices that our customers are willing to pay for our products may decline for a variety of reasons, including as a result of continued industry consolidation, lower unit demand, or a decline in average selling prices for semiconductor products or other reasons. If our customers do not purchase our products or if we are unable to sell our products at prices that are acceptable to us, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.
