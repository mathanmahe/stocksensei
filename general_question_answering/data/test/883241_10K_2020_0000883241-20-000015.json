    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nCompany and Segment Overview\nSynopsys, Inc. provides products and services used across the entire Silicon to Software\u2122 spectrum to bring Smart Everything to life. From engineers creating advanced semiconductors to product teams developing advanced electronic systems to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code, our customers trust that our technologies will enable them to meet new requirements for low power as well as reliability, mobility, and security.\nWe are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. We also offer semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. These products and services are part of our Semiconductor & System Design segment.\nWe are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security, quality and compliance of software in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials. These tools and services are part of our Software Integrity segment.\nCorporate Information\nWe incorporated in 1986 in North Carolina and reincorporated in 1987 in Delaware. Our headquarters are located at 690 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View, California 94043, and our headquarters\u2019 telephone number is (650) 584-5000.

The contents of our website are not part of this Form 10-K.\nBackground\nIn this era of Smart Everything, we have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products, particularly mobile devices. The growth of the Internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create, store, and share information. At the same time, the increasing use of electronics in cars, buildings, appliances, and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of smart devices. Numerous software applications (apps) have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices. The increasing impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip and system design companies around the world.\nThese developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries. It is now common for a single chip to combine many components (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) and embedded software into a single system-on-chip (SoC), necessitating highly complex chip designs. The most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors. Transistors are the basic building blocks for ICs, each of which may have features that are less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair. At such small dimensions, the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production, proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers. Designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems, such as multiple-patterning lithography and FinFET transistors, which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production.\nThe popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and lower power consumption. Our customers, who design those products, are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative offerings in shorter timeframes and at lower prices. In other words, innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products \u201cbetter,\u201d \u201csooner,\u201d and \u201ccheaper\u201d than competitors. The designs of these chips and systems are extremely complex and necessitate state-of-the-art design solutions. Over the past several years, market verticals including AI, 5G, automotive and cloud computing infrastructure have contributed to ongoing demand for our products and services.\nA similar dynamic is at work in the software arena, whether embedded on a chip or as a standalone. The pace of innovation often requires developers to deliver more secure, high-quality software, which can include millions of lines of code, in increasingly frequent release cycles. Bugs, defects, and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix. But, at a time when software is critical in many industries across a growing array of smart devices, it is crucial to have high-quality, secure code to ensure consumers\u2019 privacy and safety.\nOur Role-As the Silicon to Software Partner\nSynopsys' Silicon to Software technologies and services are designed to help our customers-chip and system engineers and software developers-to speed time to market, achieve the highest quality of results, mitigate risk, and maximize profitability.\nChip and system designers must determine how best to design, locate, and connect the building blocks of chips, and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and cost-effectively. This is a complex, multi-step process that is both expensive and time-consuming. Our wide range of products help designers at different steps in the overall design process, from the design of individual ICs to the design of larger systems. Our products increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks, keeping track of large amounts of design data, adding intelligence to the design process, facilitating reuse of past designs, and reducing errors. Our IP products offer proven, high-quality pre-configured circuits that are ready to use in a chip design, saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products. Our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers.\nSoftware developers are responsible for writing code that not only accomplishes their goals as efficiently as possible, but also runs securely and is free of defects. We offer products that can help developers write higher quality, more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and known security vulnerabilities, adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process, and helping to eliminate defects in a systematic manner. To the extent that developers make use of open source software in their code, our products can help developers better manage the composition and security of the code. Our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle, when they are less costly to fix.\nProducts and Services\nSemiconductor & System Design Segment\nOur Semiconductor & System Design segment includes the EDA, IP and System Integration and Other revenue categories.\nEDA\nDesigning ICs involves many complex steps: architecture definition, register transfer level (RTL) design, functional/RTL verification, logic design or synthesis, gate-level verification, floorplanning, place and route, and physical verification, to name just a few. Designers use our EDA products to automate the IC design process, reduce errors, and enable more powerful and robust designs.

We launched regional emergency response teams to ensure that our employees have the appropriate equipment and support to safely and productively work remotely. In addition, in order to reinforce a deep connection and establish clear direction with our employees, we have significantly increased leadership updates and management outreach. As part of our planning, we also solicited voluntary individual profiles from our employees, enabling us to efficiently and effectively address their unique needs. Our employees have been provided with a composite of benefits and support initiatives to address the inherent challenges of working remotely during a pandemic. As the pandemic continues, the health and well-being of our workforce remains our top priority while we ensure productivity while working from home.\nEngaging the Entire Team\nWe address employee engagement through three foundational areas: recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce, soliciting and addressing employee feedback, and frequent management outreach to ensure commitment, engagement, continuous learning and skills development.\nOur workforce is representative of the industry we serve. We are highly technical, enjoy pushing the boundaries of what is possible and are individually innovative. In 2020, we grew our global team by approximately 8% with a keen focus on increasing the number of technical women in our workforce and ensuring a vibrant talent pipeline through early career hiring. We had an external hiring rate of 27% women and 29% early career hires (defined as within one year of a candidate\u2019s most recent academic degree). In this same timeframe, our undesired turnover rate has been notably low, compared to competitive benchmarks and historical trends. We attribute our strong retention to a number of factors, including exciting and challenging assignments, strong leadership and management, the opportunity to learn new skills and advance careers, the strength of our technology, customer relationships and business, along with competitive and equitable total rewards.\nTo ensure a compelling total rewards philosophy and practice, we have practices in place to deliver fair and equitable compensation for employees based on their contribution and performance. We benchmark for market practices, and regularly review our compensation against the market to ensure it remains competitive. We also offer a comprehensive and tailored set of benefits for employees and their families, providing protection from unexpected losses or medical expenses. Our benefits programs are tailored to the various geographies in which we operate.\nWe believe in continual improvement and use employee feedback to drive and improve processes that support our customers and ensure a deep understanding of our culture and vision among our employees. We conduct a confidential employee survey twice a year, and in 2020 we had record-breaking participation-90% of our employees shared their experiences and provided feedback for improvement. Results show that Synopsys employees are highly engaged, with scores generally rising in recent years. In addition, during 2020, we conducted several surveys to understand our employees\u2019 well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and to more effectively\nguide our response. Those surveys showed high approval rates of our communication and response to the pandemic. Ninety percent felt that we were helping them feel connected to one another, providing a sense of community while working remotely.\nWe also believe that ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improved individual performance. Each year, our employees participate in our Performance Development Program that summarizes key accomplishments for the preceding year, establishes new stretch goals, and identifies critical capabilities for development. We encourage managers to solicit and share supportive 360-degree feedback, further strengthening the focus on teamwork and team success.\nEmpowering Leadership\nWe regard every member of our global team as a leader. We sponsor a number of leadership programs to address the career advancement and associated business impact of our employees, emerging leaders and executives.\nOur management training is designed to increase capability in the areas of communication, engagement, coaching, inclusion and diversity, hiring and on-boarding, business skills and ensuring an ethical and supportive work environment free from bias and harassment. As employees advance in their careers, our training framework builds new capabilities on established foundational skills. Our regions and business teams also customize development programs for their specific needs.\nSynopsys sponsors continuous learning and skills development through our digital platform that is utilized by 75% of our employees as the source for internal training and insights, as well as access to external articles, videos and blogs. In addition, we host a series of in-person and on-demand learning sessions designed to build capability and adaptability required for the future.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe executive officers of Synopsys and their ages as of December 14, 2020 were as follows:\nAart J. de Geus co-founded Synopsys and has served as Chairman of our Board of Directors since February 1998 and Chief Executive Officer since January 1994.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nA description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. Investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused minor disruptions to our business operations to date and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition in the future. For example, we experienced limited hardware supply chain and logistical challenges as well as a slowdown in customer commitments in our Software Integrity segment. In response to the COVID-19 novel coronavirus pandemic, governments and businesses have taken unprecedented actions to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and restrictions on non-essential businesses. These restrictions have significantly curtailed global economic activity and have caused substantial volatility and disruption in global financial markets. We transitioned most of our employees in affected regions to work remotely in order to comply with applicable restrictions and government requirements, and implemented travel restrictions and other changes to our business operations. We are transitioning employees back into offices in select jurisdictions in conformity with local guidelines and regulations. Each office must follow physical distancing guidelines and affirmative health measures in compliance with different local and national requirements. Although we have been able to navigate workplace restrictions and limitations with minimal disruptions to our business operations to date, we may further modify our business practices and real estate needs in response to the risks and negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain that these measures will be successful.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, its overall negative impact on the global economy, continued responses by governments and businesses to COVID-19, the ability to secure timely payment from customers, the ability to accurately estimate customer demand, reduced willingness of current and potential customers to purchase our products and services due to their own business and market uncertainties, the ability of our business partners and third-party providers to fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, the ability to secure adequate and timely supply of equipment and materials from suppliers for our hardware products, and the ability to develop and deliver our products. In addition, continued weak economic conditions may result in impairment in value of our tangible and intangible assets. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIndustry Risks\nThe growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries.\nThe growth of the electronic design automation (EDA) industry as a whole, our Semiconductor & System Design segment product sales, and to some extent our Software Integrity segment product sales, are dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers, systems companies, and their customers. The increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips, integrated circuits, electronic systems and customers\u2019 concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced EDA products. Demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls, including due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, as the EDA industry has matured, consolidation has resulted in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. This increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. Many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. Our customers also frequently incorporate third-party IP, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. We work closely with major foundries to ensure that our EDA, IP, and\nmanufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. Similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor IP, particularly microprocessor IP, to optimize our EDA tools for use with their IP designs and to assure that their IP and our own IP products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. If we fail to optimize our EDA and IP solutions for use with major foundries\u2019 manufacturing processes or major IP providers\u2019 products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party IP products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nConsolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results.\nA number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. Furthermore, we depend on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue. Reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers, particularly our large customers, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. If any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, additional support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nUncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nUncertainty caused by the recent challenging global economic conditions, including due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. Such caution by customers could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts. Outside of a slowdown in customer commitments in our Software Integrity segment, we have not seen evidence of impacts on customer orders from the COVID-19 pandemic to date.\nWe cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate. Further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them to default on their obligations. There is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to the complex laws and regulations governing our industry, the banking and financial services industry, and the economy could affect our business. In addition, economic conditions could deteriorate in the future, and, in particular, the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow, including as the result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and any disruption of international trade relationships such as tariffs, export licenses, or other government trade restrictions.\nIn the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. Any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers\u2019 demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete, and our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nIn our Semiconductor & System Design segment, we compete against EDA vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation (now part of Siemens AG). We also compete with other EDA vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process. Moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products, including internal designs that compete with our IP products. In the area of IP products, we compete against numerous other IP providers as well as our customers\u2019 internally developed IP.\nIn our Software Integrity segment, we compete with numerous other solution providers, many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis. We also compete with frequent new entrants, which include start-up companies and more established software companies.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers\u2019 products, design starts and our customers\u2019 budgetary constraints. Technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements. For example, the adoption of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies can bring new demands and also challenges in terms of disruption to both business models and our existing technology offerings. Semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. At the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. In order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers\u2019 technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs.\nWe compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. Specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success:\n\u2022\nOur ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing software and hardware products, and successfully develop or acquire such new products;\n\u2022\nOur ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance;\n\u2022\nOur ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other differentiating rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, \u201cre-mix\u201d rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other Synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology;\n\u2022\nOur ability to manage an efficient supply chain to ensure availability of hardware products;\n\u2022\nOur ability to compete on the basis of payment terms; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products.\nIf we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nBusiness Operations Risks\nThe global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business.\nWe derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the United States, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the U.S. We have also continually expanded our non-U.S. operations. This strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the U.S. Our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including:\n\u2022\nIneffective or weaker legal protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nUncertain economic and political conditions in countries where we do business;\n\u2022\nGovernment trade restrictions, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers, and changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries such as China;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices in which we are prohibited from engaging by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\nFinancial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nInadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions;\n\u2022\nAdditional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries; and\n\u2022\nOther factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war, and infectious diseases and pandemics, including COVID-19.\nFurthermore, if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed.\nThere is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between certain Asian countries such as China and the United States, that political, diplomatic, or military events could result in trade disruptions, including tariffs, trade embargoes, export restrictions and other trade barriers. A significant trade disruption, export restriction, or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products and services, make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers, increase the cost of our products and services, have a negative impact on customer confidence and spending, make our products less competitive, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits, our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 businesses, and our results of operations.\nFor example, beginning in May 2019, the United States government placed certain entities on the \u201cEntity List,\u201d restricting the sale of U.S. technologies to the named entities. As a result of this government action, unless and until the restriction is lifted, we are not able to ship products or provide support to these entities. In addition, in May 2020, the United States government placed further restrictions on certain entities on the Entity List to prevent them from sharing designs developed using U.S. software or technology with other entities on the Entity List and obtaining semiconductors manufactured with processes that use U.S. software and technology. In August 2020, the Entity List rules were further revised such that any company with knowledge that a customer will use certain U.S. technologies to design or produce any item for a Huawei-affiliated company on the Entity List must obtain a license prior to any export of such technologies. We believe that this latest restriction will not materially impact our business at this time, but cannot predict the impact that additional regulatory changes may have on our business in the future. In response to these actions or similar actions taken by the United States, other countries may adopt tariffs and trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services. Current and potential customers who are concerned or affected by such tariffs or restrictions may respond by developing their own products or replacing our solutions, which would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, government or customer efforts, attitudes, laws, or policies regarding technology independence may lead to non-U.S. customers favoring their domestic technology solutions that could compete with or replace our products, which would also have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to tariffs and other trade barriers, our global operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. These laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. We may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. If we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. Any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A weakening U.S. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into U.S. dollars in our consolidated statements of operations. Likewise, a strengthening U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, including the renminbi or Yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations.\nMany factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in demand for our products-especially products, such as hardware, generating upfront revenue-due to fluctuations in demand for our customers\u2019 products and due to constraints in our customers\u2019 budgets for research and development and EDA products and services;\n\u2022\nChanges in demand for our products due to customers reducing their expenditures, whether as a cost-cutting measure or a result of their insolvency or bankruptcy, and whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other reasons;\n\u2022\nProduct competition in the EDA industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation;\n\u2022\nOur ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire;\n\u2022\nFailures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services;\n\u2022\nOur ability to implement effective cost control measures;\n\u2022\nOur dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue;\n\u2022\nChanges to the amount, composition and valuation of, and any impairments to or write-offs of, our inventory;\n\u2022\nChanges in the mix of our products sold, as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins, such as our hardware products, may reduce our overall margins;\n\u2022\nExpenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology;\n\u2022\nChanges in tax rules, as well as changes to our effective tax rate, including the tax effects of infrequent or unusual transactions and tax audit settlements;\n\u2022\nDelays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products, which includes a sole supplier for certain hardware components;\n\u2022\nNatural variability in the timing of IP drawdowns, which can be difficult to predict;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries, such as disruptions to international trade relationships, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers affecting our or our suppliers\u2019 products, as well as impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting standards, which may impact the way we recognize our revenue and costs and impact our earnings.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate. The timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include:\n\u2022\nCancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and time-based products revenue;\n\u2022\nDelay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront products revenue, such as hardware;\n\u2022\nDelay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method;\n\u2022\nDelay in the completion and delivery of IP products in development as to which customers have paid for early access;\n\u2022\nCustomer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; and\n\u2022\nThe levels of our hardware and IP revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements.\nThese factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. Additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them.\nCybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation, particularly that of our security testing solutions.\nWe store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and shelter-in-place orders, most of our employees in affected areas are working remotely, which magnifies the importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures.\nFor example, we discovered unauthorized third-party access to our products and product license files hosted on our SolvNet customer license and product delivery system in 2015. While we identified and remediated the incident, it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future, and any such breach could harm our business and reputation. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. While our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, as well as other safeguards, a breach may still occur. Any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor\u2019s systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur software products, including our hosted solutions as well as our software security and quality testing solutions, may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks. An attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software, cause errors in the output of our customers\u2019 work, allow unauthorized access to our or our customers\u2019 proprietary information, or cause other destructive outcomes. As a result, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our products, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nWe offer software security and quality testing solutions. If we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attacks, or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors, our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers\u2019 software code.\nAn actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services, and could result in a loss of customers or sales, or an increased cost to remedy a problem. Furthermore, our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a security-focused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure. Successful attacks could damage our reputation as a security-focused company.\nIf we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed.\nOur success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. Our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. We rely on agreements with customers, employees and other third-parties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue if their efforts are successful. Some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. Our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors.\nFrom time to time, we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to:\n\u2022\nAssert claims of infringement of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nDefend our products from piracy;\n\u2022\nProtect our trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u2022\nDetermine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others.\nIf we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. In addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\nAcquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our growth strategy. We have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. We expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition or investment targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions or investments due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, or other risks, which could harm our operating results. Acquisitions and strategic investments are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nPotential negative impact on our earnings per share;\n\u2022\nFailure of acquired products to achieve projected sales;\n\u2022\nProblems in integrating the acquired products with our products;\n\u2022\nDifficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions;\n\u2022\nPotential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in retaining and integrating key employees;\n\u2022\nSubstantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nFailure to realize expected synergies or cost savings;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including information technology and human resources systems;\n\u2022\nDilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in negotiating, governing and realizing value from strategic investments;\n\u2022\nAssumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources;\n\u2022\nDisruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management\u2019s attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process;\n\u2022\nPotential negative impacts on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners;\n\u2022\nExposure to new operational risks, regulations, and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business;\n\u2022\nThe need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have lacked such controls, processes and policies;\n\u2022\nNegative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition or investment-related costs; and\n\u2022\nRequirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business.\nIf we do not manage the foregoing risks, the acquisitions or strategic investments that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nAs part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts. If we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, from time to time, we invest in expansion into adjacent markets, including software security and quality testing solutions. Although we believe these solutions are complementary to our EDA tools, we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services, and our efforts in this area may not be successful. Our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract a new customer base, including in industries in which we have less experience;\n\u2022\nOur successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements;\n\u2022\nOur ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields, including, in the case of our software quality testing and security tools and services, identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages;\n\u2022\nOur ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new industries, many of which may have more financial resources, industry experience, brand recognition, relevant intellectual property rights, or established customer relationships than we currently do, and could include free and open source solutions that provide similar software quality testing and security tools without fees;\n\u2022\nOur ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacent markets with investment in our existing products and services;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields;\n\u2022\nOur ability to sell and support consulting services at profitable margins; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to manage our revenue model in connection with hybrid sales of licensed products and consulting services.\nDifficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets, including delays or disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe devote substantial resources to research and development. New competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. Finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue.\nProduct errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share.\nSoftware products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released, or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. Product errors, including those resulting from third-party suppliers, could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. In addition, any allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our IP products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers\u2019 willingness to license IP products from us. Any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur hardware products, which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems, subject us to distinct risks.\nThe growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nIncreased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components, which may reduce our control over product quality and pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products, should our supplier fail to deliver sufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\nIncreasingly variable revenue and less predictable revenue forecasts, due to fluctuations in hardware revenue, which is recognized upfront upon shipment, as opposed to most sales of software products for which revenue is recognized over time;\n\u2022\nPotential reductions in overall margins, as the gross margin for our hardware products is typically lower than those of our software products;\n\u2022\nLonger sales cycles, which create risks of insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation, which can adversely affect our operating results;\n\u2022\nDecreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of next-generation releases, which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products;\n\u2022\nLonger warranty periods than those of our software products, which may require us to replace hardware components under warranty, thus increasing our costs; and\n\u2022\nPotential impacts on our supply chain due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLiquidity requirements in our U.S. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition.\nAs of October 31, 2020, approximately 52% of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries. We intend to meet our U.S. cash spending needs primarily through our existing U.S. cash balances, ongoing U.S. cash flows, and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. Should our cash spending needs in the U.S. rise and exceed these liquidity sources, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure or the market price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. Under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results.\nWe license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. We also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. These licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. Third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. If we are unable to obtain licenses to these third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers\u2019 use of the products may be interrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers, and our reputation.\nThe inclusion of third-party intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims. Although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually, we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability. Regardless of outcome, infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management\u2019s attention.\nSome of our products and technology, including those we acquire, may include software licensed under open source licenses. Some open source licenses could require us, under certain circumstances, to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software. Although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software, the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may, if not properly addressed, result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business.\nIf we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. If we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. To be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join us in connection with acquisitions. There are a limited number of qualified EDA and IC design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. Our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. Any failure to recruit and retain key technical,\nsales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and our recruiting and retention efforts may be negatively impacted by restrictions on travel and business activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses.\nWe issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation. We face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. If we are unable to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nIn preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results.\nWe make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. We also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. These assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. In addition, we cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations. The uncertainty affects management\u2019s estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance.\nThe FASB periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics, including, for example, revenue recognition and accounting for leases. These and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results. For example, the new revenue recognition standard became applicable to us at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and there is an increased volatility in our total revenue with less predictability than the prior accounting standard.\nOur results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations, changes in our geographical earnings mix, unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns, material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates, future changes to our tax structure, or by evolving enforcement practices.\nOur operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. Because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates, an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or limitations on our ability to utilize tax credits, could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows. For example, in response to the fiscal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the State of California enacted legislation on June 29, 2020 that would suspend the use of certain corporate research and development tax credits for a three-year period beginning in our fiscal 2021, which could result in an impact in our tax expense.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), which significantly changed prior U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. The Tax Act includes certain new provisions that began to affect our income from foreign operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations that\ncould have a material impact on our ability to claim certain tax benefits related to the Tax Act. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact on our estimated annual tax rate, certain of these regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change. As additional regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may materially differ from previous estimates, and those differences may materially affect our financial position. Accounting for certain of these provisions requires the exercise of significant judgment.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the Programme of Work to Develop a Concensus Solution to the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalization of the Economy (Programme of Work) agreement by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries, including the United States. The Programme of Work is evaluating potential changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, if enacted, by various countries in which we do business may increase our taxes in these countries. Changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the Tax Act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years.\nOur income and non-income tax filings are subject to review or audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire, including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations, if any, under the Tax Act. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. An assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made.\nIn July 2017, the Hungarian Tax Authority (HTA) issued a final assessment against our Hungarian subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. The HTA has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. We paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. On April 30, 2019, the Hungarian Administrative Court ruled against Synopsys Hungary. We filed an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court on July 5, 2019. The Hungarian Supreme Court heard our appeal on November 12, 2020 and issued a ruling from the bench to remand the case to the Hungarian Administrative Court for further proceedings. We expect to receive the Hungarian Supreme Court\u2019s written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. For further discussion of the Hungary audit, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits. Our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits, how such credits are treated under provisions of the Tax Act. Changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results.\nWe may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, customer, supplier, competition, and other issues on a global basis. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. Further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\nOur business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market, and the FASB. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. For example, our efforts to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other regulations, including \u201cconflict minerals\u201d regulations\naffecting our hardware products, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs.\nRegardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. Failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets.\nFrom time to time, our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio consists of investment-grade U.S. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal securities and other securities, and bank deposits. Our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk and may be negatively impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. As a result of capital pressures on certain banks, especially in Europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired.\nOur future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. In addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer\u2019s credit quality or changes in interest rates.\nGeneral Risks\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results.\nDue to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. We rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. A disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic or pandemic (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers\u2019 orders. In particular, our sales and infrastructure are vulnerable to regional or worldwide health conditions, including the effects of the outbreak of contagious diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in California, near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected.",

    "item_2": "Item 2. Properties\nOur principal offices are located in two adjacent buildings in Mountain View, California, which together provide approximately 341,000 square feet of available space. This space is leased through August 2030, and we have two options to extend the lease term, the first to extend the term by ten years, followed by a second option to extend by approximately nine additional years. We also lease approximately 350,000 square feet of space in three adjacent buildings in Sunnyvale, California, which we have leased through October 2031. These buildings in Mountain View and Sunnyvale are used for research and development, sales and support, marketing, and administrative activities for both of our business segments.\nAdditionally, we own one building in Sunnyvale, California with approximately 120,000 square feet of space that was vacated in February 2020 and is currently leased to a third party under a lease agreement that runs through February 2031.\nWe currently lease 29 other offices throughout the United States, and own two office buildings in Oregon, one of which is leased to a third party. These offices are used primarily for sales and support activities as well as research and development for both of our business segments.\nInternational Facilities\nWe lease additional space for sales, service, and research and development activities for both of our business segments in approximately 29 countries throughout the world, including 25,000 square feet in Dublin, Ireland for our international headquarters, as well as significant sites in Yerevan, Armenia, Bangalore, India, Shanghai and Wuhan, China. We own several buildings in Wuhan, China with approximately 551,000 square feet of combined space. In addition, we own two buildings in Hsinchu, Taiwan with approximately 212,000 square feet of combined space. Beginning on March 2021, we will lease approximately 181,000 square feet of space in Shanghai with a term of ten years, and plan to vacate our existing lease in Shanghai, China.\nWe believe that our existing facilities, including both owned and leased properties, are in good condition and suitable for the current conduct of our business.",
    "item_3": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Synopsys because of the defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nWe regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and as circumstances change, it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase, decrease, or be eliminated.\nIn July 2017, the HTA issued a final assessment against Synopsys' Hungarian subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. The HTA disallowed Synopsys Hungary's tax positions taken during these years regarding the timing of the deduction of research expenses and applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $44.5 million and interest and penalties of $18.0 million. On August 2, 2017, Synopsys Hungary filed a claim contesting the final assessment with the Hungarian Administrative Court (the Court). On November 16, 2017, Synopsys Hungary paid the assessment as required by law, while continuing its challenge to the assessment in court. Hearings were held in February and July 2018, February 26, 2019 and April 30, 2019. On December 10, 2018, Synopsys withdrew its claim contesting the final assessment with regard to the timing of the deduction of research expenses, resulting in a remaining disputed tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. On April 30, 2019, the Court ruled against Synopsys Hungary. The Court's opinion was received on May 16, 2019. Synopsys Hungary filed an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court on July 5, 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of the Court's decision, we recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of $17.4 million, which is net of estimated U.S. foreign tax credits for the tax assessments. The Hungarian Supreme Court heard our appeal on November 12, 2020 and issued a ruling from the bench to remand the case to the Hungarian\nAdministrative Court for further proceedings. We expect to receive the Hungarian Supreme Court\u2019s written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nFor further discussion of the Hungary audit, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading \"Non-U.S. Examinations.\"",

Our Board replenished the stock repurchase program up to $500.0 million on June 19, 2020. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be suspended or terminated at any time by our Chief Financial Officer or our Board. We repurchase shares to offset dilution caused by ongoing stock issuances from existing equity plans for equity compensation awards and issuances related to acquisitions, and when management believes it is a good use of cash. Repurchases are transacted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and may be made through any means including, but not limited to, open market purchases, plans executed under Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act and structured transactions. As of October 31, 2020, $457.9 million remained available for future repurchases under the program.\nIn December 2019, we entered an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the December 2019 ASR) to repurchase an aggregate of $100.0 million of our common stock. Pursuant to the December 2019 ASR, we made a prepayment of $100.0 million to receive initial share deliveries of shares valued at $80.0 million.

Fiscal 2018 additionally includes a $57.8 million net benefit from tax reform and tax restructuring. Fiscal 2017 additionally includes a $166.2 million expense from our repatriation of foreign earnings. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",
    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe following overview of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7, the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.\nBusiness Summary\nSynopsys, Inc. provides products and services used across the entire Silicon to Software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to product teams developing advanced electronic systems to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. We also offer semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers\ndevelop advanced chips and electronic systems. These products and services are part of our Semiconductor & System Design segment.\nWe are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security, quality and compliance of software in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials. These tools and services are part of our Software Integrity segment.\nOur EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers\u2019 development process, our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets, and our customers' spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs.\nOur Software Integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code - while it is being written - for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance. Our Software Integrity customers are software developers across many industries, including, but also well beyond, the semiconductor and systems industries. Our Software Integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.\nWe have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty. We achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, and because we recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on our revenue recognition policy. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.\nOur growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, driving growth in the software security and quality market, and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market. In addition, due to our adoption of Accounting Standard Codification 606 (ASC 606), \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\", in the beginning of fiscal 2019, the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements has increased the variability in our total revenue from period to period. Nevertheless, the accounting impact has not affected the cash generated from our business. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the physical working environment of the substantial majority of our workforce to working from home, it has otherwise caused only minor disruptions to our business operations with a limited impact on our operating results thus far. Given the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on the global economy, our historical results may not be an indication of future performance.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, its overall negative impact on the global economy generally and the semiconductor and electronics industries specifically, and continued responses by governments and businesses to COVID-19. We have not identified trends that we expect will materially impact our future operating results at this time. As we recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, any potential impact related to COVID-19 may be delayed. We have not observed any changes in the design activity of customers, but we experienced a slowdown in customer commitments in our Software Integrity segment. We have not received any significant requests from our customers to either delay payments or modify arrangements due to COVID-19. However, this situation could change in future periods and the extent that these requests may impact our business is uncertain. We have also experienced minor disruptions in our hardware supply chain, which we have been able to address with minimal impact to our business operations to date.\nWe will continue to consider the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations. Although no material impairment or other effects have been identified to date related to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. That uncertainty affects\nmanagement\u2019s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions as additional events and information become known.\nSee Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition.\nBusiness Segments\nSemiconductor & System Design. This segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services, and semiconductor IP portfolio, which encompasses products and services that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. EDA includes digital, custom and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) IC design software, verification products, and manufacturing software products. Designers use these products to automate the highly complex IC design process and to reduce defects that could lead to expensive design or manufacturing re-spins or suboptimal end products. For IP, we are a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven IP solutions for system-on-chips (SoCs). This includes IP that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, internet of things, and cloud computing markets, enabling designers to quickly develop SoCs in these areas.\nSoftware Integrity. This segment includes a broad portfolio of products and services such as leading quality testing technologies, automated analysis, and consulting experts. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we launched the Polaris Software Integrity Platform\u2122, an integrated cloud-based solution that unites key elements to provide an even more valuable way for developers to better develop personalized approaches for open source license compliance and detect and remediate known security vulnerabilities and quality defects early in the development process, thereby minimizing risk and maximizing productivity.\nFiscal Year End\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and ended on November 3, 2018. Fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 52-week years ending on October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, respectively. Fiscal 2021 will be a 52-week year.\nFor presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.\nFiscal 2020 Financial Performance Summary\nIn fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, our financial performance reflects the following:\n\u2022\nRevenues were $3.7 billion, an increase of $324.6 million or 10%, primarily due to our continued organic growth;\n\u2022\nTotal cost of revenue and operating expenses were $3.1 billion, an increase of $224.8 million or 8%, primarily due to increases in employee-related costs of $193.4 million, resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs of $11.1 million;\n\u2022\nOperating income of $620.1 million, an increase of $99.9 million or 19%.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our significant accounting policies.\nThe accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:\n\u2022\nRevenue recognition;\n\u2022\nValuation of business combinations; and\n\u2022\nIncome taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. We have concluded that our EDA software licenses in Time-based Subscription License (TSL) contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation. Where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our obligation to customers which is to provide an ongoing right to use the most up to date and relevant software. As EDA customers operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment, satisfying the obligation requires providing critical updates to the existing software products, including ongoing iterative interaction with customers to make the software relevant to the customers\u2019 ability to meet the time to go to market with advanced products.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfuture expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;\n\u2022\nhistorical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\n\u2022\nthe expected use of the acquired assets; and\n\u2022\ndiscount rates.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nWe adopted new revenue guidance, ASC 606, at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense. The comparative information for periods prior to fiscal 2019 has not been restated.\nRevenue\nOur revenues are generated from two business segments: the Semiconductor & System Design segment and the Software Integrity segment. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions.\nFurther disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows:\nSemiconductor & System Design Segment\nThis segment is comprised of the following:\n\u2022\nEDA software includes digital, custom and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) IC design software, verification products and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. EDA products and services are typically sold through TSL arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement and software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. The weighted-average term of the TSLs we entered into in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were approximately three years, respectively. Under ASC 606, we have concluded that the software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses represent inputs to a single, combined offering, and timely, relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under TSL contracts ratably over the term of the license.\n\u2022\nIP & System Integration includes our DesignWare\u00ae IP portfolio and system-level products and services. Under ASC 606, these arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed IP and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over time. Revenue allocated to the IP licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term. Royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our IP. Payments for IP contracts are generally received upon delivery of the IP. Revenue related to the customization of certain IP is recognized as \u201cProfessional Services.\u201d\n\u2022\nIn the case of arrangements involving the sale of Hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. The second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of shipment because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. We have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and an obligation to pay for the hardware. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term.\n\u2022\nRevenue from Professional Service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. We have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.\nSoftware Integrity Segment\n\u2022\nWe sell Software Integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses, maintenance updates and technical support. Over the term of these arrangements, the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses, which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities. The licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement.\nMost of our customer arrangements involve hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers\u2019 buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.\nTotal Revenue\nThe overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience fluctuations in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of IP product sales, consulting projects, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) drawdowns, royalties, and hardware sales. As revenue from IP products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such IP products and hardware have resulted in increased variability of our total revenue.\nThe increase in total revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to the continued organic growth of the business in time-based and upfront IP license products, and higher maintenance and service revenue.\nThe increase in total revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the continued business growth in all product categories, and higher revenue of $102.5 million recognized under new revenue standard ASC 606 compared with revenue recognized under old revenue standard ASC 605. The increase was partially offset by approximately $46.0 million of additional revenue due to one extra week in fiscal 2018.\nFor a discussion of revenue by geographic areas, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTime-Based Products Revenue\nThe increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.\nThe decrease in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the impact of lower revenue recognized under ASC 606 of $206.9 million offset by an increase in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.\nUpfront Products Revenue\nChanges in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in the extent and timing of customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.\nThe increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of IP products driven by higher demand from customers.\nThe increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of IP products driven by higher demand from customers and higher IP revenue recognized upfront under ASC 606 of $235.4 million.\nUpfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of IP products and hardware sales. Such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments due to customer requirements.\nMaintenance and Service Revenue\nMaintenance revenue for fiscal 2020 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the volume and type of arrangements that include maintenance.\nThe increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue under ASC 606 of $74.0 million and an increase in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance.\nThe increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of IP consulting projects and the timing of IP consulting projects.\nThe increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the timing of IP consulting projects. The increase was offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nOur expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnel-related costs including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and variable compensation; changes in amortization; changes in hardware related direct costs; and changes in selling and marketing expenses. The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our overall growth, and fixed charges including information technology (IT) and facilities.\nForeign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, or fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs.\nCost of Revenue\nWe divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.\nCost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, hardware related direct costs, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility.\nCost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. We expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions, but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.\nThe increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increases of $25.6 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases from organic hiring and acquisitions, $16.1\nmillion in consulting costs primarily related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, $5.1 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses, and $2.8 million in hardware related direct costs, partially offset by a decrease of $7.1 million in amortization of intangible assets.\nThe increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $21.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases from organic hiring, $11.3 million in consulting costs primarily related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, $10.1 million in IT and facility expenses, and $5.3 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $24.4 million in amortization of intangible assets and one additional week of expenses of approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2018.\nChanges in other cost of revenue categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nThe increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increases of $124.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, $14.8 million in facility expenses, and $6.6 million in consultants and contractor costs, partially offset by lower deferred compensation expenses of $4.5 million.\nThe increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of $41.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including organic hiring and those from prior year acquisitions, $22.8 million in IT and facility expenses, and $5.5 million in consultants and contractor costs, partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $19.3 million in fiscal 2018.\nChanges in other research and development expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a decrease of $19.5 million that included reduced travel and marketing expenses as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related costs of $19.1 million.\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of $11.3 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases and $4.3 million in IT and facility expenses, partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $5.8 million in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, commission expenses were $4.1 million lower compared to commission expenses for fiscal 2018 which was accounted for under ASC 605.\nChanges in other sales and marketing expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase of $24.2 million in personnel-related expenses, a legal settlement of $18.3 million in our favor in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and an increase of $13.1 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in professional service costs.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a $26.0 million litigation settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, a legal settlement of $18.3 million in our favor in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and an additional week of expenses of approximately $4.1 million in fiscal 2018. The decreases were partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in personnel-related costs.\nChanges in other general and administrative expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.\nChange in Fair Value of Deferred Compensation\nThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no impact to our net income from the fair value changes in our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, and in-process research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years. Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:\nThe decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized, partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2020.\nThe decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized, partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2019.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2019, our management approved, committed and initiated a restructuring plan (the Plan) as part of a business reorganization. Total charges under the Plan consisted primarily of severance, termination, and retirement benefits under the 2019 Voluntary Retirement Program (VRP).\nThe following is a summary of our restructuring activities:\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe net decrease in other income (expense) for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to changes in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets, partially offset by lower interest expenses due to a lower debt balance.\nThe net increase in other income (expense) in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was also primarily due to changes in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.\nSegment Operating Results\nWe do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments. These unallocated expenses consist primarily of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, litigation and acquisition-related costs. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nSemiconductor & System Design Segment\nThe increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.\nThe increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue recognized under ASC 606 of $97.5 million and an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, partially offset by approximately $12.0 million due to an additional week of operating income in fiscal 2018.\nSoftware Integrity Segment\nThe increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.\nThe increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods and the impact of higher revenue recognized under ASC 606 of $5.0 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), enacted on December 22, 2017, lowered the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018. Beginning in fiscal 2019, our annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is 21%.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was (4.0%), which included a tax benefit of $39.2 million of U.S. federal research tax credit, a foreign derived intangible income (FDII) deduction of $24.3 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $72.3 million.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 2.4%, which included a tax benefit of $28.1 million related to the realizability of U.S. foreign tax credits related to the transfer of intangibles associated with the tax restructuring in fiscal 2018, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $34.5 million, a FDII deduction of $26.6 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $40.5 million.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was (19.0%), which included a tax benefit of $172.0 million relating to the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $35.1 million, a tax benefit of $28.1 million arising from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in fiscal 2017, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $31.0 million. These benefits were partially offset by tax expense of $63.1 million for a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings, $51.1 million due to re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $27.9 million.\nThe integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among company-controlled entities. These intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a company-controlled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition.\nThe Tax Act required us to pay a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a tax expense of $63.1 million. Based on subsequent judicial rulings in fiscal 2019 (including Altera Corp. et al. v. Commissioner and the Hungarian Administrative Court ruling), we recorded a tax benefit of $17.9 million related to the one-time transition tax. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe Tax Act includes certain new tax provisions listed below which apply to us beginning in fiscal 2019.\n\u2022\nA tax on global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), which is determined annually based on our aggregate foreign subsidiaries' income in excess of certain qualified business asset investment return. In fiscal 2019, we adopted an accounting policy to account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax.\n\u2022\nA base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which functions as a minimum tax that partially disallows deductions for certain related party transactions and certain tax credits.\n\u2022\nA special tax deduction for FDII, which, in general, allows a deduction of certain intangible income earned in the U.S. and derived from foreign sources.\nThe Tax Act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.\nIn July 2017, the Hungarian Tax Authority (the HTA) issued a final assessment against our Hungarian subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. The HTA applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. We paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. On April 30, 2019, the Hungarian Administrative Court ruled against Synopsys Hungary. We filed an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court on July 5, 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of the Court's decision, we recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of $17.4 million, which is net of estimated U.S. foreign tax credits for the tax assessments. The Hungarian Supreme Court heard our appeal on November 12, 2020 and issued a ruling from the bench to remand the case to the Hungarian Administrative Court for further proceedings. We expect to receive the Hungarian Supreme Court\u2019s written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nSee Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes, the impacts related to the Tax Act, and the Hungarian audit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities.\nWe have considered the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources. Although we have not observed any material effects on our liquidity, collections from customers or other working capital requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic to date, there is substantial uncertainty that could result in greater variability as additional events and information become known. We believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, share repurchases, acquisitions, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. We are continuously evaluating the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effects and taking steps to mitigate known risks, including potential constraints on our liquidity and capital resources as a result of customers\u2019 reduced expenditures or disruptions to our supply chain. In light of that ongoing assessment, we may choose to temporarily defer certain expenditures due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of October 31, 2020, we held an aggregate of $590.0 million in cash and cash equivalents in the United States and an aggregate of $645.7 million in our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.\nThe following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow, and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2020.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to cash from our operations and net proceeds from our credit facilities. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by stock repurchases, repayment of debt, cash used for acquisition, and purchases of property and equipment.\nCash Flows\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.\nFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income, higher cash collections and lower disbursements in operations, including timing of vendor payments and other employee related expenses.\nFiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income and higher cash collections, partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendor payments.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions of $164.4 million.\nFiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2018 of $616.0 million.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower debt repayments of $235.2 million and higher proceeds of $83.6 million from credit facilities drawdowns.\nFiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Cash used in financing activities was higher primarily due to higher debt repayments of $228.8 million and lower proceeds from credit facilities drawdowns of $427.7 million.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nChanges in our accounts receivable balance are primarily driven by the timing and volume of customer billing and collection activities.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets:\nIncreases in our working capital were primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $507.1 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $226.8 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $175.8 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $117.2 million. We did not see a significant impact on our working capital during this period from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Commitments - Credit and Term Loan Facilities\nAs of October 31, 2020, we had $102.1 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan, of which $75.0 million was classified as long-term liabilities. Outstanding principal payments under the Term Loan are due as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2019, we had a $119.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan, of which $102.2 million was classified as long-term liabilities.\nThere was no outstanding balance under the Revolver as of October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2019. We expect our borrowings under the Revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur Term Loan and Revolver borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2020, borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR +1.000%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.\nIn July 2018, we entered into a 12-year 220.0 million RMB (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support our facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5 year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%. As of October 31, 2020, we had $25.8 million outstanding under the agreement.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther\nAs of October 31, 2020, our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk.\nWe proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. The majority of our investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our Revolver will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations as of October 31, 2020 are as follows:\n(1)\nSee Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(2)\nPurchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2020. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.\n(3)\nThese commitments relate to the principal of the Term Loan and a credit facility as discussed in Other Commitments above.\n(4)\nThese other obligations include fees associated with our credit facility.\n(5)\nLong-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2020. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2020 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.\nThe expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of October 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2020, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and debt were at short-term variable or fixed interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of these investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument.\nOur cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of October 31, 2020 are as follows:\nForeign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary\u2019s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months. See Note 2 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts.\nThe success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2020, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $7.6 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $7.6 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in positive cash flow of approximately $7.6 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.\nNet unrealized gain of approximately $3.4 million and net unrealized loss of $4.5 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIf estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.\nWe do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements.\nInformation about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2020 was as follows:\nEquity Risk. We had approximately $13.2 million and $11.0 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The investments that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted using the measurement alternative when the fair value of the investment is not readily determinable. Securities accounted for as equity method investments are recorded at cost plus the proportional share of the issuers\u2019 income or loss, which is recorded in the other income (expense), net. Investments are written down to the fair value when an event or circumstance which impacts the fair value of these investments indicates that the investments are impaired and the fair value of the investments is less than the carrying value. None of our investments are held for speculation purposes.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nSynopsys, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of November 3, 2019 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842),\u201d and changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and sales commissions as of November 4, 2018 due to the adoption of FASB\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606),\u201d and Subtopic 340-40, \u201cOther Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers (ASC 340-40).\u201d\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A(b). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAssessment of recognition of uncertain tax provisions\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, as of October 31, 2020 the Company recognized uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. As of October 31, 2020, the Company recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest and penalties, of $83.1 million.\nWe identified the assessment of the recognition of uncertain tax positions within the U.S. federal jurisdiction as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment, including the involvement of tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, was required to evaluate the Company\u2019s interpretation and application of U.S. federal tax law.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s accounting process for uncertain tax positions, including controls related to the interpretation of U.S. federal tax law and its application in the liability recognition process. Since U.S. federal tax law is complex and often subject to interpretation, we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\u2022\nObtaining an understanding of the Company\u2019s overall tax structure and assessing the Company\u2019s compliance with U.S. federal tax laws,\n\u2022\nEvaluating U.S. federal tax law and assessing the Company\u2019s interpretation of the tax law, and\n\u2022\nInspecting correspondence, assessments, and settlements from taxing authorities to assess the Company\u2019s determination of its tax positions having more than a 50% likelihood to be sustained upon examination.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1992.\nSanta Clara, California\nDecember 14, 2020\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except par value amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(In thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Description of Business\nSynopsys, Inc. (Synopsys or the Company) provides products and services used across the entire silicon to software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code. The Company is a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. The Company also offers semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. The Company provides software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, the Company provides technical services and support to help its customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. These products and services are part of the Company\u2019s Semiconductor & System Design segment.\nThe Company is also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security, quality and compliance of software in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials. These tools and services are part of the Company\u2019s Software Integrity segment.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nFiscal Year End. The Company\u2019s fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, the Company has a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, the Company includes the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 52-week years ending on October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, respectively. Fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and ended on November 3, 2018. For presentation purposes, the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes refer to the closest calendar month end. Fiscal 2021 will be a 52-week year.\nBasis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates. To prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and may result in material effects on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial position. In addition, the Company has considered the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business operations. Although no material impairment or other effects have been identified to date related to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. This uncertainty affects management\u2019s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions as additional events and information are known.\nForeign Currency Translation. The functional currency of the majority of the Company\u2019s active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary\u2019s local currency. Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency with any related gain or loss recorded in earnings. The Company translates assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign operations into the U.S. dollar reporting currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The Company translates income and expense items of such foreign operations into the U.S. dollar reporting currency at average exchange rates for the period. Accumulated translation adjustments are reported in stockholders\u2019 equity, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nForeign Currency Contracts. The Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company enters into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions. The assets or liabilities associated with the forward contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets or accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the foreign currency forward contract and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. See Note 6. Financial Assets and Liabilities.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nFair Values of Financial Instruments. The Company\u2019s cash equivalents and foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value. The fair value of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates the carrying amount due to their short duration. Non-marketable equity securities are accounted for using either the measurement alternative or equity method of accounting, net of impairments. The Company performs periodic impairment analysis on these non-marketable equity securities. The carrying amount of the short-term debt approximates the estimated fair value. See Note 7. Fair Value Measures.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The Company classifies investments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired as cash equivalents.\nConcentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency contracts, and accounts receivable from trade customers. The Company maintains cash equivalents primarily in highly rated taxable and tax-exempt money market funds located in the U.S. and in various overseas locations.\nThe Company sells its products worldwide primarily to customers in the global electronics market. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and does not require collateral. The Company establishes reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been within management\u2019s expectations and have not been material in any year presented.\nAccounts Receivable, Net. The balances consist of accounts receivable billed and unbilled. Unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recorded as revenue which will be invoiced within one year of the balance sheet date. The following table represents the components of accounts receivable, net:\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reduce the Company\u2019s receivables to their estimated net realizable value. The Company provides a general reserve on all accounts receivable based on a review of customer accounts. The following table presents the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts:\n(1)\nBalances written off, net of recoveries.\nInventories, net. Inventories are computed at standard costs which approximate actual costs, on a first-in, first-out basis and valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories primarily include components and parts used in emulation and prototyping hardware systems. Valuation process include a review of the stage of the product life cycle and forecasts based upon future demand and market conditions. Inventory provisions are recorded when the costs are determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or considered obsolete.\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nto taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. An uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied.\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets, excluding land, are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the lease or the economic useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Depreciation expenses were $119.1 million, $100.4 million and $72.8 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and such costs were $62.1 million, $52.5 million and $45.7 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nA summary of property and equipment, at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, as of October 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n(1)\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization includes write-offs due to retirement of fully amortized fixed assets.\nThe useful lives of depreciable assets are as follows:\nLeases. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842),\u201d which supersedes the previous lease requirements in Topic 840. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by several ASUs. The new guidance requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability for most operating leases in the consolidated balance sheets. These ASUs also made minor changes to lessor accounting and aligned key aspects of the lessor accounting model with the new revenue recognition guidance. The new standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements for arrangements in which the Company is the lessor.\nThe Company adopted Topic 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020 using the modified retrospective method without restatement of comparative periods. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allows the carryforward of historical assessments about (1) lease classification, (2)\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nwhether a contract is or contains a lease, and (3) which costs qualify as initial direct costs for leases that existed prior to the adoption. The Company did not elect either the use of hindsight or land easements practical expedients available in transition.\nThe adoption of the standard did not have an impact on the Company\u2019s beginning retained earnings, results of operations, or cash flows. The operating lease liabilities equaled the present value of the remaining Topic 840 minimum rental payments for those leases, discounted at the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate as of the date of adoption. The ROU assets were measured at the amount of the related lease liabilities plus any prepaid rental payments and less any unamortized lease incentives such as tenant improvement allowances. The Company recognized ROU assets of $475 million and operating lease liabilities of $540 million on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company determines if a contract is or contains a lease at inception. ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities for operating and finance leases are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the remaining lease terms. ROU assets are derived from the carrying amount of the related lease liability plus any prepaid lease payments, less any lease incentives such as tenant improvement allowances. The Company primarily uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined as of the lease commencement date, to measure the present value of its future lease payments, as the rate implicit in the lease is generally not readily determinable. The Company uses a benchmark senior unsecured yield curve for debt instruments and considers specific credit quality, market conditions, tenor of lease arrangements, and quality of collateral to determine the incremental borrowing rate.\nOperating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term of each lease. Variable payments, such as for maintenance, property taxes or insurance, are recognized on our consolidated statements of operations as incurred.\nThe Company has adopted both (1) the practical expedient to not separate lease from non-lease components and (2) the short-term lease exemption. The Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease from non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets and the short-term lease exemption for all classes of underlying assets except real estate leases, with terms 12 months or less.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired by the Company. The carrying amount of goodwill at each reporting unit is tested for impairment annually as of October 31, or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review.\nThe Company performs a qualitative analysis when testing a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill for impairment. A qualitative goodwill impairment test is performed when the fair value of a reporting unit historically has significantly exceeded the carrying value of its net assets and based on current operations is expected to continue to do so. Otherwise, the Company is required to conduct a quantitative impairment test for each reporting unit and estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of an income approach based on discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach based on market multiples. The discount rate used in the income approach is based on the Company's weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks pertaining to projecting future cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference. As of October 31, 2020, the Company performed a qualitative impairment test on each of the reporting units and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill.\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets consist of acquired technology, certain contract rights, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, capitalized software, and in-process research and development. These intangible assets are acquired through business combinations, direct purchases, or internally developed capitalized software. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from one to ten years, except for in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects not yet completed. IPR&D assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives upon completion or are written off upon abandonment.\nThe Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such asset group will be recovered through the undiscounted future cash flow. If the undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset group, the Company\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nrecognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group. The Company had no material impairment charges for long-lived assets in fiscal 2018 and none in fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nRestructuring Charges. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company initiated a restructuring plan for involuntary and voluntary employee termination and facility closure actions as part of a business reorganization to better position the Company for future growth by reallocating resources to priority areas, and to a lesser extent, eliminating operational redundancy. The total charges under the 2019 restructuring plan were $83.3 million and consisted primarily of severance, termination, and retirement benefits under the 2019 VRP.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company incurred restructuring charges of $36.1 million under the 2019 restructuring plan. These charges consisted primarily of severance, termination, and retirement benefits. $57.4 million was paid in fiscal 2020 which included payments of remaining balances in fiscal 2019. As of October 31, 2020, $1.3 million remained outstanding and was recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as payroll and related benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. The remaining balance will be paid in fiscal 2021.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company incurred restructuring charges of approximately $47.2 million for involuntary employee termination actions and the VRP. These charges consist primarily of severance, termination, and retirement benefits, of which $24.6 million was paid in fiscal 2019. As of October 31, 2019, $22.6 million remained outstanding and was recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as payroll and related benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. The remaining balance was paid in fiscal 2020.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company recorded $12.9 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary employee termination actions. The restructuring actions were undertaken to position the Company for future growth, reallocate resources to priority areas and, to a lesser extent, eliminate operational redundancy. These charges consisted primarily of severance benefits. As of October 31, 2018, there was an $8.1 million outstanding balance remaining in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The majority of the balance was paid in fiscal 2019 and there was no remaining balance as of the end of fiscal 2020.\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. The balance consisted of:\nOther Long-term Liabilities. The balance consisted of:\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) includes all changes in equity during a period, such as accumulated net translation adjustments, unrealized gain (loss) on certain foreign currency forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, reclassification adjustments related to cash flow hedges and unrealized gain (loss) on investments. See Note 10. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nRevenue Recognition. The Company adopted ASC 606 on November 4, 2018, the beginning of fiscal year 2019, using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information for periods prior to fiscal year 2019 has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue for the transfer of services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services or products.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe principle is achieved through the following five-step approach:\n\u2022\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligation in the contract\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nNature of Products and Services\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses and, to a lesser extent, hardware products, maintenance and services. The various types are set forth below.\nElectronic Design Automation\nSoftware license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of the Company's software primarily through Technology Subscription License (TSL) contracts. TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term and generally provide the customer with limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. The majority of the Company's arrangements are TSLs due to the nature of its business and customer requirements. In addition to the licenses, the arrangements also include: post-contract customer support, which includes providing frequent updates and upgrades to maintain the utility of the software due to rapid changes in technology; other intertwined services such as multiple copies of the tools; assisting the Company's customers in applying the Company's technology in the customers' development environment; and rights to remix licenses for other licenses. Payments are generally received in equal or near equal installments over the term of the arrangement. Under ASC 605, these arrangements were required to be recognized ratably over the contract terms. Under ASC 606, the Company has concluded that its software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from its obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term. Such updates represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation, commencing upon the later of the arrangement effective date or transfer of the software license. Remix rights are not an additional promised good or service in the contract, and where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, such rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support because such rights are provided for the same period of time and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over the duration of the subscription term.\nIP & System Integration\nThe Company generally licenses IP under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications. Additionally, for certain IP license agreements, royalties are collected as customers sell their own products that incorporate the Company\u2019s IP. Under ASC 605, the Company recognized revenue either upfront if certain criteria in ASC 605 were met, or over the contractual period for IP licensing and support arrangements if such arrangements were combined with other TSL arrangements. Under ASC 606, these arrangements generally have two distinct performance obligations that consist of transferring the licensed IP and the support service. Support services consist of a stand-ready obligation to provide technical support and software updates over the support term. Revenue allocated to the IP license is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support services is recognized ratably over the support term. Royalties are recognized as revenue is earned, generally when the customer sells its products that incorporate the Company\u2019s IP.\nSoftware Integrity Products\nSoftware Integrity product arrangements provide customers the right to software licenses, software updates and technical support. Under the term of these arrangements, the customer expects to receive integral updates to the software licenses that protect the customer\u2019s software from potential security vulnerabilities. The licenses and software updates together serve to fulfill the Company\u2019s commitment to the customer, as they represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation that commences upon the later of the arrangement effective date or transfer of the software license. Software updates are part of the contract with the customer, and such rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support because such rights are provided for the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nHardware\nThe Company generally has two performance obligations in arrangements involving the sale of hardware products. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes embedded software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. The second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, including rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at a point in time when the hardware is shipped to the customer. The Company has concluded that control generally transfers upon delivery because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and an obligation to pay for the hardware. The portion of the transaction price allocated to maintenance is recognized as revenue that is ratable over the maintenance term. The adoption of ASC 606 did not change the timing of revenue recognition for hardware products and related services.\nProfessional Services\nThe Company's arrangements often include service elements (other than maintenance and support services). These services include training, design assistance, and consulting. Services performed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided. Certain arrangements also include the customization or modification of licensed IP. Revenue from these contracts is recognized over time as the services are performed, when the development is specific to the customer\u2019s needs and Synopsys has enforceable rights to payment for performance completed. Inputs such as costs incurred and hours expended are used in order to measure progress of performance. The Company has a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances, specification and testing requirement changes, and changes in customer delivery priorities. Payments for services are generally due upon milestones in the contract or upon consumption of the hourly resources.\nFlexible Spending Accounts\nSome customers enter into a non-cancelable Flexible Spending Account arrangement (FSA) whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of Synopsys products or services. These arrangements do not meet the definition of a revenue contract until the customer executes a separate order to identify the required products and services that they are purchasing. The combination of the FSA arrangement and the subsequent order creates enforceable rights and obligations, thus meeting the definition of a revenue contract. Each separate order under the agreement is treated as an individual contract under the new standard and accounted for based on the respective performance obligations included within the FSA arrangements.\nJudgments\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together requires significant judgment. The Company has concluded that (1) its EDA software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from its obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation, and (2) where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, such rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided for the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. In reaching this conclusion, the Company considered the nature of the obligation to customers which is to provide an ongoing right to use the most up to date and relevant software. As EDA customers operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment, satisfying the obligation requires providing critical updates to the existing software products, including ongoing iterative interaction with customers to make the software relevant to customers\u2019 ability to meet the time to go to market with advanced products.\nSimilarly, the Company also concluded that in its Software Integrity business, the licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill the Company\u2019s commitment to the customer as both work together to provide the\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nfunctionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation because the updates are essential to the software\u2019s central utility, which is to identify security vulnerabilities and other threats.\nJudgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation. For non-software performance obligations (IP, Hardware, and services), SSP is established based on observable prices of products and services sold separately. SSP for license (and related updates and support) in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other non-software performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSP, using observable prices, with any residual amount of the transaction price allocated to the license because the Company does not sell the license separately, and the pricing is highly variable.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers, and these timing differences result in receivables (billed or unbilled), contract assets, or contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The Company records a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to the right to invoice, or deferred revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For time-based software agreements, customers are generally invoiced in equal, quarterly amounts, although some customers prefer to be invoiced in single or annual amounts. The Company records an unbilled receivable when revenue is recognized and it has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment.\nWarranties and Indemnities. The Company generally warrants its products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days for software products and for up to six months for hardware systems. In certain cases, the Company also provides its customers with limited indemnification with respect to claims that their use of the Company\u2019s software products infringes on United States patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets. The Company is unable to estimate the potential impact of these commitments on the future results of operations. To date, the Company has not been required to pay any material warranty claims.\nNet Income Per Share. The Company computes basic income per share by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the dilution from potential common shares outstanding such as stock options and unvested restricted stock units and awards during the period using the treasury stock method.\nThe table below reconciles the weighted average common shares used to calculate basic net income per share with the weighted average common shares used to calculate diluted net income per share:\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\n(1)\nThese stock options and unvested restricted stock units were anti-dilutive for the respective periods and are excluded in calculating diluted net income per share. While such awards were anti-dilutive for the respective periods, they could be dilutive in the future.\nNote 3. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe following table shows the percentage of revenue by product groups:\n(1)\nThe percentage of revenue by Other is less than 1%.\nContract Balances\nThe contract assets indicated below are presented as prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights to invoice and receive payment become unconditional. Unbilled receivables are presented as accounts receivable, net, in the consolidated balance sheets.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nContract balances are as follows:\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $1.1 billion of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of October 31, 2019. During fiscal 2019, the Company recognized $1.0 billion of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of October 31, 2018.\nContracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $4.9 billion as of October 31, 2020, which includes $673.8 million in non-cancellable FSA commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. The Company has elected to exclude future sales-based royalty payments from the remaining performance obligations. Approximately 61% of the contracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations as of October 31, 2020, excluding non-cancellable FSA, are expected to be recognized over the next 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $102.4 million from performance obligations satisfied from sales-based royalties earned during the periods. During fiscal 2019, the Company recognized $80.0 million from performance obligations satisfied from sales-based royalties earned during the periods.\nCosts of Obtaining a Contract with Customer\nThe Company adopted ASC Subtopic 340-40, \u201cOther Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers (ASC 340-40)\u201d on November 4, 2018, the beginning of fiscal year 2019, using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information for periods prior to fiscal year 2019 has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, which consist primarily of direct sales commissions earned upon execution of the contract, are required to be capitalized under ASC 340-40 and amortized over the estimated period of which the benefit is expected to be received. As direct sales commissions paid for renewals are commensurate with the amounts paid for initial contracts, the deferred incremental costs will be recognized over the contract term. Total capitalized direct commission costs as of October 31, 2020 were $81.3 million and are included in other assets in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of these assets was $61.2 million during fiscal 2020 and is included in sales and marketing expense in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. Total capitalized direct commission costs as of October 31, 2019 were $86.4 million and are included in other assets in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of these assets was $62.8 million during fiscal 2019 and is included in sales and marketing expense in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nNote 4. Business Combinations\nFiscal 2020 Acquisitions\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company completed several acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of $238.3 million, net of cash acquired as described below:\n\u2022\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company completed an acquisition for an aggregate consideration of $105.7 million; including cash consideration of $75.7 million and the Company\u2019s products exchanged in connection with the acquisition with a fair value of $30.0 million.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe consideration of $105.7 million was allocated to $20.6 million of identifiable intangible assets, $4.2 million of net tangible assets, and $80.9 million in goodwill, on a preliminary basis. The fair value of these intangible assets was estimated using the income method. These transactions are not considered to be material to the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. The acquisition was attributable to the Semiconductor & System Design reporting segment.\nConcurrent to this transaction, the Company also executed a design service arrangement and recognized an asset of $10.7 million for the off-market component. The $10.7 million contract asset is expected to be amortized over the contractual period of the agreement of five years.\n\u2022\nIn addition to the above, the Company also completed several other acquisitions for an aggregate cash consideration of $132.6 million, net of cash acquired. The preliminary purchase allocations are $44.7 million of identifiable intangible assets and $92.8 million in goodwill, of which $13.3 million is attributable to the Software Integrity reporting segment. The fair value of these intangible assets and goodwill are estimated using the income method.\nThe preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for all acquisitions completed within 12 months from the applicable acquisition date are not yet finalized and may change as additional information becomes available during the respective measurement periods. The primary areas of those preliminary estimates relate to certain tangible assets and liabilities, identifiable intangible assets, and income taxes.\nThe Company does not consider these acquisitions to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nNote 5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company has two reporting units and has assigned assets and liabilities to each of the reporting units based on each unit's operating activities. No impairment of goodwill was identified for any periods presented. Goodwill activity by reportable segment for the year ended October 31, 2020 consisted of the following:\nGoodwill activity by reportable segment for the year ended October 31, 2019 consisted of the following:\nIn-process research and development (IPR&D) as of October 31, 2020 consisted of acquired projects that, if completed, will be reclassified to core/developed technology upon completion, or if abandoned, will be written off. Intangible assets as of October 31, 2020 consisted of the following:\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nIntangible assets as of October 31, 2019 consisted of the following:\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets consisted of the following:\n(1)\nAmortization of capitalized software development costs is included in cost of products revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following table presents the estimated future amortization of intangible assets as of October 31, 2020:\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nNote 6. Financial Assets and Liabilities\nCash equivalents. The Company classifies time deposits and other investments with original maturities less than three months as cash equivalents.\nAs of October 31, 2020, the balances of the Company's cash equivalents and non-marketable equity securities investments were:\n(1)\nSee Note 7. Fair Value Measures for further discussion on fair values of cash equivalents.\nAs of October 31, 2019, the balances of our cash equivalents and non-marketable equity securities investments were:\n(1)\nSee Note 7. Fair Value Measures for further discussion on fair values of cash equivalents.\nRestricted cash. The Company includes amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows. All restricted cash is primarily associated with office leases and has no material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated balance sheets:\nNon-marketable equity securities. The Company\u2019s strategic investment portfolio consists of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies. The investments that the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted using the measurement alternative when the fair value of the investment is not readily determinable. Securities accounted for as equity method investments are recorded at cost plus the proportional share of the issuers\u2019 income or loss, which is recorded in the Company\u2019s other income (expense), net. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. See Note 7. Fair Value Measures.\nDerivatives.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities, which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements of ASC 815. Pursuant to the provisions of ASU 2017-12, the Company is not required to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, which was previously recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Also, prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, the forward point components of the cash flow hedges were excluded from assessing effectiveness of the hedging relationship and were recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense), net. Following the Company's adoption of ASU 2017-12, the Company presents the related earning impact of the cash flow hedges in the same income statement section as the hedged items. Adoption of the guidance did not impact opening retained earnings or have a material impact on our financial statements.\nThe Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and provides qualitative and quantitative disclosures about such derivatives. The Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company enters into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe duration of forward contracts ranges from approximately one month to 22 months, the majority of which are short-term. The Company does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts with high credit quality financial institutions that are rated \u2018A\u2019 or above and to date has not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. In addition, the Company mitigates credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty and anticipates continued performance by all counterparties to such agreements.\nThe assets or liabilities associated with the forward contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets or accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the foreign currency forward contract and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. The cash flow impact upon settlement of the derivative contracts will be included in \u201cNet cash provided by operating activities\u201d in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nCash Flow Hedging Activities\nCertain foreign exchange forward contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. These contracts have durations of approximately 22 months or less. Certain forward contracts are rolled over periodically to capture the full length of exposure to the Company\u2019s foreign currency risk, which can be up to three years. To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on the hedged transactions. The related gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI), in stockholders\u2019 equity and reclassified into revenue or operating expenses, as appropriate, at the time the hedged transactions affect earnings. The Company expects a majority of the hedge balance in OCI to be reclassified to the statements of operations within the next twelve months.\nPrior to adoption of ASU 2017-12, hedge effectiveness was evaluated monthly using spot rates, with any gain or loss caused by hedging ineffectiveness recorded in other income (expense), net. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, the amounts recognized in other income (expense) for ineffectiveness and excluded component were immaterial.\nUpon adoption of ASU 2017-12, the Company elected to use the forward method to measure hedge effectiveness for its Japanese yen revenue and foreign currency expense cash flow hedges. The Company did not change the process for its backlog cash flow hedges and continues to measure hedging effectiveness on a monthly basis.\nNon-designated Hedging Activities\nThe Company\u2019s foreign exchange forward contracts that are used to hedge non-functional currency denominated balance sheet assets and liabilities are not designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, any gains or losses from changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded in other income (expense), net. The gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses associated with the underlying assets and liabilities, which are also recorded in other income (expense), net. The duration of the forward contracts for hedging the Company\u2019s balance sheet exposure is approximately one month.\nThe Company also has certain foreign exchange forward contracts for hedging certain international revenues and expenses that are not designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, any gains or losses from changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded in other income (expense), net. The gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses associated with the foreign currency in operating income. The duration of these forward contracts is usually less than one year. The overall goal of the Company\u2019s hedging program is to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on its net income over its fiscal year.\nThe effects of non-designated derivative instruments on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 are summarized as follows:\nThe notional amounts in the table below for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding:\nThe notional amounts for derivative instruments do not represent the amount of the Company\u2019s exposure to market gain or loss. The Company\u2019s exposure to market gain or loss will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nlosses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.\nThe following table represents the consolidated balance sheets location and amount of derivative instrument fair values segregated between designated and non-designated hedge instruments:\nThe following table represents, for designated hedge instruments, net of tax, the respective locations in the consolidated statements of operations and the amount of gains and losses on derivative instrument fair values:\nOther Commitments - Credit and Term Loan Facilities\nOn November 28, 2016, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders (the Credit Agreement) providing for (i) a $650.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan). The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company\u2019s previous credit agreement dated May 19, 2015, in order to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $500.0 million to $650.0 million, provide a new $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility, and to extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from May 19, 2020 to November 28, 2021. Subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the Credit Agreement may be increased by the Company by up to an additional $150.0 million. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of October 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nAs of October 31, 2020, the Company had an outstanding balance of $102.1 million, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan, of which $75.0 million was classified as long-term liabilities. Outstanding principal payments under the Term Loan are due as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2019, the Company had $119.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan, of which $102.2 million was classified as long-term liabilities.\nThere was no outstanding balance under the Revolver as of October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2019. The Company expects its borrowings under the Revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nThe Term Loan and Revolver borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over the Company\u2019s choice of market observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2020, borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR +1.000%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on the Company\u2019s leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.\nIn July 2018, the Company entered into a 12-year $220.0 million RMB (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support its facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5 year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%. As of October 31, 2020, the Company had $25.8 million outstanding under the agreement.\nThe carrying amount of the short-term and long-term debt approximates the estimated fair value. These borrowings under the Credit Agreement have a variable interest rate structure and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nNote 7. Fair Value Measures\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value, establishes guidelines and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The accounting guidance requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The accounting guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the independence of the source and objective evidence of the inputs used. There are three fair value hierarchies based upon the level of inputs that are significant to fair value measurement:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;\nLevel 2-Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs to the valuation derived from fair valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nOn a recurring basis, the Company measures the fair value of certain of its assets and liabilities, which include cash equivalents, non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets, and foreign currency derivative contracts.\nThe Company\u2019s cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because they are valued using quoted market prices in an active market or alternative independent pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.\nThe Company\u2019s non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets consist of money market and mutual funds invested in domestic and international marketable securities that are directly observable in active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 because these contracts are not actively traded and the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nThe Company\u2019s borrowings under its credit and term loan facilities are classified within Level 2 because these borrowings are not actively traded and have a variable interest rate structure based upon market rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities. See Note 6. Financial Assets and Liabilities for more information on these borrowings.\nAssets/Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of October 31, 2020:\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of October 31, 2019:\nAssets/Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nEquity investments in privately-held companies, also called non-marketable equity securities, are accounted for using either the measurement alternative or equity method of accounting.\nThe non-marketable equity securities are measured and recorded at fair value when an event or circumstance which impacts the fair value of these securities indicates that the securities are impaired and the fair value of the securities is less than the carrying value. In such events, these equity investments would be classified within Level 3 as they are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market, and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of market price and inherent lack of liquidity. The Company monitors these investments and generally uses the income approach to assess impairments based primarily on the financial conditions of these companies.\nNote 8. Leases\nThe Company has operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets. These leases have various expiration dates through March 31, 2032, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 10 years. Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments are excluded from lease payments.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe components of the Company\u2019s lease expense during the period presented are as follows:\n(1) Variable lease expense includes payments to lessors that are not fixed or determinable at lease commencement date. These payments primarily consist of maintenance, property taxes, insurance and variable indexed based payments.\nSupplemental cash flow information during the period presented is as follows:\nLease term and discount rate information related to the Company\u2019s operating leases as of the end of the period presented are as follows:\nThe following represents the maturities of the Company\u2019s future lease payments due under operating leases as of October 31, 2020:\nAs of October 31, 2020, the Company has additional operating leases for facilities that have not yet commenced with future undiscounted lease payments of $58.6 million. These operating leases will commence before March 1, 2021, with lease terms between 3 years and 9 years.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nAs of October 31, 2019, the future minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows:\n(1) Amounts based on Topic 840, Leases.\nIn addition, certain facilities owned by the Company were leased to 3rd parties under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. These leases have annual escalating payments and have expiration dates through March 31, 2031 in accordance with the terms and conditions of the existing agreement. Lease payments due to the Company, over the remaining life of the leases, are approximately $69.6 million as of October 31, 2020.\nNote 9. Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of its business. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is often uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The Company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is estimable, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and as circumstances change, it is possible that the amount of any accrued liability may increase, decrease, or be eliminated.\nThe Company has determined that, except as set forth below, no disclosure of estimated loss is required for a claim against the Company because: (1) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (2) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (3) such estimate is immaterial.\nMentor Patent Litigation\nPrior to the legal settlement as further described below, the Company was engaged in complex patent litigation with Mentor Graphics Corporation (Mentor) involving several actions in different forums. The Company succeeded to the litigation when it acquired Emulation & Verification Engineering S.A. on October 4, 2012.\nLegal Settlement\nIn March 2017, Siemens PLM Software (Siemens) acquired Mentor. On June 29, 2018, the Company, Siemens and Mentor settled all outstanding patent litigation between the Company and Mentor for a $65.0 million payment made in the current quarter from the Company to Mentor. The Company had previously accrued $39.0 million and recorded the remaining $26.0 million as an expense in the quarter ended July 31, 2018. As a result of the settlement, the litigation with Mentor was dismissed and the injunction entered in connection with that litigation was vacated. The settlement included mutual seven-year patent cross-licenses between the Company and Siemens, and between the Company and Mentor. The Company and Mentor also amended an existing interoperability agreement to collaborate on a wide range of EDA products for the benefit of their mutual customers. The amendment includes a one-time termination charge between $0.0 and $25.0 million, payable to Mentor under certain conditions.\nTax Matters\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe Company undergoes examination from time to time by U.S. and foreign authorities for non-income based taxes, such as sales, use and value-added taxes, and is currently under examination by tax authorities in certain jurisdictions. If the potential loss from such examinations is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss could be estimated, the Company would accrue a liability for the estimated expense. In addition to the foregoing, the Company is, from time to time, party to various other claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business, including with tax and other governmental authorities. For a description of certain of these other matters, refer to Note 13. Income Taxes.\nNote 10. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComponents of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), on an after-tax basis where applicable, were as follows:\nThe effect of amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income was as follows:\nAmounts reclassified in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 primarily consisted of gains (losses) from the Company\u2019s cash flow hedging activities. See Note 6. Financial Assets and Liabilities.\nNote 11. Stock Repurchase Program\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the Board) previously approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company was authorized to purchase up to $500.0 million of its common stock and has periodically replenished the stock repurchase program to such amount. The Board replenished the stock repurchase program up to $500.0 million on June 19, 2020. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company's Chief Financial Officer or the Board. The Company repurchases shares to offset dilution caused by ongoing stock issuances from existing equity plans for equity compensation awards and issuances related to acquisitions, and when management believes it is a good use of cash. Repurchases are transacted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and may be made through any means, including, but not limited to, open market purchases, plans executed under Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act and structured transactions. As of October 31, 2020, $457.9 million remained available for future repurchases under the program.\nIn December 2019, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the December 2019 ASR) to repurchase an aggregate of $100.0 million of the Company's common stock. Pursuant to the December 2019 ASR, the Company made a prepayment of $100.0 million to receive initial share deliveries of shares valued at $80.0 million. The remaining balance of $20.0 million was settled in February 2020. Total shares purchased under the December 2019 ASR were approximately 0.7 million shares, at an average purchase price of $149.75 per share.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nIn February 2020, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the February 2020 ASR) to repurchase an aggregate of $100.0 million of the Company\u2019s common stock. Pursuant to the February 2020 ASR, the Company made a prepayment of $100.0 million to receive initial share deliveries of shares valued at $80.0 million. The remaining balance of $20.0 million was settled in May 2020. Total shares purchased under the February 2020 ASR were approximately 0.7 million shares, at an average purchase price of $140.41 per share.\nStock repurchase activities as well as the reissuance of treasury stock for employee stock-based compensation purposes are as follows:\n(1)\nThe first quarter of fiscal 2018 includes the settlement of the $20.0 million equity forward contract related to the September 2017 ASR.\nNote 12. Employee Benefit Plans\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Company\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), participating employees are granted the right to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at (1) the beginning of an offering period (generally, a rolling two year period) or (2) the purchase date (generally occurring at the end of each semi-annual purchase period), subject to the terms of ESPP, including a limit on the number of shares that may be purchased in a purchase period.\nOn April 9, 2020, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved an amendment to the ESPP to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan by 5.0 million shares. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued 1.0 million, 1.2 million, and 1.2 million shares, respectively, under the ESPP at average per share prices of $103.41, $73.18 and $62.52, respectively. As of October 31, 2020, 13.8 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.\nEquity Compensation Plans\n2006 Employee Equity Incentive Plan. On April 25, 2006, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the 2006 Employee Equity Incentive Plan (2006 Employee Plan), which provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights and other forms of equity compensation, including performance stock awards and performance cash awards, as determined by the plan administrator. The terms and conditions of each type of award are set forth in the 2006 Employee Plan and in the award agreements governing particular awards. Options granted under this plan generally have a contractual term of seven years and generally vest over four years. On April 9, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to, among other things, increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2006 Employee Plan by 3.5 million shares. As of October 31, 2020, an aggregate of 3.9 million stock options and 4.1 million restricted stock units were outstanding, and 12.1 million shares were available for future issuance under the 2006 Employee Plan.\n2005 and 2017 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plans. On April 6, 2017, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (2017 Directors Plan). In connection with stockholder approval of the 2017 Directors Plan, the 2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Directors Plan) was terminated as of April 6, 2017, and no awards can be granted under the 2005 Directors Plan after that date.\nUnder the 2005 Directors Plan, the Company granted options to purchase 188,709 shares of common stock, which vest over a period of three to four years, with an aggregate grant date fair value of $6.7 million, to non-employee\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\ndirectors during fiscal 2007, fiscal 2011, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2017. As of October 31, 2020, 29,222 stock options were outstanding under the 2005 Directors Plan.\nThe 2017 Directors Plan provides for equity awards to non-employee directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock or a combination thereof. On April 6, 2017, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved an aggregate of 0.45 million shares of common stock reserved under the 2017 Directors Plan.\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of 9,412 shares of restricted stock awards with an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $1.3 million under the 2017 Directors Plan. Restricted stock awards generally vest on an annual basis under the 2017 Directors Plan. In addition, the Company granted options to purchase 5,998 shares of common stock, which vest over a period of three years, with an aggregate grant date fair value of $1.4 million. As of October 31, 2020, 9,412 shares of restricted stock were unvested and 5,998 stock options were outstanding, and a total of 389,682 shares of common stock were reserved for future grant under the 2017 Directors Plan.\nOther Assumed Stock Plans through Acquisitions. In connection with the Company\u2019s acquisitions in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2010, fiscal 2012, fiscal 2014, fiscal 2015, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2018 the Company assumed certain outstanding stock awards of acquired companies. If these assumed equity awards are canceled, forfeited or expire unexercised, the underlying shares do not become available for future grant. As of October 31, 2020, 0.1 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock remained subject to such outstanding assumed equity awards.\nRestricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units are granted under the 2006 Employee Plan as part of the Company\u2019s incentive compensation program. In general, restricted stock units vest over three to four years and are subject to the employee's continuing service with the Company. Certain restricted stock units were granted with specific performance criteria and vest to the extent performance conditions are met. For each restricted stock unit granted under the 2006 Employee Plan, a share reserve ratio is applied for the purpose of determining the remaining number of shares reserved for future grants under the plan. As of October 31, 2020, the share reserve ratio was 1.70.\nThe following table contains information concerning activities related to restricted stock units:\n(1)\nThe number of vested restricted stock units includes shares that were withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.\n(2)\nThe Company assumed unvested restricted stock units from acquisitions including Black Duck.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe following table contains additional information concerning activities related to stock options and restricted stock units under all equity plans, other than shares available for grant under the 2017 Directors Plan:\n(1)\nThese amounts do not reflect the actual number of restricted stock units granted or forfeited but rather the effect on the total remaining shares available for future grants after the application of the share reserve ratio. For more information about the share reserve ratio, please see Restricted Stock Units above.\n(2)\nThe Company assumed options outstanding under various plans through acquisitions.\n(3)\nExcluding shares reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Directors Plan.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the pretax intrinsic value based on stock options with an exercise price less than the Company\u2019s closing stock price of $213.86 as of October 31, 2020. The pretax intrinsic value of options exercised and their average exercise prices were:\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nRestricted stock award activities during fiscal 2020 under the 2005 Directors Plan and 2017 Directors Plan are summarized as follows:\nValuation and Expense of Stock-Based Compensation. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards in the form of stock options and employee stock purchase rights under employee stock purchase plans on the grant date. The value of awards expected to vest is recognized as expense over the applicable service periods. The Company uses the straight-line attribution method to recognize stock-based compensation costs over the service period of the award except for performance grants with specific performance criteria. With respect to such performance grants in each reporting period, the Company estimates the probability of achievement of applicable performance goals and recognizes related stock-based compensation expense using the graded-vesting method. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or expected attainment of the various performance goals. If such performance goals are not ultimately met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, stock appreciation rights and employee stock purchase plan awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and interest rates. The expected volatility for both stock options and stock purchase rights under the ESPP is estimated by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of the Company\u2019s common stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of the Company\u2019s stock-based awards. The expected term of the Company\u2019s stock-based awards is based on historical experience. Restricted stock units are valued based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date.\nThe assumptions presented in the following table were used to estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase rights granted under the Company\u2019s stock plans or stock plans assumed from acquisitions:\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe compensation cost recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the Company's stock compensation arrangements was as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2020, the Company had $488.6 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relating to options and restricted stock units and awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years. As of October 31, 2020, the Company had $55.8 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relating to the ESPP, which is expected to be recognized over a period of 2.0 years.\nDeferred Compensation Plan. The Company maintains the Synopsys Deferred Compensation Plan (Deferred Plan), which permits eligible employees to defer up to 50% of their annual cash base compensation and up to 100% of their eligible cash variable compensation. Amounts may be withdrawn from the Deferred Plan pursuant to elections made by the employees in accordance with the terms of the plan. Since the inception of the Deferred Plan, the Company has not made any matching or discretionary contributions to the Deferred Plan. There are no Deferred Plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or minimum return on investments. Undistributed amounts under the Deferred Plan are subject to the claims of the Company\u2019s creditors. The securities held by the Deferred Plan are classified as trading securities.\nDeferred plan assets and liabilities are as follows:\n(1)\nUndistributed deferred compensation balances due to participants.\nIncome or loss from the change in fair value of the Deferred Plan assets is recorded in other income (expense), net. The increase or decrease in the fair value of the undistributed Deferred Plan obligation is recorded in total cost of revenue and operating expense. The following table summarizes the impact of the Deferred Plan:\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nOther Retirement Plans. The Company sponsors various retirement plans for its eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total contributions to these plans were $54.7 million, $50.7 million, and $56.5 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. For employees in the United States and Canada, the Company matches pretax employee contributions up to a maximum of U.S. $3,000 and Canadian $4,000, respectively, per participant per year.\nNote 13. Income Taxes\nThe domestic and foreign components of the Company\u2019s total income (loss) before provision for income taxes are as follows:\nThe components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes were as follows:\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the taxes computed with the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:\nThe integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among company-controlled entities. These intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a company-controlled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), enacted on December 22, 2017, lowered the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018. Beginning in the Company's fiscal 2019, the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is 21%.\nThe Tax Act includes certain new tax provisions listed below which apply to the Company beginning in fiscal 2019.\n\u2022\nA tax on global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), which is determined annually based on the Company's aggregate foreign subsidiaries' income in excess of certain qualified business asset investment return. In fiscal 2019, the Company adopted an accounting policy to account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax.\n\u2022\nA base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which functions as a minimum tax that partially disallows deductions for certain related party transactions and certain tax credits.\n\u2022\nA special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), which, in general, allows a deduction of certain intangible income earned in the U.S. and derived from foreign sources.\nThe Tax Act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. The Company has provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of its foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.\nThe Tax Act required the Company to pay a one-time transition tax of 15.5% on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a tax expense of $63.1 million. Based on subsequent judicial rulings in fiscal 2019 (including Altera Corp. et al. v. Commissioner and the Hungarian Administrative Court ruling, see Non-U.S. Examinations below) the Company recorded a tax benefit of $17.9 million related to the one-time transition tax.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nOn July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court (Tax Court) issued an opinion (Altera Corp. et al. v. Commissioner) regarding the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in intercompany cost-sharing arrangements. In view of the Tax Court opinion, the Company amended its cost-sharing arrangement effective February 1, 2016 to exclude stock-based compensation expense on a prospective basis and reflected the corresponding benefits in its income tax expense for fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018. On July 24, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) reversed the decision of the Tax Court, and then subsequently withdrew its decision on August 7, 2018. A rehearing of the case was held on October 16, 2018 and on June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit overturned the July 27, 2015 Tax Court decision. In the third quarter of 2019, as a result of the Ninth Circuit decision, the Company recorded a tax expense of $18.3 million, which is net of estimated U.S. foreign tax credits for the tax assessments related to fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Company's intercompany cost-sharing arrangement was terminated at the end of fiscal 2018 as part of the tax restructuring.\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nIt is more likely than not that the results of future operations will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance provided against the Company's deferred tax assets as of October 31, 2020 is mainly attributable to international foreign tax credits and the California research credits. The valuation allowance increased by a net of $1.6 million in fiscal 2020 primarily related to the realizability of U.S. foreign tax credits offset by the net increase of valuation allowance on California research credits.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe Company has the following tax loss and credit carryforwards available to offset future income tax liabilities:\nThe federal and state net operating loss carryforward is from acquired companies and the annual use of such loss is subject to significant limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and certain provisions of the Tax Act. Foreign tax credits may only be used to offset tax attributable to foreign source income.\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by approximately $33.1 million during fiscal 2020 resulting in gross unrecognized tax benefits of $83.1 million as of October 31, 2020. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately $83.1 million and $116.2 million, respectively, of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized upon resolution of the uncertain tax positions.\nInterest and penalties related to estimated obligations for tax positions taken in the Company\u2019s tax returns are recognized as a component of income tax expense (benefit) in the consolidated statements of operations and totaled approximately $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $9.4 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on the Company\u2019s tax returns was approximately $13.1 million and $12.8 million, respectively.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations, and the amounts and timing of various tax payments that are part of the settlement process, are highly uncertain. Variations in such amounts and/or timing could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. The Company believes that in the coming 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits and ongoing tax litigation will conclude or the statute of limitations on certain state and foreign income and withholding taxes will expire, or both. Given the uncertainty as to ultimate settlement terms, the timing of payment and the impact of such settlements on other uncertain tax positions, the range of the estimated potential decrease in underlying unrecognized tax benefits is between $0.0 and $42.5 million.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nThe Company and/or its subsidiaries remain subject to tax examination in the following jurisdictions:\nIn addition, the Company has made acquisitions with operations in several of its significant jurisdictions which may have years subject to examination different from the years indicated in the above table.\nIntra-Entity Transfers of Assets\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.\u201d This ASU requires the immediate recognition of current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This ASU was adopted on the first day of fiscal 2019. As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded a decrease of approximately $130.5 million in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption, with a corresponding decrease in prepaid taxes related to the unamortized tax expense attributed to intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory previously deferred. The Company will recognize the income tax consequences of new intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in the consolidated statements of operations in the period when the transaction takes place.\nIRS Examinations\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company reached partial settlement with the Examination Division of the IRS for fiscal 2019 and recognized approximately $6.3 million in unrecognized tax benefits, primarily due to the allowance of certain foreign tax credits and research tax credits.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company reached final settlement with the Examination Division of the IRS for fiscal 2018 and recognized approximately $5.4 million in unrecognized tax benefits and realized $28.1 million of foreign tax credits.\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company reached final settlement with the Examination Division of the IRS for fiscal 2017 and recognized approximately $21.8 million in unrecognized tax benefits, primarily due to the allowance of certain foreign tax credits, and research tax credits from acquired companies.\nState Examinations\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company reached final settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board for fiscal 2015, 2016, and 2017. As a result of the settlement, the Company recognized $20.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits and increased its valuation allowance by $20.2 million.\nNon-U.S. Examinations\nHungarian Tax Authority\nIn July 2017, the Hungarian Tax Authority (the HTA) issued a final assessment against the Company's Hungarian subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. The HTA has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million (at current exchange rates). On August 2, 2017, Synopsys Hungary filed a claim contesting the final assessment with the Hungarian Administrative Court. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Synopsys Hungary paid the assessments, penalties and interest as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on its balance sheet, while continuing its challenge to the assessment through the Hungarian Administrative Court. On April 30, 2019, the Hungarian Administrative Court (the Court) ruled against Synopsys Hungary. The Court's opinion was received on May 16, 2019 and the Company filed an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court on July 5, 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of the Court's decision, the Company\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nrecorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of $17.4 million, which is net of estimated U.S. foreign tax credits for the tax assessments. The Hungarian Supreme Court heard the Company's appeal on November 12, 2020 and issued a ruling from the bench to remand the case to the Hungarian Administrative Court for further proceedings. The Company expects to receive the Hungarian Supreme Court's written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company reached final settlement with the HTA for fiscal years 2014 through 2018. As a result of the settlement, the Company recognized tax expense of $1.4 million, and recognized $6.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits.\nNational Taxation Bureau of Taipei\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company reached final settlement with the National Taxation Bureau of Taipei for fiscal year 2017 and recognized $5.5 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits.\nNote 14. Other Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents the components of other income (expense), net:\nNote 15. Segment Disclosure\nSegment reporting is based upon the \u201cmanagement approach,\u201d i.e., how management organizes the Company\u2019s operating segments for which separate financial information is (1) available and (2) evaluated regularly by the CODMs in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Synopsys\u2019 CODMs are its two Co-Chief Executive Officers.\nFinancial information provided to and used by the CODMs to assist in making operational decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance reflects consolidated financial information as well as revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating margin information for the Semiconductor & System Design and Software Integrity segments, accompanied by disaggregated information relating to revenue by geographic region.\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nInformation by reportable segment was as follows:\nCertain operating expenses are not allocated to the segments and are managed at a consolidated level. The unallocated expenses managed at a consolidated level, including amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation and other operating expenses, are presented in the table below to provide a reconciliation of the total adjusted operating income from segments to the Company's consolidated operating income:\nThe CODMs do not use total assets by segment to evaluate segment performance or allocate resources. As a result, total assets by segment are not required to be disclosed.\nIn allocating revenue to particular geographic areas, the CODMs consider where individual \u201cseats\u201d or licenses to the Company\u2019s products are located. Revenue is defined as revenue from external customers. Revenue and property and equipment, net, related to operations in the United States and other geographic areas were:\nSYNOPSYS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued\nGeographic revenue data for multi-regional, multi-product transactions reflect internal allocations and are therefore subject to certain assumptions and to the Company\u2019s methodology.\nOne customer, including its subsidiaries, accounted for 12.4%, 12.8%, and 15.4% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nNote 16. Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13) and subsequently issued amendments to the initial guidance: ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2019-05 (collectively, Topic 326). Topic 326 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. Topic 326 is effective for fiscal 2021, and earlier adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The adoption of Topic 326 will not have material impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nSupplementary Data - Selected Unaudited Quarterly Financial Data\nThe table below includes certain unaudited financial information for the last eight fiscal quarters. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information on the Company's fiscal year end.\n(1) Net income per share is computed independently. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly net income per share may not equal to the total computed for the year or any cumulative interim period.",

As of October 31, 2020, Synopsys carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Synopsys\u2019 management, including the Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Synopsys\u2019 disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 31, 2020, Synopsys\u2019 disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports Synopsys files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Synopsys\u2019 management, including the Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding its required disclosure.\n(b)\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for Synopsys.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020. In assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management used the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nOur management has concluded that, as of October 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an auditors\u2019 report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.\n(c)\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. On November 3, 2019, Synopsys implemented new and modified existing internal controls for the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, ASC 842. There were no additional changes in Synopsys\u2019 internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Synopsys\u2019 internal control over financial reporting.",
