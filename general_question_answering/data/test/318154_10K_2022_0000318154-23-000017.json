    "item_1": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nAmgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as \u201cAmgen,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a biotechnology company committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.\nAmgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people\u2019s lives. A biotechnology pioneer, Amgen has grown to be one of the world\u2019s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.\nAmgen was incorporated in California in 1980 and became a Delaware corporation in 1987. We have a presence in approximately 100 countries worldwide. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics.\nSignificant Developments\nFollowing is a summary of significant developments affecting our business that have occurred and that we have reported since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAcquisitions\nProposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc\n\u2022On December 12, 2022, we announced that we entered into a transaction agreement under which Amgen will acquire all shares of Horizon for $116.50 per share in cash for a transaction equity value of approximately $27.8 billion. In connection with the proposed acquisition of Horizon, in December 2022 we entered into a bridge credit agreement and a term loan credit agreement with an aggregate principal amount of $28.5 billion. Horizon is a global biotechnology company headquartered in Dublin, Ireland and is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of medicines that address critical needs for people impacted by rare, autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases. Horizon has 12 marketed medicines and a pipeline with more than 20 development programs. The closing of this transaction is contingent upon satisfaction of certain regulatory (including FTC review) and other customary closing conditions.\n\u25e6On January 30, 2023, the Company and Horizon each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (Second Request) from the FTC in connection with the FTC\u2019s review of the Company\u2019s proposed acquisition of Horizon. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, until 30 days after the Company and Horizon have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the Company and Horizon or terminated sooner by the FTC.\nChemoCentryx, Inc.\n\u2022On October 20, 2022, we completed our acquisition of ChemoCentryx for $52.00 per share in cash totaling approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash acquired.\nProducts/Pipeline\nCardiometabolic\nRepatha\n\u2022In 2022, we presented results from the Repatha FOURIER-OLE studies, two open label extension (OLE) studies (with 6,635 patients) to the Phase 3 FOURIER cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial. FOURIER-OLE was designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha in adults with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In these studies, an exploratory analysis demonstrated that earlier initiation of Repatha resulted in a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes as defined by the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and the incidence of serious adverse events did not increase over time.\nOlpasiran\n\u2022In November 2022, we presented positive end-of-treatment results from the Phase 2 OCEAN(a)-DOSE study evaluating olpasiran in adult patients with lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), levels over 150 nmol/L and a history of ASCVD. Olpasiran is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to lower the body\u2019s production of apolipoprotein(a), a key component of Lp(a) that has been associated with an increased risk of CV events. In the double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period, olpasiran was administered up to 225 mg subcutaneously every 12 weeks to patients with a median baseline Lp(a) of approximately 260 nmol/L. Patients who received a 75 mg or higher dose every 12 weeks had a 95% or greater reduction in Lp(a) compared to placebo at week 36. Overall, the rates of adverse events were similar in the olpasiran and placebo arms.\nInflammation\nTEZSPIRE\n\u2022In September 2022, the EC approved TEZSPIRE in the EU as an add-on therapy in patients 12 years and older with severe asthma who are inadequately controlled with high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. The approval follows the recommendation by the CHMP of the EMA in July 2022.\nABP 654\n\u2022In April 2022, we announced preliminary results from a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 654 compared to STELARA (ustekinumab) in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The study met the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 654 and STELARA.\nOncology/Hematology\nLUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS\n\u2022In April 2022, we announced long-term efficacy and safety data from the CodeBreaK 100 Phase 1/2 trial in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS. In 174 heavily pre-treated patients (172 with baseline measurable lesion(s)), LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS demonstrated a centrally confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 40.7%, disease control rate of 83.7% and median duration of response (DOR) of 12.3 months. The results also showed median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.3 months and overall survival of 12.5 months, with 32.5% of patients still alive at two years. No new safety signals for LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS were identified with the long-term follow-up.\n\u2022In September 2022, we announced results from the global Phase 3 CodeBreaK 200 trial, which showed once-daily oral LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS led to significantly superior PFS (primary endpoint) and a significantly higher ORR (a key secondary endpoint) in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, compared with intravenous chemotherapy, docetaxel. LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS significantly improved PFS compared to docetaxel in heavily pre-treated patients. The proportion of patients with PFS at one year was 25% for LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS versus 10% for docetaxel. LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS demonstrated a significantly higher ORR than docetaxel with double the response rates in the LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS arm (28% versus 13%, respectively).\nABP 959\n\u2022In August 2022, we announced positive top-line results from the DAHLIA study, a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, two-period crossover Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 959, a biosimilar candidate to SOLIRIS (eculizumab), compared with SOLIRIS in adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The study met its primary endpoints, demonstrating no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 959 and SOLIRIS. The safety and immunogenicity profile of ABP 959 was comparable to that of SOLIRIS.\nNew manufacturing facility\n\u2022In March 2022, we broke ground to build a drug substance plant in North Carolina that will increase our manufacturing network capacity.\nMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products\nThe largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces is based in the United States and Europe. In recent years, we have expanded the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories, including Japan, China and other parts of Asia; Latin America; and the Middle East. This expansion has occurred, and is expected to continue to occur, by establishing our own affiliates, by acquiring existing third-party businesses or product rights or by collaborating with third parties. See Business Relationships for our significant alliances. Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third party\u2019s services varies across these markets. Such use typically depends on several factors, including the nature of entry into the new market, the size of an opportunity and operational capabilities. Together with our collaborators, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.\nIn the United States, substantially all of our sales are to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, which are the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products through direct-to-consumer channels, including print, television and online media. For further discussion, see Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. In the Asia Pacific region, we also sell our products in partnership with other companies, including Astellas Pharma Inc., BeiGene, KKC, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.\nOur product sales to three large wholesalers, McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years 2022, 2021 and 2020. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for 82%, 82% and 83% of worldwide gross revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit or obtaining credit insurance.\nOur products are marketed around the world, with the United States as our largest market. The following chart shows our product sales by principal product, and the table below (dollar amounts in millions) shows product sales by geography for the years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n____________\n(1) Consists of product sales of our non-principal products, as well as our Gensenta and Bergamo subsidiaries.\nENBREL\nWe market ENBREL, a tumor necrosis factor blocker, in the United States and Canada. ENBREL was launched in 1998 and is used primarily in indications for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and patients with active psoriatic arthritis.\nProlia\nWe market Prolia in many countries around the world. Prolia contains the same active ingredient as XGEVA but is approved for different indications, patient populations, dose and frequency of administration. Prolia was launched in the United States and Europe in 2010. In the United States, it is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or in patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In Europe, Prolia is used primarily for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture.\nOtezla\nWe market Otezla, a small molecule that inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), in many countries around the world. Otezla was acquired from Bristol Myers Squibb Company in November 2019 after their acquisition of Celgene. Otezla is an oral therapy approved for the treatment of adults with plaque psoriasis across all severities (United States and Japan) and moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (other global markets including Europe), for adults with active psoriatic arthritis and for adults with oral ulcers associated with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.\nXGEVA\nWe market XGEVA in many countries around the world. XGEVA was launched in 2010 and is used primarily in the indication for prevention of skeletal-related events (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and multiple myeloma.\nAranesp\nWe market Aranesp primarily in the United States and Europe. Aranesp was launched in 2001 and is indicated to treat a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. Aranesp is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy in certain patients with nonmyeloid malignancies and when chemotherapy will be used for at least two months after starting Aranesp.\nNplate\nWe market Nplate in many countries around the world. Nplate was launched in 2008 and is indicated to treat thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy.\nRepatha\nWe market Repatha, a PCSK9 inhibitor, in many countries around the world. Repatha was launched in 2015 and is indicated to reduce the risks of myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary revascularization in adults with established CV disease. Repatha is also indicated to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).\nKYPROLIS\nWe market KYPROLIS primarily in the United States and Europe. KYPROLIS was launched in 2012 and is indicated in combination with (i) dexamethasone, (ii) lenalidomide plus dexamethasone and (iii) DARZALEX plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. It is also approved as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more previous therapies.\nNeulasta\nWe market Neulasta, a pegylated protein based on the filgrastim molecule, primarily in the United States and Europe. Neulasta was launched in 2002 and is used primarily in the indication to help reduce the chance of infection due to a low white blood cell count in patients with certain types of cancer (nonmyeloid) who receive anticancer medicines (chemotherapy) that can cause fever and a low blood cell count. In 2015, the Neulasta Onpro kit became available in the United States. The Neulasta Onpro kit provides physicians the opportunity to initiate administration of Neulasta on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery of the recommended dose of Neulasta at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving the patient a trip back to the doctor.\nEVENITY\nTogether with our collaboration partners, we market EVENITY in many countries around the world. EVENITY was launched in the United States and Japan in 2019. In the United States, it is used in the indication for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. In Japan, EVENITY is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk of fracture.\nOther Marketed Products\nWe also market a number of other products in various markets worldwide, including MVASI, Vectibix, BLINCYTO, EPOGEN, AMGEVITA, Aimovig, Parsabiv, KANJINTI, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, TEZSPIRE, NEUPOGEN, Sensipar/Mimpara and TAVNEOS.\nPatents\nThe following table lists our outstanding material patents for the indicated product by territory, general subject matter and latest expiry date. Certain of the European patents are subjects of supplemental protection certificates that provide additional protection for the products in certain European countries beyond the dates listed in the table. See footnotes to the patent table below.\nOne or more patents with the same or earlier expiry dates may fall under the same general subject matter and are not listed separately.\n(1)A European patent with this subject matter may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe, and the length of any such extension will vary by country. For example, supplementary protection certificates have been issued related to the indicated products for patents in at least the following countries:\n\u2022denosumab - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2025\n\u2022apremilast - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom expiring in 2028\n\u2022carfilzomib - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom expiring in 2030\n\u2022evolocumab - France, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2030\n\u2022romiplostim - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2024\n\u2022romosozumab - France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2031\n\u2022blinatumomab - France, Germany, Italy and Spain, expiring in 2029\n\u2022erenumab - France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2033\n\u2022etelcalcetide - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2031\n(2)U.S. Patent No. 10,092,541 was held invalid by the New Jersey District Court. We disagree with the court\u2019s holding and we are in the process of appealing this judgment. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Amgen Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., et al.\n(3)A patent with this subject matter may be entitled to patent term extension in the United States.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. A number of our marketed products are indicated for disease areas in which other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through R&D activities. Additionally, some competitor-marketed products target the same genetic pathways as our recently launched marketed products or are currently in development. This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products. We continue to pursue ways of increasing the value of our medicines through innovations during their life cycles, which can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly. Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation. For example, we market the Neulasta Onpro kit, which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving the patient a trip back to the doctor. We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position. Such position may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience, delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration.\nCertain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired, and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars and generics. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is \u201chighly similar\u201d to the original reference product. We have experienced adverse effects from biosimilar competition on our originator product sales. Companies have launched biosimilar versions of EPOGEN, NEUPOGEN and Neulasta and have approved biosimilars for ENBREL. Once multiple biosimilar versions of one of our originator products have launched, competition has intensified rapidly, resulting in greater net price declines for both reference and biosimilar products and a greater effect on product sales. See also Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Approval of Biosimilars. Although competitor biosimilars compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, supply reliability and safety of our products. As additional biosimilar competitors come to market, we will continue to leverage our global experience to distinguish against both branded and biosimilar competition.\nWe also have our own biosimilar products both in the United States and outside of U.S. markets that are competing against branded and biosimilar versions of our competitors\u2019 products. In 2019, Amgen launched MVASI, a biosimilar to Avastin, and KANJINTI, a biosimilar to Herceptin; and in 2018, Amgen launched AMGEVITA, a biosimilar to HUMIRA in markets outside the United States. We have also received FDA approval of AMJEVITA, a biosimilar to HUMIRA for the U.S. market, which launched in January 2023. In 2020, we launched AVSOLA, a biosimilar to Remicade; and in 2021 we launched RIABNI, a biosimilar to Rituxan. We expect additional biosimilar competition against both our branded and biosimilar products in the future across markets.\nAlthough most of our products are biologics, some are small molecule products. Because the FDA approval process permits generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than having to conduct their own costly and time-consuming clinical trials, generic manufacturers can often develop and market their competing versions of our small molecule products at much lower prices. For example, following loss of exclusivity of patents directed to cinacalcet, the active ingredient in our small molecule calcimimetic Sensipar, we lost a significant share of the market and corresponding revenues in a very short period of time. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in (i) increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents and/or (ii) reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates. (As used in this document, the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies.) See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors-We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.\nThe following table reflects our significant competitors and is not exhaustive.\n\u2020 Approved biosimilars available in Europe and Canada.\n(1)A subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.\n(2)PROCRIT competes with Aranesp in supportive cancer care and predialysis settings.\n(3)REVLIMID also includes generics.\n(4)A subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.\n(5)A subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb Company.\n(6)Other biosimilars under regulatory review in the United States and Europe.\nReimbursement\nSales of our products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare; and their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs, economic pressures and broader challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Drugs remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and are scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefits such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. These pressures become intensified when our products become subject to competition, including from biosimilars.\nIn the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and PBMs are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private-payer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We provide negotiated rebates to healthcare providers, private payers, government payers and PBMs. In addition, we are required to (i) provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program.\nBoth private and some government payers use formularies to manage access to and utilization of drugs. A drug\u2019s inclusion and favorable positioning on a formulary are essential to ensure patients have access to a particular drug. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients\u2019 use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug, higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion, which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Furthermore, during the past few years, many PBMs and insurers have consolidated, resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL, Otezla, Repatha and Aimovig, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position.\nIn addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers in both of the major U.S. political parties have supported policies to lower drug costs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted and includes provisions requiring that (1) beginning in 2026, mandatory price setting be introduced in Medicare for certain drugs paid for under Parts B and D, whereby manufacturers must accept a price established by the government or face penalties on all U.S. sales (starting with 10 drugs in 2026, adding 15 in 2027 and 2028, and adding 20 in 2029 and subsequent years such that by 2031 approximately 100 drugs could be subject to such set prices); (2) starting in 2024, Medicare Part D be redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance be reduced in the catastrophic phase (resulting in a shift and increase of such costs to Part D plans and manufacturers, including by requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs); and (3) beginning October 1, 2022, manufacturers now owe rebates on drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part D if price increases outpace inflation, and beginning January 1, 2023, now owe rebates on drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part B if price increases outpace inflation. Although the IRA has passed, the environment remains dynamic, and the Administration and Congress are continuing to consider drug pricing reforms.\nOther potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; increasing transparency in drug pricing; and using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law on November 15, 2021, requires manufacturers of certain Part B-covered drugs packaged in single-use containers to give refunds to the government starting in 2023 for discarded amounts.\nIn many countries other than the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in mandates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies; and these organizations are expanding in both established and emerging markets. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that countries will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The EU is currently undergoing a review and possible revision of its pharmaceutical legislation, now scheduled to end in the first half of 2023, with implementation by 2025 or 2026. It is likely that this review will lead to proposals that will reduce intellectual property protection for new products, as well as change the reimbursement and regulatory landscape in ways that are difficult to predict at this point.\nThe dynamics and developments discussed above create pressures on the pricing and potential usage of our products and on the industry. Given the diverse interests in play between payers, biopharmaceutical manufacturers, policy makers, healthcare providers and independent organizations, if and whether the parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear, and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:\n\u2022investing billions of dollars annually in R&D;\n\u2022pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;\n\u2022developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars;\n\u2022partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;\n\u2022providing patient support and education programs;\n\u2022helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and\n\u2022working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and in which patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.\nManufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials\nManufacturing\nWe believe we are a leader in the manufacture of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Further, our expertise in the manufacture of biologics positions us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties.\nWe have been innovating our manufacturing facilities designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and/or by mitigating risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products. For example, our licensed next-generation biomanufacturing plants operating in Singapore and West Greenwich, Rhode Island, incorporate multiple innovative technologies into a single facility. Next-generation biomanufacturing plants require smaller manufacturing footprints and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. Within such plants, the equipment is portable and smaller, which provides greater flexibility and speed in the manufacture of different medicines simultaneously. This enables Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility. The Singapore site also has a plant that has been approved by several agencies, including the FDA and EMA, to produce small molecule drugs for commercial manufacturing.\nOur internal manufacturing network has commercial production capabilities for bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, finish, tableting and device assembly. These activities are performed within the United States and its territory in our Puerto Rico, Rhode Island and California facilities as well as internationally in our Ireland, Netherlands and Singapore facilities. In addition, we use third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network.\nTo support our clinical trials, we manufacture product candidates primarily at our California facilities. We also use third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our overall clinical manufacturing network.\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products.\nDistribution\nWe operate distribution centers in Puerto Rico, Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide.\nOther\nIn addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, each of our manufacturing locations includes key manufacturing support functions such as quality control, process development, engineering, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as international regulatory agencies. See Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Regulation of Manufacturing Standards.\nManufacturing Initiatives\nAs discussed above, we have been expanding capacity and advancing new innovations with multiple ongoing projects.\nOur next-generation biomanufacturing plant at our West Greenwich, Rhode Island, campus, the first of its kind in the United States, has been approved by the FDA and EMA. This plant expands our capacity to manufacture certain products for U.S. and global markets, as we receive regulatory approval in those markets.\nIn November 2021, we broke ground for our newest biomanufacturing plant located in New Albany, Ohio. This final product assembly and packaging plant will support the growing demand for Amgen\u2019s medicines in the United States and will use state-of-the-art technologies.\nIn March 2022, we broke ground for our new multi-product drug substance manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina. The new plant will support both traditional stainless steel-fed batch manufacturing and next-generation single-use technologies, allowing flexibility in the production of multiple products in one plant.\nAmgen continues to embed environmental sustainability into the upfront design, development and execution of our new facilities. The new facilities under construction in North Carolina and Ohio contain many examples of environmental advances, including on-site photovoltaic renewable energy generation at both sites. We expect our North Carolina facility\u2019s carbon, waste and water footprints to be substantially lower than those at a traditional drug substance manufacturing plant, and we expect lower footprints per unit produced as well at our Ohio facility compared with existing similar facilities.\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors-Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\nRaw Materials and Medical Devices\nCertain raw materials, medical devices (including companion diagnostics) and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by means of inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\nWe perform various procedures to help authenticate the sources of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products; the procedures include verification of country of origin and are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform.\nTo better ensure supply, Amgen has a risk mitigation strategy that uses a combination of methods, including multiple sources or backup inventory of critical raw materials. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of our ongoing business continuity efforts, we continue to closely monitor our inventory levels and have taken additional measures to mitigate against raw material supply interruption. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nRegulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. To clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex, and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of factors, including global regulatory implications, that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products.\nRegulation in the United States\nIn the United States, the Public Health Service Act; the FDCA; and the regulations promulgated thereunder as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products in addition to the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals.\nClinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky, and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very long-approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk-benefit profile. We continue to work toward reducing cycle times by applying our expertise in human genetics and innovation in technology, clinical trials and real-world evidence.\nAfter laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an IND with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program.\n\u2022In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects.\n\u2022In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side-effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a patient population larger than phase 1 but still relatively small, who have the disease or condition under study.\n\u2022In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of our product candidates, compared to commonly used treatments, in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.\nThe FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on data accumulated to that point and the FDA\u2019s risk-benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of either a Biologics License Application for biologic products or a New Drug Application for small molecule products. We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application.\nApproval of Biosimilars. The Affordable Care Act authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical-trial and clinical-trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be \u201chighly similar\u201d and to have no clinically meaningful differences with regard to safety, purity and potency. The relevance of demonstrating \u201csimilarity\u201d is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, because risk-benefit has previously been established. To preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators\u2019 products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator\u2019s data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. As part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, the FDA released a number of guidance documents, some of which remain in draft form. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.\nRegulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products. Our product promotions for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDA\u2019s implemented regulations and guidance. The FDA\u2019s review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses but is not limited to direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare-provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of the FDA\u2019s advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws.\nRegulation of Manufacturing Standards. The FDA regulates and inspects the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to granting approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to reinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval.\nRegulation of Combination Products. Combination products are defined by the FDA as products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well.\nRegulation outside the United States\nIn EU countries as well as in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States.\nIn the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessment-based on safety, quality and efficacy-is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single Marketing Authorisation Application to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA\u2019s CHMP adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization. Even though the EC generally follows the CHMP\u2019s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval.\nIn the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, an applicant seeks and obtains regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired, relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is \u201chighly similar\u201d with regard to quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.\nOther countries such as those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements.\nIn Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical-trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, regulatory timelines can be less predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more-mature systems that would allow for submissions under more-competitive time frames. With regard to biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., Australia, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea).\nIn some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby manufacturers must establish that their medical devices conform to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements.\nPostapproval Phase\nAfter approval, we continue to monitor adverse events and product complaints reported following the use of our products through routine postmarketing surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required by local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure the implementation of signal detection, assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We also proactively monitor product complaints through our quality systems, which includes assessing our drug delivery devices for device complaints, adverse events and malfunctions. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Health regulators, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product\u2019s life cycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products.\nHealth regulators, including the FDA, also have authority both before and after approval to require that a company implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, such a risk management program is known as a REMS, and we currently have REMSs for Prolia, Nplate and BLINCYTO.\nOther Regulation\nWe are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including antikickback laws and false-claims laws. Antikickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescribing of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False-claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under false-claims laws may also arise when violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying product (e.g., a violation regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim.\nOn April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations related to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access medicines. Additionally, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement that requires us to both maintain a corporate compliance program and undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future, our practices might be further challenged under antikickback or similar laws.\nThe FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA arguably includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws and/or regulations. Failure by our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators to comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws and/or regulations could result in significant civil or criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations globally with regard to privacy and data protection. These laws and regulations involve the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environments regarding privacy and data protection are continually evolving and developing because these issues are subjects of increasing amounts of attention in countries globally. For example, we are subject to the EU\u2019s GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018; the CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020; the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which amended the CCPA and became effective on January 1, 2023; and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law, which became effective on November 1, 2021. Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. For example, Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have all subsequently passed similar consumer privacy laws, which went into effect in Virginia as of January 1, 2023, and will go into effect in Colorado, Utah and Connecticut later in 2023. Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant penalties.\nOur business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and regulations, including provisions of the IRA. See Reimbursement section above.\nResearch and Development and Selected Product Candidates\nWe focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness. We capitalize on our strengths in human genetics, novel biology and protein engineering. We leverage our biologic expertise and seek to choose the optimal modality for a drug target and disease. And we use cutting-edge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases.\nOur discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, other combination modalities or new modalities. We have reshaped our portfolio and have increasingly focused our efforts on human genetics when possible to enhance the likelihood of success.\nSince early 2021, efforts have been under way to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainty remains as to the efficacy of these activities with respect to the ongoing trajectory of the pandemic. Challenges to vaccination efforts, new variants and other causes of virus spread may require governments to change restrictions and/or shutdown requirements in various geographies. As a result, we expect to see continued volatility for at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions. With regard to our clinical trial activities, we are continuously monitoring COVID-19 infection rates, including changes from new variants; we are working to mitigate effects on future study enrollment in our clinical trials; and we are evaluating the impact in all relevant countries. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in their providing care for patients and in our providing investigational drug supply.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our R&D expenses were $4.4 billion, $4.8 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.\nWe have major R&D centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California; Iceland; and the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties.\nOur clinical trial activities are conducted by both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number and diversity of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Clinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors-We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.\nSome of our competitors are actively engaged in R&D in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to a product\u2019s eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position.\nIn addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal R&D efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these R&D arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the R&D.\nThe following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of January 31, 2023, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) The information in this section does not include other, nonregistrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication.\nWe may conduct nonregistrational clinical trials for various reasons, including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with regard to the use of products.\nPhase 3 Clinical trials investigate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of our product candidates, compared to commonly used treatments, in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.\nPhase 2 Clinical trials investigate side-effect profiles and efficacy of product candidates in a larger patient population than phase 1, but still relatively small, who have the disease or condition under study.\nPhase 1 Clinical trials investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of product candidates in a small number of human subjects.\nPhase 3 Product Candidate Program Changes\nAs of February 8, 2022, we had 13 phase 3 programs. As of January 31, 2023, we have 18 phase 3 programs, as five programs initiated phase 3 studies. These changes are set forth in the following table.\nPhase 3 Product Candidate Patent Information\nThe following table describes our composition-of-matter patents that have been issued thus far for our product candidates in phase 3 development that have yet to be approved for any indication in the United States or the EU. Patents for products already approved for one or more indications in the United States or the EU but that are currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trials for additional indications have been previously described. See Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Patents.\n* Patent expiration estimates are based on issued patents, which may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by competitors. The estimates do not include any term adjustments, extensions or supplemental protection certificates that may be obtained in the future and thereby extend these dates. Corresponding patent applications are pending in other jurisdictions. Additional patents may be filed or issued and may provide additional exclusivity for the product candidate or its use.\nPhases 3 and 2 Program Descriptions\nThe following provides additional information about selected product candidates that have advanced into human clinical trials.\nAMJEVITA\nAMJEVITA is a biosimilar to HUMIRA, which is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits binding of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha to cell surface TNF receptor / TNF-alpha.\nBemarituzumab\nBemarituzumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b).

The first randomized clinical trial for a KRASG12C inhibitor assessed the efficacy and safety of LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS in 345 previously treated patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who had received at minimum, prior platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapy.\nIn September 2022, we announced detailed results from the global Phase 3 CodeBreaK 200 trial, which showed once-daily oral LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS led to significantly superior PFS (primary endpoint) and a significantly higher ORR (a key secondary endpoint) in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, compared with intravenous chemotherapy, docetaxel. We also announced updated data from its Phase 1b CodeBreaK 101 study, one of the most comprehensive global clinical development programs in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated colorectal cancer. These data show that combining LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS with Vectibix, Amgen's monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibody, demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety.\nNplate\nNplate is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA). It is being investigated for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT).\nOlpasiran\nOlpasiran is an siRNA that lowers Lp(a).

In addition, we acquire product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product base. These arrangements generally provide for nonrefundable upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalties and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.\nTrade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of a business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.\nBeiGene, Ltd.\nIn January 2020, we acquired an equity stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. For additional information regarding our equity investment in BeiGene, see Part IV-Note 9, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the collaboration, BeiGene began selling XGEVA in 2020, BLINCYTO in 2021 and KYPROLIS in 2022 in China, and Amgen shares profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period.

We strive to serve patients by transforming the promise of science and biotechnology into therapies that have the power to restore health or save lives. The way we approach our business is guided by our Amgen Values:\nOur staff are also guided by the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct, which is designed to help every person who does business on our behalf worldwide (including all staff, management, consultants, contract workers and temporary workers) to understand what is expected of them.\nOur industry exists in a complex regulatory and reimbursement environment. The unique demands of our industry, together with the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of innovative medicines, requires a highly engaged and committed workforce.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Amgen had approximately 25,200 staff members in over 50 countries, and we have had relatively low global turnover rates compared to available industry information. We also supplement our workforce with independent contractors, contingent workers and temporary workers, as needed. Outside of the United States, some of our employees are represented by unions or works councils. We consider our staff relations to be good, supported by regular assessments of staff engagement surveys on a wide range of topics (including flexible work environments, diversity, inclusion and belonging, and maintaining a culture of compliance). We discuss the results of these surveys with our workforce and our Board of Directors. Reflecting our staff members\u2019 desire to retain flexibility to work virtually as COVID-19 related restrictions eased and sites became more accessible, we implemented a flexible workspace initiative that enables many employees to work together with their manager to determine the location that best enables their work at hand, supporting virtual work as well as coming on site.\nCompensation, Benefits and Development\nOur approach to employee compensation and benefits is designed to deliver cash, equity and benefit programs that are competitive with those offered by leading companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and to attract, motivate and retain talent with a focus on encouraging performance, promoting accountability and adherence to Company values and alignment with the interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders.\nOur base pay program aims to compensate staff members relative to the value of the contributions of their role, which takes into account the skills, knowledge and abilities required to perform each position, as well as the experience brought to the job. We also provide annual incentive programs to reward our staff in alignment with achievement of Company-wide goals that are established annually and designed to drive aspects of our strategic priorities that support and advance our strategy across our Company. The majority of our staff members are also eligible for the grant of equity awards under our long-term incentive program that are designed to align the interests of our staff members with those of our shareholders. For senior level staff, a significant proportion of equity award value is based on company performance.\nAll staff also participate in a regular performance measurement process through which staff receive performance and development feedback, and pay is aligned to performance. The Amgen Values and leadership behaviors are an integral part of the performance assessments of our staff members, and these evaluations serve as an important information tool and basis for compensation decisions.\nTo support the development of our staff, we provide a variety of programs, including leadership development programs, classroom-based and virtual instructor-led courses, and self-paced learning options as well as mentoring, networking and coaching opportunities.\nOur benefit programs are also generally broad-based, promote health and overall well-being and emphasize saving for retirement. All regular U.S. staff members are eligible to participate in the same core health and welfare and retirement savings plans. Other U.S. employee benefits include medical plans, dental plans, adoption assistance, paid parental leave programs, access to childcare, employee assistance programs, employee stock purchase plan, flexible spending accounts, life, long-term care and business travel accident insurance, short and long-term disability benefits, wellness benefits and work-life resources and referrals. Comparable programs and benefits are available globally, with the same health and well-being intent, consistent with statutory requirements.\nOur Compensation and Management Development Committee provides oversight of our compensation plans, policies and programs.\nSafety and Wellness and Our Response to the Evolving COVID-19 Pandemic\nCreating a safe and healthy workplace for our staff is an important priority at Amgen. Our goal is to have a world class safety record through safety leadership, risk management practices and integrating safety throughout our business processes. To foster our safety culture, we implement a comprehensive safety program and reinforce desired safety behaviors, driving to understand and mitigate the root cause of safety incidents and manage and control variability. We use leading indicators to assess the effectiveness of our safety programs and make course corrections as needed. Additionally, we perform formal executive management review of functional safety performance for Operations, Global Commercial Operations and R&D on a quarterly basis with a focus on identifying early signals and taking action to drive continuous improvement.\nIn 2022, in response to the evolving requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic, to continue to maintain staff safety while enabling greater flexibility for Amgen sites and enhance efficiencies, we began shifting to a decentralized model for COVID-19 decision-making, empowering our local teams to adjust COVID-19 safety guidance for their individual sites or regions (such as the use of masks and other personal protective equipment, occupancy limits, and temperature check and testing, based on local regulations and risk assessments of local epidemiology criteria). We will continue to learn and adapt this approach as needed for the future.\nOur Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee provides general oversight of our safety programs and initiatives, while our Board of Directors, as a whole, has overseen our specific responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\nWe believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. Further, we also believe our global presence is strengthened by having a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. It is with these beliefs in mind that we have continued to strengthen and grow our culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council is led by our executive leadership and is responsible for overseeing our strategy to further a diverse and inclusive workplace. We offer a variety of diversity, inclusion and belonging training and learning programs and have continued to launch enhanced tools and resources that guide staff on the role they play in creating diversity, inclusion and belonging throughout the organization. Further, we continue to incorporate diversity, inclusion and belonging considerations into our business operations, including clinical trial design, procurement and site selection.\nEach of Amgen\u2019s Employee Resource Groups is sponsored by senior executive leadership. Our Employee Resource Groups promote leadership, development and belonging for members while also working to impact our business by leading business initiatives and providing diverse perspectives and experience. In 2022, Amgen launched its newest global Employee Resource Group called Recognition of Indigenous Peoples, Values and Environmental Resources, or RIVER, to share and continue the traditions, values and culture of Indigenous people.\nBuilding on the successful adoption of our 2021 ESG goal under our annual incentive plan, we are driving leadership ownership and accountability for diversity, inclusion and belonging deeper in the organization with an enhanced ESG goal for 2022 designed to advance our progress on key ESG initiatives, including by expanding the number of leaders accountable for establishing, documenting and executing on diversity, inclusion and belonging action plans.\nAs of December 31, 2022, women comprised over 52% of our global workforce, and ethnic minorities accounted for approximately 52% of our U.S. and Puerto Rico-based workforce. In areas of underrepresentation, we develop plans with a goal of bringing our representation in line with availability. We engage in outreach efforts to attract, retain and advance more women and minorities in our workforce. For example, we have worked to enhance our diverse candidate recruiting pool by developing relationships with organizations that can serve as a source of diverse candidates, such as the National Black MBA Association and Society of Women in Engineering, as well as historically black colleges and universities. In 2021, a fellowship program between Amgen and Howard University was established to expand the talent pool and diversify ranks in research and development.\nAdditionally, we are a founding member of OneTen, a coalition of the world\u2019s largest, best-known companies, that aims to hire one million Black Americans (with a specific focus on those without four-year college degrees) into good-paying, family-sustaining jobs over the next ten years. Amgen is taking a leadership role in the greater Los Angeles region, where the company is headquartered, to help expand the coalition of OneTen organizations that share our desire to offer opportunities to diverse talent, and we developed an in-house apprenticeship program in support of our OneTen commitment. Other examples of actions that we are taking in this area include increased investment and participation in the Healthcare Businesswomen\u2019s Association (a global organization focused on development and business networking for women in healthcare) and the UCLA Anderson School of Management leadership advancement programs for women and underrepresented talent.\nOur 2021 Consolidated EEO-1 Report can be viewed on our website at www.amgen.com (the website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained in our website is not intended to be a part of this filing).\nFor 2022, our Compensation and Management Development Committee oversaw our labor and employment policies, programs and initiatives, including those relating to diversity, inclusion and belonging.\nInformation about Our Executive Officers\nThe executive officers of the Company as of February 9, 2023, are set forth below.\nMr. Robert A.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management\u2019s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.\nSUMMARY\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Operating a Global Business, Including During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations.\n\u2022A breakdown of our information technology systems, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation.\n\u2022Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations and Third-Party Policies\n\u2022Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability.\n\u2022Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.\n\u2022The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\n\u2022Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.\nRisks Related to Competition\n\u2022Our products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition.\n\u2022Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.\n\u2022We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.\n\u2022Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\nRisks Related to Research and Development\n\u2022We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D.\n\u2022We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.\n\u2022Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.\n\u2022Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.\n\u2022Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sales of our products.\n\u2022Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.\nRisks Related to Operations\n\u2022We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.\n\u2022We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\n\u2022Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\n\u2022Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives.\n\u2022The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.\n\u2022Our stock price is volatile.\n\u2022We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nRISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS, INCLUDING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations.\nThe novel coronavirus identified in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, is an ongoing global pandemic that has resulted in public and governmental efforts to contain or slow the spread of the disease, including widespread shelter-in-place orders, social distancing interventions, quarantines, travel restrictions and various forms of operational shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting measures implemented in response to the pandemic are adversely affecting, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, our business (including our R&D, clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development and sales activities), the business activities\nof our suppliers, customers, third-party payers and our patients. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval; see also We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Due to the pandemic and these measures and their effects, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products, exacerbated by COVID-19 surges resulting in repeated shutdowns and/or disruptions in certain geographies.\nFederal, state and local, and international governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 also have resulted in the cancellation or delay of diagnostic, elective, specialty and other procedures and appointments to avoid non-essential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID-19 and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of COVID-19. For example, an NPR/Harvard poll in 2021 found that, with hospitals crowded from COVID-19, one in five U.S. households had to delay care for serious illnesses. These measures and challenges will likely continue to varying degrees and have significantly reduced patient access to, and administration of, certain of our drugs. For example, Prolia requires administration by a healthcare provider in doctors\u2019 offices or other healthcare settings that are affected by COVID-19. The U.S. label for Prolia instructs healthcare professionals who discontinue Prolia to transition the patient to an alternative antiresorptive, including oral treatments that do not require administration by a healthcare provider. Further, as a result of COVID-19, oncology patients, in consultation with their doctors, may be selecting therapies that are less immunosuppressive or therapies that do not require administration in a hospital setting, potentially adversely affecting sales of certain of our products. Also, new patients have been, and are expected to continue to be, less likely to be diagnosed and/or to start therapeutics during the pandemic, and these effects, together with the lower treatment rates during the pandemic, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a cumulative negative effect on the commercial performance of our business. The decrease in diagnoses over the course of the pandemic has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect to continue to impact our business. As COVID-19 infection rates ebb and flow, we anticipate there could be periodic backlogs of patients seeking appointments with physicians relating to a variety of medical conditions, and as a result, patients seeking treatment with certain of our products may have to navigate lower provider capacity, and this lower provider capacity could have a continued adverse effect on our sales. Further, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in long-term shifts in preferences among healthcare professionals and patients toward treatments that do not require administration by healthcare professionals or visits to medical facilities.\nAs the pandemic continues, and if conditions worsen or if the duration of the pandemic extends significantly, we expect to experience additional adverse effects on our development, operational and commercial activities, customer purchases and our collections of accounts receivable. It remains uncertain the degree to which these adverse effects would impact our future operational and commercial activities, customer purchases and our collections as conditions begin to improve. There was a resurgence in COVID-19 infections in numerous jurisdictions in 2022, resulting in the reinstatement of stricter restrictions and shutdowns in a number of jurisdictions, including in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. It is expected that the pandemic will continue to ebb and flow, with different jurisdictions having higher levels of infections than others over the course of the pandemic. New variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have emerged, including the delta and omicron variants and its subvariants, and have been shown to be present in many geographies and appear to spread more easily and quickly than other variants. Further, although some studies suggest that antibodies generated with currently authorized vaccines may be effective against these variants, it remains uncertain whether currently available vaccines will retain their efficacy against future variants of the virus. Further, even while vaccine booster shots are available for certain patients, persistent vaccine hesitancy may result in under-vaccinated populations which may prolong the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to disrupt the availability of healthcare services to the patients we serve. Jurisdictions may implement, continue or reinstate border closures, impose or reimpose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity. These measures could significantly affect our ability to support our operations and customers and the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to discover, study, develop and produce our product candidates and products, disrupt the movement of our products through the supply chain, and further prevent or discourage patients from participating in our clinical trials, seeking healthcare services and the administration of certain of our products. The increased availability of remote working arrangements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. Further, in connection with the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical products, we or our suppliers may elect to, or governments may require us or our suppliers to, allocate manufacturing capacity (for example pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act) in a way that adversely affects our regular operations, customer relationships and financial results. In the United States, on January 21, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order instructing federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to improve current and future pandemic response and biological threat preparedness. The rapid reallocation of resources for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 (including the production of COVID-19 vaccines or related therapies, such as our agreement to contribute to the production of COVID-19 antibody therapies for Lilly) and/or disruptions and shortages in the global supply chain caused by the pandemic, could also result in increased competition for, or reduced availability of, materials or components used in the development, manufacturing, distribution or administration of our products. For example, during the second quarter of 2021, an industry-wide shortage of certain lab kit supplies necessary for some activities that support our\nclinical trials has developed that we are actively monitoring and managing. We have also experienced challenges in obtaining certain COVID-19-related supplies, including COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits for our staff, as a result of high demand and limited supplies during the omicron variant surge. In addition, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand, which could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from it may precipitate or amplify the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition and results. For example, if a natural disaster or other potentially disruptive event occurs concurrently with the COVID-19 pandemic, such disaster or event could deplete our inventory levels and we could experience a disruption to our manufacturing or ability to supply our products.\nThe rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate effect of COVID-19 on us. The duration of the measures being taken by the authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19 (including the distribution and/or availability of vaccines and boosters), and the extent to which such measures are effective, if at all, remain highly uncertain. The magnitude and degree of COVID-19\u2019s adverse effect on our business (including our product development, product sales, operating results and resulting cash flows) and financial condition will be driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic\u2019s effect on the United States and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state, local and international governmental responses to the pandemic. If mitigation of the pandemic continues to require further shelter-in-place and shutdown orders and/or restrictions on individual and/or group conduct, any adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely grow and could be enduring, and our business and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nA breakdown of our information technology systems, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation.\nTo achieve our business objectives, we rely on sophisticated information technology systems, including software, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or adversely affect our reputation.\nOur information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our R&D efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. Further, as the majority of our employees work remotely for some portion of their jobs in our hybrid work environment, our reliance on our and third-party information technology systems has increased substantially and is expected to continue to increase. The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Upgrades or changes to our systems or the software that we use may result in the introduction of new cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. In 2022 we identified a number of security vulnerabilities introduced into our information systems as a result of flaws that we subsequently identified in software that we purchased and installed, and these flaws required that we apply emergency patches to certain of our systems. While we did not experience any significant adverse effects as a result of these vulnerabilities, there can be no assurance that we will timely identify and address any future vulnerabilities. Our systems are also subject to frequent perimeter network reconnaissance and scanning, phishing and other cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the use of harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, that can be deployed through various means, including the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites and/or the use of social engineering. We have also experienced denial of service attacks against our network, and although such attacks did not succeed, there can be no assurance that our efforts to guard against the wide and growing variety of potential attack techniques will be successful in the future. Attacks such as those experienced by governmental entities (including those that approve and/or regulate our products, such as the EMA) and other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access or protect important data and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and/or distributing our products. For example, in 2017, a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. As a result of the cyberattack, its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively affected. In late 2020, SolarWinds Corporation, a leading provider of software for monitoring and managing information technology infrastructure, disclosed that it had suffered a cybersecurity incident whereby attackers had inserted malicious code into legitimate software updates for its products that were installed by myriad private and government customers, enabling the attackers to access a backdoor to such systems. In 2022, Okta, Inc., a provider of software that helps companies manage user authentication, disclosed that several hundred of its corporate customers were vulnerable to a security breach that allowed\nattackers to access Okta\u2019s internal network. Although this breach did not have a significant effect on our business, there can be no assurance that a similar future breach would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials and/or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other parties. In some cases, we utilize third-party service providers to process, store, manage or transmit such data, which may increase our risk. Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) resulting from attacks or lapses by employees, service providers (including providers of information technology-specific services), business partners, nation states (including groups associated with or supported by foreign intelligence agencies), organized crime organizations, \u201chacktivists\u201d or others, create risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors or the public. System vulnerabilities and/or cybersecurity breaches experienced by our third-party service providers have constituted a substantial share of the information security risks that have affected us. For example, in the first half of 2021, a supplier experienced a data breach in which an unauthorized third party acquired access to certain information provided to the supplier in the course of its provision of services to us, including business documents and certain personally identifiable patient information (not including social security or other financial or health insurance information). As required, we promptly notified the applicable state attorneys general and the individuals whose personally identifiable information was affected of this data breach at the supplier. In the third quarter of 2022, another service provider experienced a similar cybersecurity breach in which an attacker exfiltrated certain data (including non-significant Amgen data) from the service provider\u2019s systems. Although these supplier data breaches have not resulted in material adverse effects on our business, there can be no assurance that a similar future cybersecurity incident would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Further, the timeliness of our awareness of a cybersecurity incident affects our ability to respond to and work to mitigate the severity of such events. For example, in 2020 and 2022, two of our vendors experienced cyberattacks and each initially reported to us that neither event involved our data. However, upon further investigation, they each subsequently informed us that the attackers had accessed limited, non-significant Amgen information. Although neither of these breaches had a significant adverse effect on our business, in the future we may again not receive timely reporting of cybersecurity events and such events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCyberattackers are also increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities in commercially available software from shared or open-source code. We rely on third party commercial software that may have such vulnerabilities, but as use of open-source code is frequently not disclosed, our ability to fully assess this risk to our systems is limited. For example, in December 2021, a remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in a widely used software library that is used in a variety of commercially available software and services. Although this vulnerability has not resulted in any significant adverse effects on us, there can be no assurances that a similar future vulnerability in the software and services that we use would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nDomestic and global government regulators, our business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners with business services and companies we have acquired or may acquire face similar risks, and security breaches of their systems or service outages could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data or sensitive personal information. For example, in 2019, two vendors that perform testing and analytical services that we use in developing and manufacturing our products experienced cyberattacks, and in April and September of 2020, vendors that provide us with information technology services and clinical data services, respectively, each experienced ransomware attacks. Although there was no breach of our systems, each of these incidents required us to disconnect our systems from those vendors\u2019 systems. While we were able to reconnect our systems following restoration of these vendors\u2019 capabilities without significantly affecting product availability, a more extended service outage affecting these or other vendors, particularly where such vendor is the single source from which we obtain the services, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers and patients.\nAlthough we have experienced system breakdowns, attacks and information security breaches, we do not believe such breakdowns, attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems. However, there can be no assurances that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks and/or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss or exposure of critical, proprietary, private, confidential or otherwise sensitive data, which could result in material financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or negatively affect our stock price. While we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data.\nWe are also subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection, including laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and developing and the subject of significant attention globally. For example, we are subject to the EU\u2019s GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, and the CCPA, which became effective in January 2020, both of which provide for substantial penalties for noncompliance. The CCPA was amended in late 2020, to create the California Privacy Rights Act to create opt in requirements for the use of sensitive personal data and the formation of a new dedicated agency for the enforcement of the law, the California Privacy Protection Agency. Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have all subsequently passed similar consumer privacy laws, which went into effect in Virginia as of January 1, 2023, and will go into effect in Colorado, Utah and Connecticut later in 2023. Other jurisdictions where we operate have passed, or continue to propose, similar legislation and/or regulations. For example, in China, the Personal Information Protection Law and the Data Security Law, which regulate data processing activities associated with personal and nonpersonal data, are in effect and build upon the existing Cybersecurity Law. Failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.\nAs we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction, both independently and through collaborations such as our collaboration with BeiGene, of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Our international business, including in China and emerging market countries, may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including issues of geopolitical relations, the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions and/or sovereign debt issues. Further, in 2022 and continuing through early 2023, the Asia Pacific region also experienced a surge of COVID-19 infections. While one country in the region initially responded to the surge by activating strict containment measures, in late 2022 that country abruptly reversed those measures, resulting in a significant COVID-19 outbreak, causing issues such as lack of capacity at hospitals that could lead to a local health emergencies. If relations between the United States and other governments deteriorate, our business and investments in such markets may also be adversely affected. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements including those previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Our expansion efforts in China and emerging markets around the world are dependent upon the establishment of an environment that is predictable, navigable and supportive of biopharmaceutical innovation, sustained access for our products and predictable pricing controls. For example, China continues to strengthen regulations on the collection, use and transmission of Chinese human genetic resources, and has expanded regulations on the conduct of biotechnology R&D activities in China. Between 2020 and 2022, we experienced delays in our applications to the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China that sought approval to conduct clinical trials in China. Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition, far-reaching antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments.\nIn response to the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine, the U.S. government, numerous state governments, the EU and other countries in which we conduct business have imposed a wide range of economic sanctions that restrict commerce and business dealings with Russia, certain regions of Ukraine and certain entities and individuals. This conflict may also precipitate or amplify the other risks described herein, including risks relating to cybersecurity, global economic conditions, clinical trials and supply chains, which could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition and results.\nAs we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. Overall, the legal and operational challenges of our international business operations, along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products, may result in material adverse effects on our international product sales, business and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THIRD-PARTY POLICIES\nOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability.\nSales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug utilization and contain costs. Further, pressures on healthcare budgets from the pandemic, the economic downturn and inflation continue and are likely to increase across the markets we serve. Payers are increasingly focused on costs, which have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for which payers will reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, have limited, and are likely to continue to limit, our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which can have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, particularly over the past few years, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced and/or signed into law that attempt to lower drug prices. These include legislation promulgated by the IRA that enables the U.S. government to set prices for certain drugs in Medicare, redesigns Medicare Part D benefits to shift a greater portion of the costs to manufacturers and enables the U.S. government to impose penalties if drug prices are increased at a rate faster than inflation. Additional proposals focused on drug pricing continue to be debated, and additional executive orders focused on drug pricing and competition are likely to be adopted and implemented in some form. Government actions or ballot initiatives at the state level also represent a highly active area of policymaking and experimentation, including pursuit of proposals that limit drug reimbursement under state run Medicaid programs based on reference prices or permitting importation of drugs from Canada. Such state policies may also eventually be adopted at the federal level.\nWe are unable to predict which or how many policy, regulatory, administrative or legislative changes may ultimately be, or effectively estimate the consequences to our business if, enacted and implemented. However, to the extent that payer actions further decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or affect our decisions regarding the pricing of or otherwise reduce the use of our products, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n-Changing U.S. federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected and are likely to continue to affect access to, pricing of and sales of our products\nA substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Reimbursement. Our business has been and will continue to be affected by legislative actions changing U.S. federal reimbursement policy. For example, in August 2022, the IRA was enacted and includes provisions requiring that: (1) beginning in 2026, mandatory price setting be introduced in Medicare for certain drugs paid for under Parts B and D, whereby manufacturers must accept a price established by the government or face penalties on all U.S. sales (starting with 10 drugs in 2026, adding 15 in 2027 and 2028, and adding 20 in 2029 and subsequent years such that by 2031 approximately 100 drugs could be subject to such set prices); (2) starting in 2024, Medicare Part D be redesigned to cap beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and, beginning January 1, 2025, Federal reinsurance be reduced in the catastrophic phase (resulting in a shift and increase of such costs to Part D plans and manufacturers, including by requiring manufacturer discounts on certain drugs); and (3) beginning October 1, 2022, manufacturers will owe rebates on drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part D if price increases outpace inflation, and beginning January 1, 2023, will owe rebates on drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part B if price increases outpace inflation. The IRA\u2019s drug pricing controls and Medicare redesign is likely to have a material adverse effect on our sales (particularly for our products that are more substantially reliant on Medicare reimbursement), our business and our results of operations. However, as the degree of impact from this legislation on our business depends on a number of implementation decisions, the extent of the IRA\u2019s impact on our sales and, in turn, our business remains unclear. Further, following the passage of the IRA, the environment remains dynamic, and in October 2022, the Administration issued an Executive Order on Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans that calls for the HHS to issue a report within 90 days on Innovation Center models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. This Executive Order follows a 2021 Executive Order that included a timeline designed to increase competition in the healthcare sector, including by calling for the FDA to develop prescription drug importation programs and the FTC to apply greater scrutiny of anticompetitive activity. Responses to this order, including by the HHS, which released a report with drug pricing proposals that seek to promote competition, and by the USPTO, which has taken steps to strengthen coordination with the FDA to address impediments to generic drug and biosimilar competition. CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can also significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. In September 2021, HHS released a plan to address drug pricing that included potential future mandatory models that link payment for prescription drugs and biologics to certain factors, including the overall cost of care.\nWe also face risks related to the reporting of pricing data that affects reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.\n-Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect access to and have affected and may continue to affect sales of our products\nAt the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, drug importation programs or other pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to report to the state proprietary pricing information or provide advance notice of certain price increases. For example, a California law requires biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. Similar laws exist in Oregon and Washington. Additional proposals directed at Medicaid seek to penalize manufacturers for pricing drugs above a certain threshold or limit spending on biopharmaceutical products. States are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs. New York has established a Medicaid drug spending cap, and Massachusetts implemented a new review and supplemental rebate negotiation process. Six states (Colorado, Maine, New Hampshire, Maryland, Oregon and Washington) have enacted laws that establish Prescription Drug Affordability Boards (PDABs) to study drug prices and identify drugs that pose affordability challenges, and in three states (Colorado, Maryland and Washington) include authority for the state PDAB to set upper payment limits on certain drugs in state regulated plans. Other states may consider implementing similar policies and laws. Additionally, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Vermont have enacted laws, and several other states have proposed bills, to implement importation of drugs from Canada. The FDA has met with representatives from Colorado, Florida, Maine and New Mexico to discuss those states\u2019 proposed importation programs, and the FDA may be working towards approving such plans. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs. Ultimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\n-U.S. commercial payer actions have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our products\nPayers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from consolidations of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients\u2019 use of manufacturer commercial co-pay assistance programs. Further, government regulation of payers may affect these trends. For example, CMS finalized a policy for plan years starting on or after January 1, 2021 that has caused commercial payers to more widely adopt co-pay accumulator adjustment programs. Payers, including PBMs, have sought, and continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, and to also impose restrictions on access to or usage of our products (such as Step Therapy), require that patients receive the payer\u2019s prior authorization before covering the product, and/or chosen to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha has been prescribed meet their utilization criteria, and these requirements have served to limit and may continue to limit patient access to Repatha treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers (including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans), and in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha prescriptions rather than paying their co-pay, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha available at a lower list price. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has limited and may continue to limit patient use. Further, despite these net and list price reductions, some payers have restricted, and may continue to restrict, patient access and may seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions, such as changing formulary coverage for Repatha, that could reduce our sales of Repatha. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, negatively affecting Repatha sales.\nFurther, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in the United States, as of the beginning of 2023, the top five integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 92% of all pharmacy prescriptions. This high degree of\nconsolidation among insurers and PBMs and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers from our business. Each of CVS, Express Scripts and United Health Group (among the top five integrated health plans and PBMs), each have Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their leverage to negotiate deeper discounts. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage changes, plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Policy reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the U.S. marketplace could have downstream implications or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. For example, on June 7, 2022, the FTC launched an inquiry into the business practices of PBMs, and the results of such inquiry could have an effect on manufacturer interactions with PBMs, resulting in changes to access for certain medicines. See our -Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\nOur business is also affected by policies implemented by private healthcare entities that process Medicare claims, including Medicare Administrative Contractors. For example, in the second quarter of 2022, several Medicare Administrative Contractors issued notice, in contravention of TEZSPIRE\u2019s FDA approved labeling, that TEZSPIRE would be added to their \u201cself-administered drug\u201d exclusion lists. Although the Medicare Administrative Contractors subsequently removed TEZSPIRE from their exclusion lists, these exclusions, if reintroduced and/or implemented, would result in Medicare beneficiaries with severe asthma losing access to TEZSPIRE coverage under Medicare Part B and potentially also under Medicare Advantage.\n-Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our products\nOutside the United States, we expect countries will also continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Reimbursement. Pressures to decrease drug expenditures may further intensify as the COVID-19 pandemic has strained government budgets and as economic conditions continue to worsen in certain regions, including in Europe where high inflation and the energy crisis relating to the Russia-Ukraine conflict are challenging the economies in that region. International reference pricing has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product\u2019s price in other countries. International reference pricing policies can change quickly and frequently and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures or affordability differences across countries or regions. Other expenditure control practices, including but not limited to the use of revenue clawbacks, rebates and percentage caps on price increases, are used in various foreign jurisdictions as well. In addition, countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA\u2019s approval of Repatha for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, prior to 2020, the reimbursement of Repatha in France was limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)) following a national health technology assessment. Many countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region. Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products, a deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers has negatively affected, and may further negatively affect, the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients and otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we realize for them. Such changes have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.\nGovernment agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. Professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians\u2019 groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. In addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products\u2019 reimbursement by government and private payers. Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations. In addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service effects of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such health technology assessment organizations have\nrecommended, and may in the future recommend, reimbursement for certain of our products for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax.\nOne or more of our legal entities file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in those jurisdictions. Significant disputes can and have arisen with tax authorities involving issues regarding the timing and amount of deductions, the use of tax credits and allocations of income and expenses among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws, regulations and relevant facts, and such tax authorities (including the IRS) are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on such matters. In 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010-2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010-2012 that we received in May and July 2021 which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010-2012.\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013-2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010-2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013-2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013-2015 and asserts penalties.\nWe firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices through the judicial process. The cases were consolidated on December 19, 2022.\nWe are currently also under examination by the IRS for the years 2016-2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.\nFinal resolution of these complex tax matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nSee Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations, Income Taxes, and Part IV-Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. The 2017 Tax Act is complex and a large volume of regulations and guidance has been issued and could be subject to different interpretations. We could face audit challenges to our application of the 2017 Tax Act. In addition, there are several upcoming provisions in the 2017 Tax Act, including increases in the tax rates on foreign earnings and export income scheduled to take effect at the end of 2025, that could result in an increase in our effective tax rate.\nThe Administration and Congress continue to discuss changes to existing tax law that could substantially increase the taxes we pay in the United States. Further, the OECD reached an agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. Some individual countries, including those in the EU, have proposed\nlegislation to implement the global minimum tax agreement. In other countries such as the United States, however, the implementation of the OECD agreement remains highly uncertain. If enacted, either by all OECD participants or unilaterally by individual countries, the agreement could result in tax increases or double taxation that could affect our United States or foreign tax liabilities. Changes to existing tax law in the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico or other jurisdictions, including the changes and potential changes discussed above, could result in tax increases where we do business and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nOur business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.\nWe are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar antibribery or anticorruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We cannot ensure that all our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations relating to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. As a result, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and potential exclusion from government healthcare programs. We may also see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. For example, prosecutors are placing greater scrutiny on patient support programs, including commercial copay assistance programs, and further enforcement actions and investigations regarding such programs could limit our ability to provide co-pay assistance to commercial patients. Greater scrutiny has also been placed on sponsorships, speaker programs and other arrangements where healthcare professionals receive remuneration, travel or other value to participate in certain events, and further enforcement actions could limit our ability to participate in such arrangements. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION\nOur products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. We expect that our products and product candidates will compete with existing drugs, new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products have expanded into, and are expected to continue expanding into, the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. With the proliferation of companies pursuing biopharmaceuticals, several of our biosimilar products have entered, and a number of our product candidates may enter, markets with one or more competitors or with competitors soon to arrive. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products have been competing and may continue to compete, and our product candidates may compete, against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive\nfeatures. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce our sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Driven by cost pressures, efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses, march-in rights or other governmental interventions, both in the United States and internationally, related to the procurement of drugs, and the World Trade Organization has agreed to a waiver of COVID-19 vaccine intellectual property protections through the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights waiver process. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included, and may in the future include, litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the BPCIA. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation has not discouraged, and may not in the future discourage, a potential violator from bringing the allegedly infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nFurther, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the BPCIA. In addition, we have faced, and may in the future face, patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies, including those that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products or who are developing or have developed other biosimilar versions of such products. Alternatively, patents held by other entities have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies. While we have attempted, and expect to continue to attempt, to challenge the patents held by other companies, our efforts may be unsuccessful. For examples of and information related to our patent litigation, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain of the existing patents on our products have expired or will soon expire. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Patents. As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors have been, and may continue to be, able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products.\nWe currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.\nWe currently face competition from biosimilars and generics in most of the territories in which we operate, including the United States and Europe, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period has accelerated such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products have also experienced greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive regulatory approval standards and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate.\nIn the EU, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries and some Canadian provinces have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, biosimilar uptake measures such as physician prescribing quotas or automatic pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. In September 2022, the EMA and the EU Heads of Medicines\u2019 Agencies (HMA) issued a joint statement providing that biosimilar medicines approved in the EU are \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with their reference products and other biosimilars of the same reference product. This EMA-HMA statement could further contribute to the prescribing of biosimilars and to greater competition in Europe. While the degree of competitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products, in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing.\nIn the United States, the BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Approval of Biosimilars. In the United States, the FDA has approved numerous biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of Neulasta, EPOGEN and ENBREL, and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. For example, six biosimilar versions of Neulasta are now approved in the United States, and we expect that other biosimilar versions of Neulasta may be marketed or receive approval in the future. Impact to our Neulasta sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to compete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing or a broader portfolio of other products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For examples of and information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.\nThe U.S. biosimilar pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain interchangeable status from the FDA, which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products without prior approval from the prescriber in most states under state law. The FDA approved the first interchangeable biosimilar in 2021 and has subsequently granted interchangeability designations to three additional biosimilars. In 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. This has opened the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products. For example, in August 2022, the FDA designated a monoclonal antibody biosimilar as interchangeable without requiring a switching study to support the interchangeability determination. Further, in September 2022, the FDA indicated that while comparative clinical trials will continue to be a requirement for many biosimilar development programs, the agency is focused on reducing the need for them in the future through a range of statistical, analytical and pharmacologic approaches.\nIn addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law\u2019s provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. In 2019, the Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product\u2019s original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as \u201cumbrella exclusivity\u201d). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period,\nthis could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and pass new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDA\u2019s Orange and Purple Books. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two agencies, offered training to help identify prior art, and seeking USPTO\u2019s views on practices that extend market exclusivities, whether pharmaceutical patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board on drug patents. The USPTO responded in July 2022 with a letter to the FDA stating that it is prepared to create formal mechanisms to collaborate with the FDA on patent issues that may affect the timing of generic and biosimilar entry. In January 2023, the USPTO held a joint listening session with the FDA on USPTO-FDA collaboration efforts.\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product (and existing patents for a small molecule product) by an additional six months.\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first state to have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against \u201cpay for delay\u201d settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive. The law may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level.\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. The three largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.\nRISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D.\nAmgen invests heavily in R&D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&D projects yield approved and commercially viable products. Product candidates, including biosimilar product candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development have failed to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:\n\u2022the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it achieved its primary endpoints and/or demonstrated positive preclinical or early clinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine or expectations of health authorities;\n\u2022the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available or potentially competitive therapies in treating a specified condition or illness;\n\u2022the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing or potentially competitive therapeutics;\n\u2022the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans;\n\u2022the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use;\n\u2022reimbursement for the product candidate is limited despite regulatory approval;\n\u2022the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize;\n\u2022other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022we and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities;\n\u2022the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined;\n\u2022the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; and\n\u2022a companion diagnostic device that is required with the use of a product candidate is not approved by the necessary regulatory authority.\nWe have spent considerable time, energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics and acquiring access to libraries of genetic information with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our R&D decisions and investments. We have focused our R&D strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence. However, product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including the factors listed above.\nWe must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.\nBefore a product may be sold, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and/or patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in\nplanned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels.\nFurther, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened, and will continue to open, clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. For other examples of the risks of conducting clinical trials in China, see also Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. Additionally, regional disruptions, including natural and man-made disasters, health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19), or geopolitical conflicts (such as the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine) have significantly disrupted the timing of clinical trials, and in the future could disrupt the timing, execution and outcome of clinical trials. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, or such sites experience disruptions as a result of a natural/man-made disaster, health emergency or geopolitical conflict, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. For example, our clinical trials have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening or monitoring patients in our clinical trials. See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sales of our products. We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. In addition, delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products\u2019 or product candidates\u2019 relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively affect the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively affected. As a result, such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide.\nClinical trials must generally be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In some cases, we may design a clinical trial based on the standard of care we anticipate will exist at the time our study is completed. The duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer or that have not become the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. Additionally, the views of regulatory agencies relating to the requirements for accelerated approval may change over time, and trial designs that were sufficient to support accelerated approvals for some oncology products may not be considered sufficient\nfor later candidates. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval.\nEven after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense, and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations.\nOur current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in the other regions and countries in which we, or our partners and affiliates, sell to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDA\u2019s or ex-U.S. regulatory authorities\u2019 refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets. We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Further, we are reliant on regulators having the resources necessary to evaluate and approve our products. In the United States, a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019. A subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDA\u2019s activities, including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals.\nRegulatory authorities have questioned, and may in the future question, the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD), or to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by PFS. Demonstrating that the product candidate induces MRD-negative responses or produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the CV setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as an elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for CV events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha to prevent CV events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha to reduce the risk of certain CV events. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or at all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels.\nSome of our products have been approved by U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in May 2021, we announced that the FDA approved LUMAKRAS under accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated local advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials, including a requirement by the FDA that we complete a post-marketing trial to investigate whether a lower dose will have a similar clinical effect to the results demonstrated in our pre-marketing trial. We have since received the data from such post-marketing trial and intend to submit it to the FDA, as required. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators\u2019 requirements that were conditions of a product\u2019s accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators reevaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product\u2019s labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market.\nRegulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product\u2019s marketing authorization.\nSafety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to help ensure that a drug\u2019s benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product\u2019s approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:\n\u2022revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;\n\u2022requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;\n\u2022post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;\n\u2022product recalls of our approved products;\n\u2022required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing;\n\u2022revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;\n\u2022increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or\n\u2022treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies.\nFor example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated CV serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials for EVENITY but not in another, larger phase 3 study, in April 2019 the FDA approved EVENITY for the\ntreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial.\nIn addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the BPCIA provided for such a pathway. Discussions within the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and between regulatory authorities and sponsors, continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways, or changes in existing regulatory pathways, including degradation of regulatory standards, could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict the extent to which any potential legislative or policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure \u201cfirst-to-market\u201d or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSome of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.\nMany of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta is available as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, and our AutoTouch reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates and products, including LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS and bemarituzumab, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development or approval of such devices is delayed, such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop, modify, or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017, the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it was evaluating our Neulasta Onpro kit. Subsequently, we implemented device and labeling enhancements to address product complaints received on this device. We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products.\nSome of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sales of our products.\nWe depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. Business-Business Relationships.\nFailures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&D and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.\nOur efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.\nWe seek innovation through significant investment in both internal R&D and external transactions, including collaborations, partnerships, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (collectively, acquisition activity). Acquisition activities may be subject to regulatory approvals or other requirements that are not within our control. There can be no assurance that such regulatory or other approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions required in connection with our acquisition activities will be satisfied or waived, which could result in us being unable to complete the planned acquisition activities. In addition, antitrust scrutiny by regulatory agencies and changes to regulatory approval process in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated to obtain, not be obtained at all, or contain burdensome conditions, which may jeopardize, delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of acquisitions to us and could impede the execution of our business strategy.\nAcquisition activities are complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may divert our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities and restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of such transactions within the expected timeframe or at all. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Further, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses, products or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution and general business operations and procedures and ESG activities) may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the transaction and grow our business and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. These and other challenges may arise in connection with our acquisitions of Otezla, Five Prime, Teneobio, ChemoCentryx, Horizon and/or our collaborations with BeiGene and KKC, or with other acquisition activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS\nWe perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.\nThe global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\nWe currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Thousand Oaks manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.\nIn addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by a number of natural disasters, including Hurricane Maria (2017), earthquakes (2020) and Hurricane Fiona (2022). These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico\u2019s electric grid and communications networks. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility relied on backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. In 2021, the baseload power generation units of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority malfunctioned due to the\nlack of adequate maintenance for over a decade, leading to selective outages across the island. In September 2022, Hurricane Fiona caused further damage to the island\u2019s utility infrastructure which again resulted in widespread power outages and water supply issues. Although these events did not directly have a material effect on our business, they have resulted in disruptions to our third-party suppliers on the island. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase our use of our generators or to use them exclusively. In addition, future storms, earthquakes or other natural or man-made disasters or events (including political unrest or labor shortages) could have a more significant effect on our manufacturing operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in disruptions to activities on the island. In March 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Orders requiring the lockdown of businesses and government facilities, imposing restrictions on business operations and a curfew on residents in response to COVID-19. Additionally, during the summer of 2021, a labor dispute arose between the maritime terminal operation company and its employees, represented by the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA), which resulted in a strike that delayed cargo movement from the San Juan Port Zone for several days. Hurricanes Maria and Fiona, the 2020 earthquakes, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ILA strike have also placed greater stress on the island\u2019s already challenged economy. Beginning in 2016, the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion of debt. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, which established a financial oversight board for Puerto Rico. After years of negotiations with bondholders and other creditors, this financial oversight board reached an agreement with the same, which was confirmed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico effective March 2022. Although our ability to manufacture and supply our products has not, to date, been significantly affected by natural disasters, unreliable electric utility services, strikes, pandemic lockdowns or the island\u2019s economic challenges, these, or a combination of these challenges, or other issues that create a substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location, could make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico, and could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\nWe rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, we rely on a single source for the SureClick autoinjectors used in the drug delivery of Repatha, ENBREL, Aimovig, AMGEVITA and Aranesp. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.\nAmong the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:\n\u2022regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;\n\u2022adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;\n\u2022unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;\n\u2022failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;\n\u2022a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials;\n\u2022discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components;\n\u2022cyberattacks on supplier systems;\n\u2022natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;\n\u2022labor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) or natural disasters; and\n\u2022geopolitical conflicts.\nFor example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility, and we have also experienced shortages related to single use systems and packaging which has caused disruptions to our manufacturing plans. Further quality issues that result in\nunexpected additional demand for certain components have resulted in shortages and in the future may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nManufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\nManufacturing biologic and small molecule human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. Business-Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials-Manufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be affected by:\n\u2022capacity of manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;\n\u2022natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;\n\u2022labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) or natural disasters;\n\u2022compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022changes in forecasts of future demand;\n\u2022timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;\n\u2022updates of manufacturing specifications;\n\u2022contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;\n\u2022timing and outcome of product quality testing;\n\u2022power failures and/or other utility failures;\n\u2022cyberattacks on supplier systems;\n\u2022breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment (including our information technology systems and network-connected control systems or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers);\n\u2022delays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews, inspections and approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended U.S. federal or other government shutdowns; and/or\n\u2022geopolitical conflicts.\nIf any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our third-party contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials, we may be unable to start or increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time, we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot, and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on some product vials. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes, those of our third-party contract manufacturers and those of certain of our third-party service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant, and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider. If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements, new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons, this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes. Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to timely implement such changes, or at all.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our third-party contract manufacturers and service providers. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations, they may mandate corrective actions and/or issue warning letters, or even restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, prohibiting us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. See also Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which has been negatively affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and may be negatively affected by natural disasters or geopolitical security threats.\nThere have also been legislative and administrative proposals seeking to incentivize greater drug manufacturing in the United States with the stated goal of improving supply reliability in the United States. For example, on August 6, 2020, the previous Administration issued an Executive Order aimed at boosting domestic production of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs titled \u201cExecutive Order on Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs are Made in the United States.\u201d Additionally, one legislative proposal would have prohibited the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from purchasing certain drugs that have active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured outside the United States. While we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities in the United States, including in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California, the passage of such legislation could result in foreign governments enacting retaliatory legislation or regulatory actions, which may have an adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nOur business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives.\nWe continue to work towards operating our business in an environmentally responsible and socially inclusive manner. Stakeholders, including our investors and our employees, have increasingly focused on, and are expected to continue to focus on, our ESG practices. If our ESG practices fail to meet these stakeholders\u2019 expectations and standards, there could be a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and, ultimately, our stock price.\nOur ESG report is made available on our website and describes our ESG goals and the progress we have made on the ESG issues deemed most important to our external and internal stakeholders, based on surveys, interviews and certain frameworks for corporate responsibility. Achieving our ESG goals requires long-term investments and broad, coordinated activity, and we may be required to incur additional costs or allocate additional resources towards monitoring, reporting and implementing our ESG practices. Further, we may fail to accurately assess our stakeholders\u2019 ESG priorities, as such priorities have evolved and will continue to evolve. While we have achieved most of our goals set in prior years, whether we can achieve our current and future ESG goals continues to be uncertain and remains subject to numerous risks, including evolving regulatory requirements and social expectations affecting ESG practices, our ability to recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce, the availability of suppliers and collaboration partners that can meet our ESG goals, the effects of the organic growth of our business and potential\nacquisitions of other businesses on our ESG performance, and the availability and cost of technologies or resources, such as carbon credits, that support our goals. For example, impacts on the commodity market and supply chains caused by the armed conflict in Ukraine could limit the availability of electric vehicle components, impairing our ability to meet some of our environmental sustainability goals. Any failure or perceived failure to meet our ESG program priorities could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and stock price.\nThe effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations.\nMany of our operations and facilities, including those essential to our manufacturing, R&D and distribution activities, are in locations that are subject to natural disasters, including droughts, fires, extreme temperatures, hurricanes, tropical storms and/or floods. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Maria caused catastrophic damage, compounded in 2022 by Hurricane Fiona, to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities. Although our site was well-protected and suffered minimal damage, there can be no assurances that we would have similar results in the face of future natural disasters. The severity and frequency of weather-related natural disasters has been amplified, and is expected to continue to be amplified by, global climate change. Such natural disasters have caused, and in the future may cause, damage to and/or disrupt our operations, which may result in a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our suppliers, vendors and business partners also face similar risks, and any disruption to their operations could have an adverse effect on our supply and manufacturing chain. Further, many of our key facilities are located on islands, including Puerto Rico, Singapore and Ireland, which rely on essential port facilities that may be vulnerable to climate change-related or other natural disasters. Although we have detailed business continuity plans in place and periodic assessments of our natural disaster risk, any natural disaster may also result in prolonged interruption to our critical operational and business activities, and we may be required to incur significant costs to remedy the effects of such natural disasters and fully resume operations, which may result in a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. See We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials and Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.\nOur operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. The economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a global recession, and together with high rates of inflation and energy supply issues experienced in certain regions, have led to regional and/or global macroeconomic challenges, the effects of which may be of an extended duration. In particular, acute rising energy costs may further adversely affect productivity and economic conditions in Europe. Additionally, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures in healthcare and other settings. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships (including inflation) may also affect patients\u2019 ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. The current inflationary environment related to increased aggregate demand, supply chain constraints and the effects from the armed conflict in Ukraine (including the effects of the sanctions that were implemented in response to the conflict and the resulting impacts on the commodity market and supply chains) have also increased our operating expenses and may continue to affect our operating expenses. Our operational costs, including the cost of energy, materials, labor, distribution and our other operational and facilities costs are subject to market conditions and are being adversely affected by inflationary pressures. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors\u2019, customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant worsening of global economic conditions could precipitate or materially amplify the other risks described herein.\nWe maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. The global spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. We have certain assets, including equity investments, that are exposed to market fluctuations that could, in a sustained\nor recurrent series of market disruptions, result in impairments. The value of our investments may also be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, inflation, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nOur stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions, including via social media channels, of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would negatively affect our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid effect on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially affected.\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nThe capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. For example, early in 2020, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper market and several borrowers were unable to obtain funding at normal rates or maturities, which resulted in a significant increase in draws of corporate credit lines with banks. Similarly, the bond markets experienced extreme volatility in terms of interest rates and credit spreads, with several days without new issuances of corporate bonds. We expect to access the capital markets, from time to time, to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we strategically plan to pursue, including acquisitions (such as our acquisition of Horizon) and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations or our ability to complete business acquisitions. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.",

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world\u2019s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.\nOur principal products are ENBREL, Prolia, Otezla, XGEVA, Aranesp, Nplate, Repatha, KYPROLIS, Neulasta and EVENITY. We also market a number of other products, including MVASI, Vectibix, BLINCYTO, EPOGEN, AMGEVITA, Aimovig, Parsabiv, KANJINTI, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, TEZSPIRE, NEUPOGEN, Sensipar/Mimpara and TAVNEOS. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.\nOur strategy includes integrated activities intended to strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We operate in six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, cardiovascular (CV) disease, nephrology and neuroscience. We conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and general medicine. In 2022, we advanced our innovative pipeline, grew our international business, completed a strategic transaction to augment our marketed product portfolio, announced our intention to acquire Horizon and continued providing uninterrupted supplies of our medicines globally through the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We accomplished these objectives while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation and advancing our ESG efforts.\nIn 2022, we continued to advance our pipeline, initiating phase 3 clinical trials for a number of programs, including LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS for advanced colorectal cancer, olpasiran for CV disease and rocatinlimab for atopic dermatitis. We continued to grow our international business, including achieving key regulatory approvals for TEZSPIRE in the EU and Japan. Our external business development activities for 2022 included the acquisition of ChemoCentryx, adding recently launched TAVNEOS to our inflammation portfolio. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program, with launches in new markets. Our biosimilars are expected to continue launching in new markets throughout 2023, including the U.S. launch of AMJEVITA in January 2023.\nDuring 2022, while gradually recovering from the global pandemic and facing increased competition from biosimilars and generics, total product sales increased 2%, primarily driven by volume growth for certain brands, partially offset by declines in net selling prices of certain products and unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates. Product sales increased 3% in the United States, primarily driven by volume growth, partially offset by declines in net selling prices, and increased 1% in ROW, primarily driven by volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates and declines in net selling prices. Total operating expenses decreased 9% due to both the acquired IPR&D write-off from the Five Prime acquisition and a licensing-related upfront payment to KKC in 2021, partially offset by a loss on a nonstrategic divestiture in 2022.\nCash flows from operating activities totaled $9.7 billion, which supported investment in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2022, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.94 per share of common stock. In December 2022, we declared a cash dividend of $2.13 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2023. We also repurchased 26.1 million shares of our common stock during 2022 at an aggregate cost of $6.3 billion. In 2022, we received net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $6.9 billion and extinguished $0.3 billion of debt. In December 2022, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Horizon, we entered into a bridge credit agreement and a term loan credit agreement which provide for borrowings in the aggregate of $28.5 billion.\nAmgen\u2019s approach to and investment in human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent to tackle the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines. Our compensation, benefits and development programs are designed to encourage performance, promote accountability and adherence to Company values, and align with the interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders. Further, we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. We are engaging in activities and setting goals to improve our focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging. For further information on these and other efforts, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Human Capital Resources.\nWe have a long-standing ambition to be environmentally responsible, and we regularly set targets to challenge ourselves to deliver further improvements. We achieved our targets for the 2013-2020 period while growing revenues, increasing production capacity and expanding to approximately 100 countries over the same period. To continue on our path to greater environmental sustainability, in January 2021 we announced a new set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2027, including achieving carbon neutrality, reducing water consumption by 40% and reducing waste disposed by 75%.(1)(2) Additionally, in 2022 we issued our first green bonds to finance eligible projects that meet specified criteria to reduce our impact on the environment.\nOur long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses from when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Patents, and Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We also face increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.\nRising healthcare costs, uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including higher inflation and rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts continue to pose challenges to our business. As a result of public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to be subject to cost containment measures and significant pricing pressures, including net price declines. Moreover, legislation enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures, including provisions of the IRA, have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These buying patterns can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales but have generally not been significant to date when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products, and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain factors that could impact our future product sales.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nSince the onset of the pandemic in 2020, we have been closely monitoring the pandemic\u2019s effects on our global operations. We continue to take appropriate steps to minimize risks to our employees, a significant number of whom have continued to work virtually. To date, our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations, and we have not experienced disruptions to or shortages of our supply of medicines.\nOver the course of the pandemic we have experienced changes in demand for some of our products as fluctuations in the frequency of patient visits to doctors\u2019 offices have impacted the provision of treatments to existing patients and reduced diagnoses in new patients. During 2021, there was a gradual recovery in both patient visits and diagnosis rates that approached pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, the pandemic continued to impact the healthcare sector and our business, to varying degrees across our markets. During 2022, with the exception of the Asia Pacific region that was affected by lockdowns during most of the year, we saw greater stability in patient visits and demand patterns even in areas that were facing surges in the virus. Given the evolution of COVID-19 since its onset, including the proliferation of variants, we cannot predict the impact of future virus surges on our business and will continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business and on the healthcare sector more generally.\nSince early 2021, efforts have been under way to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainty remains as to the efficacy of these activities with respect to the ongoing trajectory of the pandemic. Challenges to vaccination efforts, new variants and other causes of virus spread may require governments to change restrictions and/or shutdown requirements in various geographies. As a result, we expect to see continued volatility for at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions.\nWith regard to our clinical trial activities, we are continuously monitoring COVID-19 infection rates, including changes from new variants; we are working to mitigate effects on future study enrollment in our clinical trials; and we are evaluating the impact in all relevant countries. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in their providing care for patients and in our providing investigational drug supply. For a discussion of the risks the COVID-19 pandemic could present to our results, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\n(1) Represents reductions against established baselines, taking into account only verified reduction projects and does not take into account changes associated with contraction or expansion of the Company.\n(2) Carbon neutrality goal refers to Scope 1 and 2.\nSelected Financial Information\nThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data):\nIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to volume growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies).\nTotal product sales increased in 2022, primarily driven by volume growth for certain brands, including Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY, Nplate, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, KYPROLIS, Otezla and TEZSPIRE, partially offset by declines in net selling prices of certain products, including Neulasta, Repatha and MVASI, and unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates. For 2023, we expect that net selling prices will continue to decline at a portfolio level driven by increased competition. Further, the first quarter of a year historically represents the lowest product sales quarter for the year, in part due to plan changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, particularly for products acquired through pharmacy benefit programs.\nAs a result of uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we expect volatility around foreign currency exchange rates to continue. The impact of unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates will be partially offset by corresponding decreases in our international operating expenses. While not designed to completely address foreign currency changes, our hedging activities also seek to offset, in part, such effects on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros.\nAs discussed above, our product sales have been affected by reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, the dynamics of the pandemic were most significant on our product sales in the early months of the pandemic, with demand beginning to show some recovery in late 2020. In late 2021 and early 2022, increased infection rates caused by variants of the virus (including Omicron) led to diminished capacity in the healthcare sector and reduced working days for our own sales force, which impacted our business. As of the second quarter of 2022, we saw the effects of these variants recede in most markets, which allowed us to engage in increased field-facing activities. Provider and patient activity also increased, leading to improvements in demand for our products to pre-pandemic levels. However, the cumulative decrease in diagnoses over the course of the pandemic has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which continues to impact our business. Given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, there could be intermittent disruptions in physician-patient interactions, and as a result, we may experience quarter-to-quarter variability. In addition, other changes in the healthcare ecosystem have the potential to introduce variability into product sales trends. For example, changes in U.S. employment have led to changes to the insured population. Growth in numbers of Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals, along with provisions of the IRA, may have a negative impact on product sales. Overall, uncertainty remains around the timing and magnitude of our sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.\nOther revenues decreased for 2022, driven by lower revenue from COVID-19 antibody material and licensing-related revenues.\nOperating expenses decreased for 2022 due to both the acquired IPR&D write-off related to the bemarituzumab program acquired as part of the Five Prime acquisition and a licensing-related upfront payment to KKC in 2021, partially offset by a loss\non a nonstrategic divestiture in 2022. See Part IV-Note 2, Acquisitions and divestitures, and Note 8, Collaborations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nProduct sales\nWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\n____________\n(1) Consists of product sales of our non-principal products, as well as our Gensenta and Bergamo subsidiaries.\nFuture sales of our products will depend in part on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition, in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products\u2019 significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition.\nENBREL\nTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe decrease in ENBREL sales for 2022 was primarily driven by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, lower volume and lower net selling price. For 2023, we expect ENBREL to follow the historical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. In addition, for 2023, we expect further declines in net selling price.\nThe decrease in ENBREL sales for 2021 was driven by lower net selling price, volume and unfavorable changes to inventory.\nProlia\nTotal Prolia sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increase in global Prolia sales for 2022 was driven by volume growth and higher net selling price, partially offset by unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe increase in global Prolia sales for 2021 was primarily driven by volume growth.\nOtezla\nTotal Otezla sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increase in global Otezla sales for 2022 was primarily driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. ROW Otezla sales for 2022 were impacted by unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates. For 2023, we expect Otezla to follow the historical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles.\nThe increase in global Otezla sales for 2021 was driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to inventory.\nFor a discussion of ongoing litigation related to Otezla, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nXGEVA\nTotal XGEVA sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nGlobal XGEVA sales were relatively unchanged for 2022 as higher net selling price was offset by lower volume as a result of increased competition and unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe increase in global XGEVA sales for 2021 was primarily driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price.\nAranesp\nTotal Aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe decrease in global Aranesp sales for 2022 was driven by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and volume growth.\nThe decrease in global Aranesp sales for 2021 was primarily driven by lower net selling price.\nAranesp continues to face competition from a long-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN, which will impact net selling price and volume in the future.\nNplate\nTotal Nplate sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increase in global Nplate sales for 2022 was driven by volume growth. Nplate sales for 2022 included a $207 million order in the fourth quarter from the U.S. government.\nThe increase in global Nplate sales for 2021 was primarily driven by volume growth.\nRepatha\nTotal Repatha sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increase in global Repatha sales for 2022 was driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to foreign currency exchange rates. Volume benefited from contracting changes to support and improve Medicare Part D and commercial patient access and the inclusion of Repatha on China\u2019s National Reimbursement Drug List as of January 1, 2022, both of which resulted in decreases to the net selling price in 2022.\nThe increase in global Repatha sales for 2021 was driven by volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price.\nFor a discussion of ongoing litigation related to Repatha, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nKYPROLIS\nTotal KYPROLIS sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increases in global KYPROLIS sales for 2022 and 2021 were primarily driven by volume growth.\nThe FDA has reported that it has granted tentative or final approval of ANDAs for generic carfilzomib products filed by a number of companies. The date of approval of those ANDAs for generic carfilzomib products is governed by the Hatch-Waxman Act and any applicable settlement agreements between us and certain companies that seek to develop generic carfilzomib products.\nNeulasta\nTotal Neulasta sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe decreases in global Neulasta sales for 2022 and 2021 were driven by lower net selling price and volume.\nIncreased competition as a result of biosimilar versions of Neulasta has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on brand sales, including accelerating net price erosion and lower volume. We also expect other biosimilar versions, including biosimilars that will use an on-body injector that would compete with our Onpro injector, to be approved in the future.\nEVENITY\nTotal EVENITY sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increases in global EVENITY sales for 2022 and 2021 were driven by volume growth across our markets.\nOther products\nOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nNM = not meaningful\n* Change in excess of 100%\n____________\n(1) TAVNEOS was acquired on October 20, 2022 from our acquisition of ChemoCentryx.\n(2) Consists of Corlanor, AVSOLA, IMLYGIC and RIABNI, as well as sales by our Gensenta and Bergamo subsidiaries.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nNM = not meaningful\n* Change in excess of 100%\nCost of sales\nCost of sales decreased to 24.3% of total revenues for 2022, driven by lower COVID-19 antibody shipments and manufacturing costs, partially offset by changes in our product mix.\nCost of sales increased to 24.8% of total revenues for 2021, driven by changes in our product mix and higher profit share and royalties, partially offset by lower amortization expense from acquisition-related assets and lower manufacturing costs.\nResearch and development\nThe Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (i) research and early pipeline, (ii) later-stage clinical programs and (iii) marketed products. These categories are described below:\nR&D expense by category was as follows (in millions):\nThe decrease in R&D expense for 2022 was driven by higher business development activity in 2021 included in later-stage clinical programs and research and early pipeline and lower marketed products support, partially offset by higher later-stage clinical programs support and research and early pipeline spend.\nThe increase in R&D expense for 2021 was driven by a licensing-related upfront payment to KKC included in later-stage clinical programs and higher spend in research and early pipeline, including other business development activities.\nAcquired in-process research and development\nThe Acquired IPR&D expense in 2021 was related to the bemarituzumab program, which was acquired as part of the Five Prime acquisition in 2021. See Part IV-Note 2, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelling, general and administrative\nThe increase in SG&A expense for 2022 was primarily driven by higher acquisition-related expenses.\nThe decrease in SG&A expense for 2021 was primarily driven by lower spend for marketed products and lower general and administrative expenses.\nOther\nOther operating expenses for 2022 primarily consisted of a loss on a nonstrategic divestiture. See Part IV-Note 2, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther operating expenses for 2021 primarily consisted of expenses related to cost-savings initiatives and a legal judgment.\nOther operating expenses for 2020 primarily consisted of legal settlement expenses.\nNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes\nNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nInterest expense, net\nThe increase in Interest expense, net, for 2022 was primarily due to higher overall debt outstanding and higher LIBORs on debt for which we effectively pay a variable rate of interest through the use of interest rate swaps.\nThe decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2021 was primarily due to net higher costs associated with the early retirement of debt in 2020 and lower LIBORs in 2021 on debt for which we effectively pay a variable rate of interest through the use of interest rate swaps, partially offset by higher overall debt outstanding.\nOther (expense) income, net\nThe change in Other (expense) income, net, for 2022 was primarily due to higher losses recognized in connection with our BeiGene investment compared with 2021 and losses recognized on our investments in limited partnerships, publicly traded equity securities and other strategic investments.\nThe change in Other (expense) income, net, for 2021 was primarily due to lower losses incurred in connection with our BeiGene investment compared with 2020, partially offset by lower income on our interest-bearing investments in 2021 and other nonrecurring gains recognized in 2020.\nIncome taxes\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2022 compared with 2021 was primarily due to the nondeductible IPR&D expense arising from the acquisition of Five Prime in the prior year, partially offset by a nondeductible loss on a nonstrategic divestiture in 2022 and net unfavorable items as compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2021 compared with 2020 was primarily driven by the nondeductible IPR&D expense arising from the acquisition of Five Prime, partially offset by earnings mix and adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities.\nThe Administration and Congress continue to discuss changes to existing tax law that could substantially increase the taxes we pay to the U.S. government. Further, the OECD recently reached an agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. If enacted, either by all OECD participants or unilaterally by individual countries, this agreement could result in a tax increase that could affect our U.S. and foreign tax liabilities.\nThe U.S. Treasury released final foreign tax credit regulations in December 2021 that eliminated U.S. creditability of the Puerto Rico Excise Tax beginning in 2023, which would have increased our U.S. tax liability. In response, on June 30, 2022, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2022, which provides for an alternate fixed tax rate on industrial development income that the U.S. Treasury confirmed will be creditable under federal law. As part of this new law, eligible businesses will be subject to incremental income and withholding taxes in lieu of payment of the Puerto Rico Excise Tax. In order to qualify for the alternative fixed tax rate, our current tax grant with the Puerto Rico government was amended in December 2022. We qualify for this alternative fixed tax rate, beginning January 1, 2023 and our tax expense will increase.\nIn 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010-2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010-2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010-2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2010-2012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013-2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010-2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013-2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013-2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2013-2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.\nWe firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022.\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016-2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.\nFinal resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and\nuncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability; Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis or Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Income taxes; and Part IV-Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nSelected financial data was as follows (in millions):\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nOur balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $9.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.\nCapital allocation\nConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we deploy our accumulated cash balances in a strategic manner and consider a number of alternatives, including investments in innovation, both internally and externally, strategic transactions (including those that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases.\nWe intend to continue investing in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business and our desire to optimize our cost of capital. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company\u2019s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include block purchases, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases and market transactions.\nThe Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.94, $1.76 and $1.60 per share of common stock paid in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 10% over the prior year in both 2022 and 2021. In December 2022, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $2.13 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2023.\nWe also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2022, we repurchased $6.3 billion of common stock, including $6.0 billion under ASR agreements and had cash settlements for stock repurchases of $6.4 billion. In 2021, we repurchased and had cash settlements of $5.0 billion of common stock. In 2020, we repurchased and had cash settlements of $3.5 billion of common stock. In October 2022, the Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by $2.4 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $7.0 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.\nAs a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position.\nWe believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock, and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities, and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.\nFinancing arrangements\nTo help meet our liquidity requirements, we have entered into various financing arrangements. The noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, were $37.4 billion and $33.2 billion, respectively. The carrying values of our long-term borrowings are net of fair value adjustments for interest rate swaps and unamortized discounts, premiums and offering costs. As of December 31, 2022, S&P, Moody\u2019s and Fitch assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of BBB+, Baa1 and BBB+, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, we issued debt with aggregate principal amounts of $7.0 billion, $5.0 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively. During 2022, we repurchased portions of our debt at a cost of $0.3 billion. During 2021 and 2020, we repaid/redeemed debt of $4.2 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. In addition, during 2020, we exchanged $0.7 billion of certain of our outstanding note issuances with $0.9 billion of newly issued notes with a lower interest rate and later maturity date.\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating, LIBOR-based coupon over the lives of the respective notes. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amount of $6.7 billion.\nTo hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amount of $3.4 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nIn 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. In December 2022, this revolving credit agreement was further amended to replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate, pursuant to provisions contained therein related to determination of successor rates in case of phaseout or unavailability of existing designated reference rates. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) SOFR plus 1.125% or (ii) the highest of (A) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month SOFR plus 1.1%. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.\nIn December 2022, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Horizon, we entered into a bridge credit agreement and a term loan credit agreement which provide for borrowings in the aggregate of $28.5 billion. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts have been borrowed under either agreement. See Part IV-Note 2, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIt is anticipated that the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate will be phased out and replaced by 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private-market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help ensure a successful transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to a more robust reference rate, recommends SOFR as the U.S. dollar LIBOR alternative. As such, we expect SOFR to become widely adopted by market participants. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.\nIn February 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2023, and our Board has approved a new shelf registration statement to replace it.\nCertain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement, bridge credit agreement and term loan credit agreement include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the respective agreements. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2022.\nThese financing arrangements are more fully discussed in Part IV-Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash flows\nOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):\nOperating\nCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2022 primarily due to the timing of payments for sales incentives and discounts, vendor purchases, liabilities to tax authorities and receipts from corporate partners, partially offset by higher manufacturing activities in the current year. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2021 primarily due to the monetization of interest rate swaps that occurred in 2020 and the timing of payments for sales incentives and discounts.\nInvesting\nCash used in investing activities during 2022 was primarily due to our $3.8 billion purchase of ChemoCentryx and net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $1.4 billion. Cash provided by investing activities during 2021 was primarily due to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $4.3 billion, partially offset by cash used in the acquisitions of Teneobio and Five Prime of $2.5 billion. Cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily due to our $3.2 billion of purchases of equity method investments, primarily BeiGene, and net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $1.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $936 million, $880 million and $608 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We currently estimate 2023 spending on capital projects to be approximately $925 million. A majority of the increase in expenditures relates to expansion of manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates.\nFinancing\nCash used in financing activities during 2022 was primarily due to payments to repurchase our common stock of $6.4 billion and dividends paid of $4.2 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt of $6.9 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2021 was primarily due to payments to repurchase our common stock of $5.0 billion and the payment of dividends of $4.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of repayments of $0.8 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2020 was primarily due to the payment of dividends of $3.8 billion and payments to repurchase our common stock of $3.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments of $2.5 billion.\nSee Part IV-Note 9, Investments; Note 15, Financing arrangements; and Note 16, Stockholders\u2019 equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital requirements\nWe have material cash requirements to pay third parties under various contractual obligations discussed below.\nWe are obligated to pay interest and repay principal under our various financing arrangements, including amounts under interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts related to certain of our long-term debt obligations. For information on scheduled debt maturities and payments under derivative contracts associated with our long-term debt obligations, see Part IV-Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are obligated to make payments for operating leases, including rental commitments on abandoned leases and leases that have not yet commenced. For information on these obligations, see Part IV-Note 13, Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnder the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. For information on the remaining scheduled repatriation tax installments, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments-Commitments-U.S. repatriation tax, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have purchase obligations of $3.5 billion primarily related to (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Most of these obligations are expected to be paid within one year, and payment of certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.\nIn addition to the purchase obligations noted above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts that in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of Teneobio and K-A. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring, and any resulting cash requirements are managed through our operational budgeting processes. Except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration of approximately $0.3 billion, these obligations are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $5.6 billion.\nWe have recorded liabilities for UTBs that, because of their nature, have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payment and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV-Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are included in Part IV-Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies. The following are considered critical to our consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nProduct sales and sales deductions\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions):\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, total sales deductions were 51%, 47% and 44% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, was primarily driven by the impact of higher U.S. chargeback and commercial rebate discount rates and an increase in gross sales, partially offset by timing of payments. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates.\nIn the United States, we use wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.\nAccruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold.\nRebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements that vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect\nactual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ.\nWholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results because chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.\nProduct returns\nReturns are estimated by comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.\nIncome taxes\nWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, when appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.\nCertain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements, and they cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as tax deductions or credits in tax returns in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and the tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, because future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.\nWe are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In the jurisdictions where we conduct operations, we are subject to income tax based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and on the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2050.\nIn 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010-2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010-2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010-2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2010-2012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013-2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010-2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013-2015 that we received in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013-2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2013-2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.\nWe firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022.\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016-2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. In addition, we have examinations by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.\nFinal resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability; Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations, Income taxes; and Part IV-Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOur operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nContingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.\nWhile it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nValuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions\nWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. See Part IV-Note 2, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to:\n\u2022determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;\n\u2022projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;\n\u2022estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and\n\u2022developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the business combination date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included but were not limited to the timing and probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.\nWe believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared with the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset\u2019s fair value and its carrying value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference, and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.\nEstimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.\nImpairment of equity method investments\nWe review the carrying value of our equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may not be recoverable. We record impairment losses on our equity method investments if we deem the impairment to be other-than-temporary. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary based on various factors, including but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value is below the carrying value, volatility of the security price, the financial condition of the issuer, changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment and our intent and ability to retain the investment to allow for a recovery in fair value.\nWe believe our judgments used in assessing impairment of equity method investments are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Part IV-Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2022.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.\nIn the discussion that follows, we assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Except as noted below, we also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nInterest-rate-sensitive financial instruments\nOur portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was composed almost entirely of U.S. Treasury securities and money market mutual funds. The fair values of our available-for-sale investments were $4.3 billion and $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair values of these securities. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $38.9 billion and a fair value of $35.0 billion. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.3 billion and a fair value of $37.9 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would have resulted in an increase of $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective notes. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $6.7 billion were outstanding as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $210 million and $330 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\nIn connection with the anticipated issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt, we occasionally enter into forward interest rate contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges, in order to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable U.S. Treasury rate between the time we enter into these contracts and the time the related debt is issued. As of December 31, 2022, we had forward interest rate contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $700 million; there were no outstanding forward interest rate contracts as of December 31, 2021. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2022 would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately $60 million on our forward interest rate contracts on this date.\nAs of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amount of $3.4 billion that hedge our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $90 million and $170 million, respectively.\nForeign-currency-sensitive financial instruments\nOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward and cross-currency swap contracts.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $580 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $600 million. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $710 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $640 million. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.\nWe have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs, with aggregate notional amount of $3.4 billion as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $540 million and $700 million on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing years\u2019 income from these contracts would be fully offset by corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2022, the fair values of these contracts were a $288 million asset and a $76 million liability. As of December 31, 2021, the fair values of these contracts were a $183 million asset and a $39 million liability. As of December 31, 2022, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $6.0 billion. As of December 31, 2021, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.7 billion. With regard to foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $590 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $390 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had open, short-duration, foreign currency forward contracts that mature in one month or less, that had notional amounts of $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, and that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\nMarket-price-sensitive financial instruments\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we were exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments include publicly and privately held small-capitalization stocks, limited partnerships that invest in early-stage biotechnology companies\nand our investment in BeiGene. A 20% decrease in the aggregate value of our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would result in losses in fair value of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\nCounterparty credit risks\nOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring that transactions be made only with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&P, Moody\u2019s or Fitch; and it places exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe maintain \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\u201d as such term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen\u2019s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen\u2019s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen\u2019s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen\u2019s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement determined that as of December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Amgen Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Amgen Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amgen Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report dated February 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nLos Angeles, California\nFebruary 9, 2023",

    "item_12": "Item 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Existing Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2022, concerning the shares of our common stock that may be issued under any form of award granted under our equity compensation plans in effect as of December 31, 2022 (including upon the exercise of options, upon the vesting of awards of RSUs or when performance units are earned and related dividend equivalents have been granted).\n(1)The Amended 2009 Plan employs a fungible share-counting formula for determining the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each RSU, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share-counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance, and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 200% of the performance units granted in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes (i) 5,322,407 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $207.29; (ii) 3,173,806 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 307,825 related dividend equivalents); and (iii) 1,739,407 shares subject to outstanding 2020, 2021 and 2022 performance units (including 84,603 related dividend equivalents). The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2022, employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2020, 2021 and 2022 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event above target performance on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units is achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n(2)This plan has terminated as to future grants. The number under column (a) with respect to this plan includes 2,191 shares issuable upon the settlement of deferred RSUs (including 519 related dividend equivalents).\n(3)The Profit Sharing Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on July 28, 2011. The Profit Sharing Plan permits eligible employees of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries located in Ireland who participate in the Profit Sharing Plan to apply a portion of their qualifying bonus and salary to the purchase of the Company\u2019s common stock on the open market at the market price by a third-party trustee as described in the Profit Sharing Plan.\nSecurity Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers and Certain Beneficial Owners\nInformation about security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management is incorporated by reference from the sections entitled SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS and SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS in our Proxy Statement.",
