For information regarding our revenue by geographic area, and property and equipment by geographic area, please see \u201cNote 15 - Segment and Geographic Information\u201d in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations.\nCustomers, Sales and Marketing\nOur target customers are original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) and original design manufacturers, both of which design and manufacture end market devices. We seek to strategically align our sales force along key customer lines in order to offer fully integrated platforms to our customers. In this way, we believe we can more effectively offer a broader set of content into our key customers\u2019 end products, without having multiple product groups separately engage the same customer. We seek to complement and support our direct sales force with manufacturers\u2019 representatives for our products in North America and Europe. In addition, we have contracted with distributors who support our sales and marketing activities in the United States, Europe and Asia. We also use third-party logistics providers who maintain warehouses in close proximity to our customers\u2019 facilities. We expect that a significant percentage of our sales will continue to come from direct sales to key customers.\nWe use field application engineers to provide technical support and assistance to existing and potential customers in designing, testing and qualifying systems designs that incorporate our products. Our marketing team works in conjunction with our field sales and application engineering force, and is organized around our product groups.\nDuring fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, there was no net revenue attributable to a customer, other than one distributor, whose revenues as a percentage of net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenues. Net revenue attributable to significant distributors whose revenues as a percentage of net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenues is presented in the following table:\nNet revenue attributable to Distributor A increased due to the change of four large module makers from direct to distribution accounts to align with our support business model in Asia.\nInventory and Working Capital\nWe typically place firm orders with our suppliers up to 52 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date and typically prior to an order for the product. Starting in fiscal 2022 and through the first half of fiscal 2023, in response to a large increase in demand from our customers for our products in a majority of our end markets as they continued to invest in data infrastructure, our operations team continued to increase production with our global supply chain partners to alleviate supply constraints. However, with the start of a broad inventory correction in the semiconductor industry, supply constraints have now mostly resolved. To secure capacity over the long term, we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into capacity reservation arrangements with certain foundries and partners for substrates. Our products typically have long multi-year lifecycles and we often maintain substantial inventories because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce improvements to our existing products and to develop new products that deliver cost-effective solutions for both existing and new markets. Our research and development efforts are directed largely to the development of high-performance analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits with the smallest die size and lowest power. We devote a significant portion of our resources to expanding our product portfolio based on a broad intellectual property portfolio with designs that are intended to enable high-performance, reliable communications over a variety of physical transmission media. We are also focused on incorporating functions currently provided by stand-alone integrated circuits into our integrated platform solutions to reduce our customers\u2019 overall system costs.\nWe have assembled a core team of engineers who have experience in the areas of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (\u201cCMOS\u201d) technology, digital signal processing, electro-optics, embedded microprocessors, mixed-signal circuit design, silicon photonics, and system-level architectures. We have invested and expect to continue to invest a significant amount in research and development. See our discussion of research and development expenses in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nManufacturing\nIntegrated Circuit Fabrication\nThe vast majority of our integrated circuits are fabricated using widely available CMOS processes, which is intended to provide greater flexibility to engage independent foundries to manufacture integrated circuits at lower costs. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facilities. This is intended to allow us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products. We seek to work closely with our foundry partners to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements. We also seek to closely monitor foundry production to help ensure consistent overall quality, reliability and yield levels. Our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced manufacturing processes. Because more precise manufacturing processes are expected to lead to enhanced performance, smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements, we continually seek to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance.\nAssembly and Test\nWe typically outsource all product packaging and testing requirements for our products in production to several assembly and test subcontractors primarily located in Taiwan, Canada, Korea, Singapore and China.\nGovernmental Regulations\nImport/Export, National Security and Other Regulations Related to International Operations and Ownership\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: intellectual property ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; conflict minerals; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health and safety requirements; and consumer laws. For example, government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products.\nA portion of the business we acquired in our Avera acquisition in fiscal 2021 requires facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence (\u201cFOCI\u201d). Because we were organized in Bermuda at the time of the Avera acquisition, we entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense with respect to FOCI mitigation arrangements that relate to our operation of the portion of the Avera business involving facility clearances. These measures and arrangements may materially and adversely affect our operating results due to the increased cost of compliance with these measures. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected. Now that we are domiciled in the United States, we have requested to be released from some of the above FOCI-related obligations. We can offer no assurance that such a request will be granted in a timely manner or at all.\nPrimarily as a result of our acquisition of Avera, we are now a party to certain contracts with the U.S. government and its subcontractors. Our contracts with government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance.\nSee \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on regulatory matters.\nEnvironmental Management\nWe are also subject to environmental rules and regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals SVHC Substances Directive, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive), China\u2019s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, and California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.\nWe believe that our products comply with the current Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and the Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals SVHC Substances Directive. In addition, each of our manufacturing subcontractors certifies to us compliance with ISO 14001:2004, the international standard related to environmental management. We are also working to establish a \u201cconflict-free\u201d supply chain, including ethical sourcing of certain minerals for our products.\nIntellectual Property\nOur future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property. As of January 28, 2023, we have over 10,000 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and other countries, covering various aspects of our technology. The expiration of our patents range from 2023 to 2042, and none of the patents expiring in the near future are expected to be material to our IP portfolio as we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. While we believe the duration of our patents generally covers the expected lives of our products, our patents may not collectively or individually cover every feature on innovation in our product. In addition, our efforts may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our intellectual property.\nWe have expended and expect to continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property. While our ability to compete is enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change, the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information.\nFrom time to time, we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products or in connection with a pending or future claim or action asserted against us. We cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThe integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation. From time to time, we receive, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties.\nIn addition, we have in the past and may in the future be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused other intellectual property rights, or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents, trademarks, or other rights. Although we defend these claims vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \u201cNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with patent litigation matters.\nCyber Security and Information Security Risk Oversight\nThe Company has a Cyber Security Governance Committee composed of executives and subject matter experts who meet no less than quarterly to review the Company\u2019s information security, programs, policies, and projects. The Company\u2019s Internal Audit Group reviews the cyber security governance and controls annually. In addition, at least quarterly the Audit Committee reviews reports on cyber security from the Chief Information Officer, the Chief Information Security Officer and other members of the Company\u2019s management team.\nWe regularly perform risk assessments relating to cyber security and technology risks. More specifically, an independent third party performs a quarterly penetration test of Marvell\u2019s IT infrastructure. In addition to quarterly penetration testing, at least once a year, we bring in an independent third party security firm to perform additional tests and audits. Risks identified in this process are analyzed to determine the impact on the Company and the likelihood of occurrence. Such risks are continuously monitored. We conduct information security training as part of our ongoing compliance program, and every employee of the Company is required to participate in such training. We install and regularly update anti-malware and endpoint detection and response (EDR software) on all IT-managed systems and workstations to detect and prevent malicious code from impacting our systems.\nThe Company has not experienced a material security breach in the last three years, and as a result, we have not incurred any net expenses from such a breach. We have not been penalized or paid any amount under an information security breach settlement over the last three years. Further, the Company periodically assesses its insurance coverage and has determined not to purchase cyber related insurance.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive, and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and pricing pressures. Competition has intensified as a result of the increasing demand for higher levels of performance, integration and smaller process geometries. We expect competition to further intensify as current competitors strengthen the depth and breadth of their product offerings, either through in-house development or by acquiring existing technology. In addition, some of our customers have chosen to develop certain semiconductor products internally and this trend may continue to proliferate. We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for our products depends on multiple factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the performance, features, quality and price of our products;\n\u2022the development execution, timing and success of enhanced and new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors;\n\u2022the emergence, rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards;\n\u2022market demand trends;\n\u2022competitive tactics;\n\u2022our ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity with the appropriate technological capability; and\n\u2022the number and nature of our competitors in a given market.\nCompanies that compete directly with our businesses include, but are not limited to, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(\u201cAMD\u201d), Astera Labs, Inc., Broadcom Inc.(\u201cBroadcom\u201d), Cisco Systems, Inc.(\u201cCisco\u201d), Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd, Intel Corporation, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., MediaTek Inc., Microchip Technology Inc., Montage Technology, Nvidia Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Phison Electronics Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated (\u201cQualcomm\u201d), Rambus, Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Semtech Corporation, Silicon Motion Technology Corporation, and Socionext Inc. We expect increased competition in the future from both emerging and established companies, as well as from alliances among competitors, customers or other third parties, any of which could acquire significant market share. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of competitive risks associated with our business.\nWe expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In order to offset expected declines in the selling prices of our products, we will need to continue to introduce innovative new products and attempt to reduce the cost to design and manufacture our products. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to implement design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing, assembly and testing of our products. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pricing risks.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that attracting, retaining and motivating a workforce with the ability to support our leading position in semiconductor innovation is essential to effectively execute our strategy. Accordingly, we believe our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate the highly skilled talent necessary to scale our business. We believe the people who work here are our greatest resource, and we encourage and empower all individuals employed at Marvell to excel to their greatest potential. We seek to create an environment that fuels collaboration and innovation, inspires our employees to give their best, and enables our business to thrive. We work hard to attract the industry\u2019s best talent, provide opportunities to learn and grow, and create an environment where our employees feel motivated, appreciated and engaged, and have a pathway to building a long-term career at Marvell.\nOur Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and its committees share oversight of our human capital management strategy. The Nominating and Governance Committee has oversight of our approach to human capital and inclusion and diversity as part of its broader focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d). Marvell annually conducts talent reviews and succession planning and the Board receives updates regularly from senior management on succession planning, management talent assessment, attrition and employee survey results. Our executive management team also reviews our human capital initiatives and our progress on such initiatives. The Audit Committee provides oversight of business risks and ethics and compliance programs, both of which have relevance for human capital- and workplace-related issues. The Executive Compensation Committee provides oversight of our overall compensation philosophy, policies and programs, and their respective alignment with our human capital strategy.\nThe Company employed 7,448 people as of January 28, 2023. As of January 28, 2023, our global workforce was comprised of approximately: 99.6% full time employees and 0.4% part time employees. Our employees sit across three geographical regions: 48.6% of employees are based in the Americas, 40.4% are in APAC (which includes India) and 11.0% are in EMEA.\nAt Marvell, we focus on employee retention by seeking to foster an environment where people can learn, develop, and advance their careers with us over the long term. We regularly monitor employee turnover, as given the nature of our business, our success depends upon highly trained personnel with the technical skills necessary to execute on our business objectives. We believe the combination of competitive compensation and career growth and development opportunities help to increase employee tenure and reduce voluntary turnover. Intern and entry level professional new hires are an important part of our overall talent pipeline and strategy, as students and entry level professionals often have knowledge in the latest research and innovations, and we want Marvell to benefit from that knowledge.\nCompetitive Compensation and Benefits\nWe believe we provide comprehensive, market-competitive compensation and benefits, including affordable health and wellness coverage, globally and consider them a key priority for attracting and keeping top talent. Each year, we benchmark our compensation and benefits programs against our industry peers to help ensure we maintain competitiveness in each of our markets. We seek to align our executives\u2019 long-term equity compensation with our stockholders\u2019 interests by linking realizable pay with performance.\nCulture, Engagement and Development\nMarvell\u2019s Core Behaviors lay the foundation of our culture and are centered around four key aspects:\n\u2022Act with integrity and treat everyone with respect,\n\u2022Innovate to solve customer needs,\n\u2022Execute with thoroughness and rigor, and\n\u2022Help others achieve their objectives.\nOur efforts to attract, develop, engage and retain employees, as well as our efforts to embed inclusion and diversity (\u201cI&D\u201d) across the Company, reinforce these behaviors. Our Core Behaviors also serve as a roadmap to help integrate employees as we grow through hiring and acquisitions.\nWe seek to take a holistic approach to helping employees feel engaged, connected and supported - from employee and family events, to learning and development, to weekly Company-wide emails from our CEO. One of the ways we measure levels of engagement is through our annual Voice of the Employee Survey. Survey results help us to better understand employee needs and opportunities for improvement, and to develop action plans to address them.\nWe offer a variety of employee training programs, including management training programs aligned with the level of managers, technical training, mandatory compliance trainings and voluntary professional development opportunities. In addition, we organize a wide range of employee events designed to foster a sense of community at Marvell.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges for all individuals and businesses. Our leadership has continued to engage and support employees through the pandemic in a range of ways, including sending frequent communication and resources, providing a number of four day \u201crecharge weekends,\u201d and surveying employees on the experience of working from home. See the Health and Safety section below for more details.\nInclusion and Diversity\nMarvell is committed to creating and fostering an inclusive, diverse and engaging workplace where people feel fulfilled, inspired and motivated to learn and grow both personally and professionally. We value the uniqueness that a diverse global team brings to our company, and we are focused on creating an environment that fully leverages the perspectives and contributions of every individual.\nOur Inclusion and Diversity (\u201cI&D\u201d) approach is centered around three key aspects:\n\u2022Interconnected across the company: Embedding inclusivity in every function and in everything we do\n\u2022Full participation and responsibility: Empowering every employee to do their part toward creating a welcoming and inclusive environment\n\u2022Globally aligned and locally relevant: Applying our global strategic framework to specific regional and local site needs\nOur efforts focus on four I&D business outcomes:\n\u2022Activate and empower leaders\n\u2022Create an inclusive best place to work\n\u2022Cultivate a diverse workforce\n\u2022Lead in the marketplace and community\nHealth and Safety\nWe believe everyone deserves a safe workplace that supports their health and wellbeing. To help create this environment, we seek to continue to evolve our programs and resources to support employees\u2019 mental and physical wellbeing.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed a continued emphasis on health and safety at Marvell, and we took various steps to promote the health, safety and wellness of our employees during the crisis.\nWhile our workplaces are mainly office facilities with limited safety hazards, we recognize the importance of preventing and addressing any risks that may occur. As a company, we work to prevent injury by focusing on ergonomics, employee training, maintenance, hazard reporting mechanisms and developing emergency action plans. We encourage our employees to report unsafe conditions.\nClimate Change\nClimate change is an important topic for Marvell. We recognize that climate change may pose potential risks and may create potential opportunities to our organization and are taking steps to further identify and assess the nature and magnitude of these risks and opportunities. As such, Marvell is working to develop plans to mitigate and manage any potential material climate change risks and to benefit from any potential climate change opportunities.\nManagement is responsible for formulating and executing our climate strategy. Marvell also runs an executive-level ESG Committee to provide senior leadership and strategic guidance on ESG, as well as ESG Working Groups who are responsible for gathering data, setting strategy and goals, and supporting disclosure efforts on material ESG topics. Marvell\u2019s Chief Operations Officer (the \u201cCOO\u201d) is the executive sponsor of the Environment Working Groups and has overall responsibility at the executive level for climate strategy and related issues. The COO is responsible for assessing and leading the management of climate-related risks and opportunities, elevating stakeholder concerns and guiding the implementation of climate-related policies, programs and disclosures. The COO is also a member of the executive-level ESG Committee, and, in that capacity, is responsible for elevating climate topics to Marvell\u2019s senior leadership and, ultimately, to the Board\u2019s Nominating and Governance and Audit Committees. The Nominating and Governance Committee has oversight of our climate strategy and ESG matters and receives quarterly updates on our ESG performance. Our Board of Directors receives periodic updates on our ESG performance.\nMarvell has an enterprise risk management process in place that may be leveraged to help identify potential climate-related risks and to assess the magnitude of such risks. We have already committed to and are in the process of setting a Science Based Target aligned with the latest climate science to remain within the 1.5\u00b0C warming limit established under the Paris Agreement. We have reported against the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) framework in our Fiscal Year 2022 ESG Report and have conducted scenario analysis on the potential impacts of climate change to our business in alignment with the TCFD framework.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the material risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this report before you decide to purchase our common stock. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control, including business cycles and seasonal trends of the computing, infrastructure, semiconductor and related industries and end markets. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, render us unable to conduct our business as currently planned and materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and operating results. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties; our operations could also be affected by risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following discussion to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.\nSUMMARY OF FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS\nThe following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in the Company speculative or risky. This summary should be read in conjunction with the remainder of this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described in our public filings when evaluating our business.\n\u2022risks related to changes in general economic conditions such as economic slowdowns, inflation, stagflation, rising interest rates, and recessions or political conditions, such as the tariffs and trade restrictions with China, Russia and other foreign nations, and specific conditions in the end markets we address, including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry and the U.S. National Science and Technology Council\u2019s designation of semiconductors as a critical and emerging technology;\n\u2022risks related to cancellations, rescheduling or deferrals of significant customer orders or shipments, as well as the ability of our customers to manage inventory;\n\u2022risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemics, on the global economy and on our customers, suppliers, employees and business;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to scale our business;\n\u2022risks related to the extension of lead time due to supply chain disruptions, component shortages that impact the costs and production of our products and kitting process, and constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers\u2019 ability to ship their products, which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers;\n\u2022risks related to the ability of our customers, particularly in jurisdictions such as China that may be subject to trade restrictions (including the need to obtain export licenses) to develop their own solutions or acquire fully developed solutions from third-parties;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to design, develop and introduce new and enhanced products, in particular in the 5G and Cloud markets, in a timely and effective manner, as well as our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to successfully integrate and to realize anticipated benefits or synergies, on a timely basis or at all, in connection with our past, current, or any future acquisitions, divestitures, significant investments or strategic transactions;\n\u2022risks related to our debt obligations;\n\u2022risks related to the highly competitive nature of the end markets we serve, particularly within the semiconductor and infrastructure industries;\n\u2022risks related to our dependence on a few customers for a significant portion of our revenue including risks related to severe financial hardship or bankruptcy or other attrition of one or more of our major customers, particularly as our major customers comprise an increasing percentage of our revenue;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to execute on changes in strategy and realize the expected benefits from restructuring activities;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure for our manufacturing, assembly, testing and packaging processes and our reliance on third parties to produce our products;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly skilled workforce, especially engineering, managerial, sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022risks related to any current and future litigation, regulatory investigations, or contractual disputes with customers that could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully maintain and grow our business;\n\u2022risks related to gain or loss of a design win or key customer;\n\u2022risks related to seasonality or volatility related to sales into the infrastructure, semiconductor and related industries and end markets;\n\u2022risks related to failures to qualify our products or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing lines;\n\u2022risks related to failures to protect our intellectual property, particularly outside the United States;\n\u2022risks related to the potential impact of significant events or natural disasters or the effects of climate change (such as drought, flooding, wildfires, increased storm severity, sea level rise, and power outages), particularly in certain regions in which we operate or own buildings, such as Santa Clara, California, and where our third party manufacturing partners or suppliers operate, such as Taiwan and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim;\n\u2022risks related to our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) programs; and\n\u2022risks related to failures of our customers to agree to pay for NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs, failure to pay enough to cover the costs we incur in connection with NREs or non-payment of previously agreed NRE costs due to us.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and could do so in the future. Because our results of operations are difficult to predict, you should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Due to fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and other factors, the price at which our common stock will trade is likely to continue to be highly volatile. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your common stock at or above the price you paid. In future periods, our stock price could decline if, among other factors, our revenue or operating results are below our estimates or the estimates or expectations of securities analysts and investors. Our stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol \u201cMRVL\u201d. As a result of stock price volatility, we may be subject to securities class action litigation. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully maintain and grow our business.\nCHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nWe face risks related to recessions, inflation, stagflation and other economic conditions\nCustomer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, inflation, stagflation, recessionary or lower-growth environments, rising interest rates, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. For example, under these conditions or expectation of such conditions, our customers may cancel orders, delay purchasing decisions or reduce their use of our services. In addition, these economic conditions could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges from our manufacturing partners if we need to slow production to reduce inventory levels. Further, in the event of a recession or threat of a recession our manufacturing partners, suppliers, distributors, and other third-party partners may suffer their own financial and economic challenges and as a result they may demand pricing accommodations, delay payment, or become insolvent, which could harm our ability to meet our customer demands or collect revenue or otherwise could harm our business. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our manufacturing partners, customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like, and our borrowing costs could increase. Thus, if general macroeconomic conditions, or conditions in the semiconductor industry, or conditions in our customer end markets continue to deteriorate or experience a sustained period of weakness or slower growth, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, we are also subject to risk from inflation and increasing market prices of certain components, supplies, and commodity raw materials, which are incorporated into our end products or used by our manufacturing partners or suppliers to manufacture our end products. These components, supplies and commodities have from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions have in the past and may in the future affect pricing of such components, supplies and commodities (such as inflation or supply chain constraints). See also, \u201cOur gross margin and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our average selling prices of products over time, shifts in our product mix, or price increases of certain components or third-party services due to inflation, supply chain constraints, or for other reasons.\u201d\nUnfavorable or uncertain conditions in the 5G and Cloud markets may cause fluctuations in our rate of revenue growth or financial results.\nWorld-wide markets for our 5G and Cloud products may not develop in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate. If domestic and global economic conditions continue to worsen, overall spending on our 5G and Cloud products may be reduced, which would adversely impact demand for our products in these markets. In addition, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to these products and suppliers may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, and negatively impact our long-term expectations in this area. Even if the 5G and Cloud markets develop in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate, if we do not have timely, competitively priced, market-accepted products available to meet our customers\u2019 planned roll-out of 5G wireless communication systems or Cloud systems, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, as a result of the fact that the markets for 5G and Cloud are still developing, demand for these products may be unpredictable and may vary significantly from one period to another. See also, \u201cOur sales are concentrated in a few large customers. If we lose or experience a significant reduction in sales to any of these key customers, if any of these key customers experience a significant decline in market share, or if any of these customers experience significant financial difficulties, our revenue may decrease substantially and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\u201d See also, \u201cAdverse changes in the political and economic policies of the U.S. government in connection with trade with China have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business\u201d for additional risks related to export restrictions that may impact certain customers in the 5G and Cloud markets.\nOur sales are concentrated in a few large customers. If we lose or experience a significant reduction in sales to any of these key customers, if any of these key customers experience a significant decline in market share, or if any of these customers experience significant financial difficulties, our revenue may decrease substantially and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers. For example, during fiscal 2023, we had one distributor, whose revenue as a percentage of our net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenues. In addition, net revenue from our ten (10) largest customers, including this distributor, represented 63% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023. Sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period and year to year and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer, the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets, adverse changes in the political and economic policies of the U.S. or other governments (such as changes in export policies), and natural disasters or other issues. The loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent one or more of our large customers experience financial challenges, bankruptcy or insolvency, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales and our ability to collect on receivables, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to increase the number of large customers in key markets, then our operating results in the foreseeable future would be expected to continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers, as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products. In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:\n\u2022a significant portion of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which allows our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with relatively short notice to us;\n\u2022customers may purchase similar products from our competitors;\n\u2022customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products;\n\u2022customers, particularly in jurisdictions such as China that may be subject to trade restrictions or tariffs, may develop their own solutions or acquire fully developed solutions from third-parties; or\n\u2022customers may be subject to severe business disruptions, including, but not limited to, those driven by recessions, financial instability, actual or threatened public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other global or regional macroeconomic developments, or natural disasters.\nIn addition, there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships (for example, Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2017, Toshiba Corporation sold control of a portion of its semiconductor business in 2018, and Cisco acquired Acacia Communications in 2021). Mergers or restructuring among our customers, or their end customers, could increase our customer concentration with a particular customer or reduce total demand as the combined entities reevaluate their business and consolidate their suppliers. Such future developments, particularly in those end markets that account for more significant portions of our revenues, could harm our business and our results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be unable to negotiate as favorable terms with larger customers whether those customers resulted from customer consolidation, merger integrations or other reasons, and any such less favorable terms could harm our business and our results of operations.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet that demand which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.\nWe typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments. Some of our customers have, and others may in the future, cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. In addition, customers who have purchase commitments may not honor those commitments. Due to their inability to predict demand or other reasons, during the last few years some of our customers have accumulated excess inventories and, as a consequence, they either have deferred or they may defer future purchases of our products. We cannot accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management.\nWe place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. For example, our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may be impaired by the delays inherent in our customer\u2019s product development processes, which may include extensive qualification and testing of components included in their products, including ours. In many cases, they design their products to use components from multiple suppliers. This creates the risk that our customers may decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our semiconductor solutions prior to completion, which makes it even more difficult to forecast customer demand. In addition, while many of our customers are subject to purchase orders or other agreements that do not allow for cancellation, there can be no assurance that these customers will honor these contract terms and cancellation of these orders may adversely affect our business operations and demand forecast which is the basis for us to have products made.\nOur products are incorporated into complex devices and systems, which creates supply chain cross-dependencies. Due to cross dependencies, supply chain disruptions have in the past and may in the future negatively impact the demand for our products. We have a limited ability to predict the timing of a supply chain correction. As we have a broad product portfolio and diversified products with many different SKUs, significant supply chain disruptions will cause us to have more work-in-process inventories we hold to ensure we have flexibility to support our customers. If we cannot predict future customer demand or supply chain disruptions, then we may hold excess or obsolete inventory. Moreover, significant supply chain disruption may negatively impact the timing of our product shipments and revenue shipment linearity which may impact and extend our cash conversion cycle. In addition, the market share of our customers could be adversely impacted on a long-term basis due to any continued supply chain disruption, which could negatively affect our results of operations. See also, \u201cWe rely on our manufacturing partners for the manufacture, assembly, testing and packaging of our products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business\u201d for additional information on the impacts of supply chain cross-dependencies on our business.\nIf we overestimate customer demand, our excess or obsolete inventory may increase significantly, which would reduce our gross margin and adversely affect our financial results. The risk of obsolescence and/or excess inventory is heightened for semiconductor solutions designed for consumer electronics due to the rapidly changing market for these types of products. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\nWe operate in intensely competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively would harm our results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry, and specifically the storage, networking and infrastructure markets, is extremely competitive. We currently compete with a number of large domestic and international companies in the business of designing semiconductor solutions and related applications, some of which have greater financial, technical and management resources than us. Our efforts to introduce new products into markets with entrenched competitors will expose us to additional competitive pressures. For example, we are facing, and expect we will continue to face, significant competition in the infrastructure, networking and SSD storage markets. Additionally, customer expectations and requirements have been evolving rapidly. For example, customers now expect us to provide turnkey solutions and commit to future roadmaps that have technical risks.\nSome of our competitors may be better situated to meet changing customer needs and secure design wins. Increasing competition in the markets in which we operate may negatively impact our revenue and gross margins. For example, competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us, or they may offer additional products, services or other incentives that we may not be able to match.\nWe also may experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices by our competitors that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business. In addition, some of these competitors may use their market power to dissuade our customers from purchasing from us.\nIn addition, many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do.\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry has experienced increased consolidation over the past several years. For example, NVIDIA Corporation acquired Mellanox Technologies in April 2020, Infineon acquired Cypress Semiconductors in April 2020, Renesas Electronics Corporation acquired Dialog Semiconductor in August 2021, AMD acquired Xilinx, Inc. in February 2022 and Pensando Systems in May 2022 and Qualcomm acquired Veonner in 2022. In addition, MaxLinear, Inc. announced plans to acquire Silicon Motion in May 2022 and Broadcom announced plans to acquire VMware in May 2022. Consolidation among our competitors has led, and in the future could lead, to a changing competitive landscape, capabilities and market share, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our results of operations.\nOur gross margin and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our average selling prices of products over time, shifts in our product mix, or price increases of certain components or third-party services due to inflation, supply chain constraints, or for other reasons.\nThe products we develop and sell are primarily used for high-volume applications. While prices of our products have increased recently due to inflation and additional costs resulting from securing an increase in supply, the prices of our products have historically decreased. We expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In addition, our more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production expenses. Therefore, over time, we may not be able to maintain or improve our gross margins. Our financial results could suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by other cost reductions through efficiencies, introduction of higher margin products and other means.\nTo attract new customers or retain existing customers, we may offer certain price concessions to certain customers, which could cause our average selling prices and gross margins to decline. In the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or by our competitors and other factors. We expect to continue to have to reduce prices of existing products in the future. Moreover, because of the wide price differences across the markets we serve, the mix and types of performance capabilities of our products sold may affect the average selling prices of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin. We may enter new markets in which a significant amount of competition exists, and this may require us to sell our products with lower gross margins than we earn in our established businesses. If we are successful in growing revenue in these markets, our overall gross margin may decline. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product, and as a result may harm our financial results.\nAdditionally, because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly, testing or packaging facilities, we are not able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase, which could also reduce our gross margins. Our gross margin could also be impacted for example by the following factors: increased costs (including increased costs caused by tariffs, inflation, higher interest rates, or supply chain constraints); loss of cost savings if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either our manufacturers partners or our suppliers deteriorates; excess inventory, or inventory holding and obsolescence charges. In addition, we are subject to risks from fluctuating market prices of certain components, which are incorporated into our products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our products. Supplies of these components may from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions such as inflation or supply chain constraints have in the past affected and may in the future affect pricing of such commodities. For example, during the first few quarters of fiscal year 2023 supply shortages in the semiconductor industry of multi-layer complex substrates, IC packaging capacity and fab constraints resulted in increased lead times, inability to meet demand, and increased costs. Any increase in the price of components used in our products will adversely affect our gross margins.\nEntry into new markets, such as markets with different business models, as a result of our acquisitions may reduce our gross margin and operating margin. For example, for certain products we use an ASIC model to offer end-to-end solutions for intellectual property, design team, fab and packaging to deliver a tested, yielded product to customers. This business model tends to have a lower gross margin. In addition, the costs related to this type of business model typically include significant NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs that customers pay based on the completion of milestones. Our operating margin may decline if our customers do not agree to pay for NREs, if they do not pay enough to cover the costs we incur in connection with NREs, or non-payment of previously agreed NRE costs. In addition, our operating margin may decline if we are unable to sell products in sufficient volumes to cover the development costs that we have incurred. In addition, the ASIC business model requires us to use third-party intellectual property and we may lose business or experience reputational harm if third parties, including customers, lose confidence in our ability to protect their intellectual property rights. With respect to risks related to our use of third-party intellectual property, see also, \u201cWe have been named as a party to several legal proceedings and may be named in additional ones in the future, including litigation involving our patents and other intellectual property, which could subject us to liability, require us to indemnify our customers, require us to obtain or renew licenses, require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.\u201d\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC\nWe face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic which has, and may continue in the future to, significantly disrupt and adversely impact our manufacturing, research and development, operations, sales and financial results.\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemics. In addition to global and domestic macroeconomic effects, during fiscal years 2022 and 2023 the COVID-19 pandemic and related adverse public health measures caused disruption to our global operations and sales. Our third-party manufacturing partners, suppliers, distributors, sub-contractors and customers have been, and may continue to be, disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on their employees\u2019 ability to work; office and factory closures; disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure; border closures; and other travel or health-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing, assembling, testing, and packaging activities or the operations of our manufacturing partners, suppliers, distributors, sub-contractors and customers, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments will be delayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations and customer relationships.\nAlthough the pandemic related restrictions above have eased in many places, the ongoing pandemic, including large outbreaks, resurgences of COVID-19 in various regions and appearances of new variants of the virus, has resulted, and may continue to result, in their full or partial reinstitution. In addition, although many countries have vaccinated large segments of their population, during fiscal year 2023 COVID-19 continued to disrupt business activities, trade, and supply chains in many countries. We expect lingering impacts related to COVID-19 to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, we were impacted by COVID outbreaks in Asia during the first half of fiscal 2023 that resulted in closed factories, clogged ports and a shortage of workers as officials imposed lockdowns and mass testing requirements.\nIn addition to operational and customer impacts, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, (and future pandemics are expected to have) a significant impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries including an economic downturn, which has affected and may in the future affect demand for our products and impact our operating results in both the near and long term. There can be no assurance that any decreases in sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic (or any future pandemic) will be offset by increased sales in subsequent periods.\nOur ongoing efforts to manage these and other potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (and any impacts of future pandemics) may be unsuccessful. As the COVID-19 pandemic reaches endemic stages, due to the continued uncertainty regarding its severity and duration (including resurgences or mutations of the virus), related public health measures and macroeconomic impacts, at this time we are unable to predict its full impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE COMPANY AND WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 needs or in an efficient manner, which could harm our operating results.\nOver the last few years, we have rapidly increased in size. As a result, we have had to, and expect in the future to continue to need to, appropriately scale our business, internal systems and organization, and to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, to serve our growing customer base. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will likely be expensive and complex, requiring management\u2019s time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies, reduced productivity or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our business. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our business operations will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. Any failure of, or delay in, these efforts could negatively impact performance our financial results.\nRecent, current and potential future acquisitions, strategic investments, divestitures, mergers or joint ventures may subject us to significant risks, any of which could harm our business.\nOur long-term strategy has included in the past, and may continue to include in the future, identifying and acquiring, investing in or merging with suitable companies, or divesting of certain business lines, assets or activities. In particular, over time, we may acquire, make investments in, or merge with providers of product offerings that complement our business or may terminate or dispose of business lines, assets or activities if they are no longer in alignment with our operational strategy and priorities.\nMergers, acquisitions and divestitures include a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges. Given that our resources are limited, any decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or making other capital allocation decisions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives.\nAny acquired business, technology, service or product could significantly underperform relative to our expectations. Our acquisitions may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected, we may impose our business practices that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, each or all of which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill. In addition, the use of our stock to finance an acquisition, will result in an increase in the number of outstanding shares and will reduce the ownership percentage of each of our outstanding stockholders.\nWhen we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction.\nIf we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, these transactions, or parts of these transactions, may fail to be completed due to factors such as: failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; disputes or litigation; or difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction. In addition, such transactions are increasingly being subjected to regulatory review and other burdens, which could delay the closing of any transaction and greatly increase the costs related to such transaction.\nIf we fail to complete a transaction, we may nonetheless have incurred significant expenses in connection with such transaction. Failure to complete a pending transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative perception of us among the investment community.\nIn addition, we used a significant portion of our cash and incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of our acquisition of Inphi, which was completed in fiscal 2022. Our use of cash to fund our acquisitions has reduced our liquidity and may (i) limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and (ii) increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. Furthermore, the financing agreements in connection with our outstanding indebtedness contain negative covenants, limitations on indebtedness, liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers and other fundamental changes. Our ability to comply with these negative covenants can be affected by events beyond our control. Our indebtedness and these negative covenants will also have the effect, among other things, of limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, limiting our flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions. In addition, a breach of the negative covenants could result in an event of default with respect to the indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. See also, \u201cWe are subject to risks related to our debt obligations.\u201d\nFor all these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, divestiture, merger or joint venture could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS\nWe rely on our manufacturing partners for the manufacture, assembly, testing and packaging of our products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested or to be able to fulfill our orders could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing, assembly or packaging facilities and have very limited in-house testing facilities. Therefore, we currently rely on several third-party manufacturing partners to produce our products. We also currently rely on several third-party assembly, testing and packaging subcontractors to assemble, package and test our products. This exposes us to a variety of risks, including the following:\nRegional Concentration\nMost of our products are manufactured by third-party foundries located in Taiwan, and other sources are located in China, Germany, South Korea, Singapore and the United States. In addition, substantially all of our third-party assembly, testing and packaging facilities are located in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Canada. Because of the geographic concentration of these third-party foundries, as well as our assembly, testing and packaging subcontractors, we are exposed to the risk that their operations may be disrupted by regional events including, for example, droughts, earthquakes (particularly in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim close to fault lines), tsunamis or typhoons, severe storms, power outages, or by actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics, or by political, social or economic instability, or by geopolitical tensions and conflicts. For example, we were impacted by COVID outbreaks in Asia in the first half of fiscal 2023 that resulted in closed factories, clogged ports and a shortage of workers as officials imposed lockdowns and mass testing requirements. In the case of such an event, our revenue, cost of goods sold and results of operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, there are limited numbers of alternative foundries capable of producing advanced technologies and identifying and implementing alternative manufacturing facilities would be time consuming. Although there is a movement in the U.S. to build more foundries locally and the U.S. government is providing funds or other incentives for certain companies to do so, we do not expect that such foundries will be available to us to produce advanced technologies any time soon, if ever. If we need to utilize alternate manufacturing facilities, either in Taiwan or elsewhere we could experience significant expenses and delays in product shipments, which could harm our results of operations.\nNo Guarantee of Capacity or Supply\nThe ability of each of our manufacturing partners to provide us with materials and services is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations. When demand is strong, availability of our partners\u2019 capacity may be constrained or not available, and with certain exceptions, our vendors are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities, or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. We place our orders on the basis of our customers\u2019 purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand, and most of our manufacturing partners can allocate capacity to the production of other companies\u2019 products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice. It is possible that their customers that are larger and better financed than we are or that have long-term agreements with our main foundries may induce them to reallocate capacity to those customers. Most of our manufacturing partners may reallocate capacity to their customers offering them a better margin or rate of return than provided by us. This reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturing partners or other suppliers are unable to secure the necessary raw materials from their suppliers, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages or labor shortages, or lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions, which could harm our business or results of operations.\nThere are a very limited number of foundries and consolidation of the foundries that provide services to us or to the semiconductor industry due to bankruptcy or through business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships may adversely impact us. A foundry, supplier or other manufacturing partner could become unavailable to us if it is acquired by a competitor or a large company that may change the scope of the offerings. For example, Intel Corporation announced in February 2022 of its intent to acquire Tower Semiconductor. Or a foundry may not be suitable for us if it does not invest in, or have the ability to manufacture, advanced technologies. In particular, as we and others in our industry transition to smaller geometries, our manufacturing partners may be supply constrained or may charge premiums for these advanced technologies, which may harm our business or results of operations. See also, \u201cWe may experience increased actual and opportunity costs as a result of our transition to smaller geometry process technologies.\u201d In addition, a foundry or supplier may become unavailable to us as a result of economic or political instability. Any disruption to our manufacturing partners could result in a material decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow.\nWe have in the past including in the first few quarters of fiscal year 2023, and may in the future, experience a number of industry-wide supply constraints affecting the type of high complexity products we provide for data infrastructure. These supply constraints have impacted, and are expected in the future to impact, the kitting process for our products. These supply challenges have in the past, and may in the future, limit our ability to fully satisfy the increase in demand for some of our products.\nWhile we attempt to create multiple sources for our products, most of our products are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time, and our products typically are designed to be manufactured in a specific process at only one of these foundries. Accordingly, if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed, it would be difficult for us to transition the manufacture of our products to other foundries, and we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components. Any disruption to our or foundry partners could result in a material decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow. In addition, our assembly testing and packaging partners may be single sourced and it may be difficult for us to transition to other manufacturing partners for these services.\nIn order to secure sufficient capacity when demand is high and to mitigate the risks described in the foregoing paragraph, we have entered into, and in the future may enter into, various arrangements with certain manufacturing partners or other suppliers that could be costly and harm our results of operations, such as nonrefundable deposits with, or loans to, such parties in exchange for capacity commitments, or contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of components over extended periods. We may not be able to make such arrangements in a timely fashion or at all, and any arrangements may be costly, reduce our financial flexibility, and not be on terms favorable to us. Moreover, if we are able to secure capacity, we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties. These penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results.\nDuring the first few quarters of fiscal year 2023, supply shortages in the semiconductor industry of multi-layer complex substrates, IC packaging capacity, and specific wafer process node constraints resulted in increased lead times, inability to meet demand, and increased costs. Of these shortages, ABF substrates and specific wafer process nodes were the most constrained and most of these suppliers are located in Japan and Taiwan. Because of the geographic concentration of these suppliers, we are exposed to the risk that their operations may be disrupted by regional events including droughts, earthquakes (particularly in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim close to fault lines), tsunamis or typhoons, severe storms, power outages, or by actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or by political, social or economic instability. In addition, while the Russian invasion of Ukraine has not had a direct material impact on us due to our limited sales to Russia and Ukraine, we are unable to predict the indirect impact this conflict will have on us due to impacts on the supply chain, global and domestic economies, interest rates and stock markets.\nUncertain Yields and Quality\nThe fabrication of our products is a complex and technically demanding process. Our technology is transitioning from planar to FINFET transistors. This transition may result in longer qualification cycles and lower yields. Our manufacturing partners have from time to time experienced manufacturing defects and lower manufacturing yields, which are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our foundries could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance. In addition, we may face lower manufacturing yields and reduced quality in the process of ramping up and diversifying our manufacturing partners. Poor yields from our partners, or defects, integration issues or other performance problems with our products could cause us significant customer relations and business reputation problems, harm our financial performance and result in financial or other damages to our customers. Our customers could also seek damages in connection with product liability claims, which would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. In addition, defects could result in significant costs. See also, \u201cCosts related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.\u201d\nBecause we rely on outside manufacturing partners, we have a reduced ability to directly control product delivery schedules and quality assurance, which has in the past and may in the future result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that delay shipments or increase costs.\nCommodity Prices\nWe are also subject to risk from increasing or fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, including gold and copper, which are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our end products. Supplies for such commodities have from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions have in the past affected and may in the future affect pricing of such commodities (such as inflation or supply chain constraints).\nWe may experience increased actual and opportunity costs as a result of our transition to smaller geometry process technologies.\nIn order to remain competitive, we have transitioned, and expect to continue to transition, our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies. We also evaluate the costs of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies including both actual costs such as increased mask costs and wafer costs and increased costs related to EDA tools and the opportunity costs related to the technologies we choose to forego. These transitions are imperative for us to be competitive with the rest of the industry and to target some of our product development in high growth areas to these advanced nodes, which has resulted in significant initial design and development costs.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, dependent on our relationships with our manufacturing partners to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot ensure that the partners we use will be able to effectively manage any future transitions. In addition, there are a very limited number of foundries capable of producing advanced technologies, and identifying and implementing alternative manufacturing facilities would be time consuming. If we or any of our partners experience significant delays in a future transition or fail to efficiently implement a transition, we could experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses, all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations.\nAs smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, if at all. Moreover, even if we are able to achieve higher levels of design integration, such integration may have a short-term adverse impact on our results of operations, as we may reduce our revenue by integrating the functionality of multiple chips into a single chip.\nWe rely on our customers to design our products into their systems, and the nature of the design process requires us to incur expenses prior to customer commitments to use our products or recognizing revenues associated with those expenses which may adversely affect our financial results.\nOne of our primary focuses is on winning competitive bid selection processes, known as \u201cdesign wins,\u201d to develop products for use in our customers\u2019 products. We devote significant time and resources in working with our customers\u2019 system designers to understand their future needs and to provide products that we believe will meet those needs and these bid selection processes can be lengthy. If a customer\u2019s system designer initially chooses a competitor\u2019s product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products for use in that system because changing suppliers can involve significant cost, time, effort and risk for our customers. Thus, our failure to win a competitive bid can result in our foregoing revenues from a given customer\u2019s product line for the life of that product. In addition, design opportunities may be infrequent or delayed. Our ability to compete in the future will depend, in large part, on our ability to design products to ensure compliance with our customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 specifications. We expect to invest significant time and resources and to incur significant expenses to design our products to ensure compliance with relevant specifications.\nWe often incur significant expenditures in the development of a new product without any assurance that our customers\u2019 system designers will select our product for use in their applications. We often are required to anticipate which product designs will generate demand in advance of our customers expressly indicating a need for that particular design. Even if our customers\u2019 system designers select our products, a substantial period of time will elapse before we generate revenues related to the significant expenses we have incurred.\nThe reasons for this delay generally include the following elements of our product sales and development cycle timeline and related influences:\n\u2022our customers usually require a comprehensive technical evaluation of our products before they incorporate them into their designs;\n\u2022it can take from six months to three years from the time our products are selected to commence commercial shipments; and\n\u2022our customers may experience changed market conditions or product development issues.\nThe resources devoted to product development and sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us, and from time to time, we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory if we have produced product in anticipation of expected demand. We may spend resources on the development of products that our customers may not adopt. If we incur significant expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those expenses, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory, our operating results would be harmed.\nAdditionally, even if system designers use our products in their systems, we cannot assure you that these systems will be commercially successful or that we will receive significant revenue from the sales of our products for those systems. As a result, we may be unable to accurately forecast the volume and timing of our orders and revenues associated with any new product introductions.\nWe have in the past, and may continue to, make custom or semi-custom products on an exclusive basis for some of our customers for a negotiated period of time. The percentage of our sales related to custom or semi-custom products has been increasing over the last few years. Any revenue from sales of our custom or semi-custom products is directly related to sales of the third-party customer\u2019s products and reflective of their success in the market. We have no control over the marketing efforts of these third-party customers and can\u2019t make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. In addition, if these customers are bought by our competitors or other third parties, they may terminate agreements related to these custom or semi-custom products or otherwise limit our access to technology necessary for the production of these products. As a result, there may be no other customers for these products due to their custom or semi-custom nature. Consequently, we may not fully realize our expectations for custom or semi-custom product revenue and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, failure of our customers to agree to pay for NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs or failure to pay enough to cover the costs we incur in connection with NREs, or non-payment of previously agreed NRE costs due to us, can harm our financial results. See also, \u201cResearch and Development\u201d under Results of Operations.\nIf we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products that address customer requirements, in a timely and cost-effective manner and are competitive as to a variety of factors. For example, we must successfully identify customer requirements and design, develop and produce products on time that compete effectively as to price, functionality and performance. We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries.\nIn addition, the development of new semiconductor solutions is highly complex and, due to a variety of factors, including supply chain cross-dependencies, dependencies on EDA and similar tools, dependencies on the use of third party, business partner or customer intellectual property, collaboration and synchronization requirements with business partners and customers, requirements to establish new manufacturing, testing, assembly and packing processes, and other factors, we may experience delays in completing the design, development, production and introduction of our new products. Any delays could result in increased development costs, hurt our customer relationships including our ability to win new designs, resulting in lost potential future revenue, or impact our ability to allocate resources to other projects. See also, \u201cWe rely on our manufacturing partners for the manufacture, assembly, testing and packaging of our products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business\u201d for additional information on the impacts of supply chain cross-dependencies on our business.\nOur ability to adapt to changes and to anticipate future standards, and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards, will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth. We may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards. Our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the markets they serve and to introduce and promote those products successfully and in a timely manner. Even if we and our customers introduce new and enhanced products to the market, those products may not achieve market acceptance.\nSome of our customers require our products and our third-party manufacturing partners to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process which does not assure product sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying these products with a customer, our business and operating results would suffer.\nPrior to purchasing our products, some of our customers require that both our products and our third-party manufacturing partners undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of our products in the customers\u2019 systems, as well as testing for reliability. This qualification process can take several months and qualification of a product by a customer does not assure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision in our third party manufacturing partners\u2019 process or our selection of a new supplier may require a new qualification process with our customers, which may result in delays and in our holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take several months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or systems that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying these products with a customer, sales of the products to the customer may be precluded or delayed, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer.\nCosts related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe make highly complex semiconductor solutions and, accordingly, there is a risk of defects in our products. Such defects can give rise to the significant costs noted below. Moreover, since the cost of replacing defective products is often much higher than the value of the products themselves, we are subject to damage claims from customers in excess of the amounts they pay us for our products, including consequential damages. We also face exposure to potential liability resulting from the fact that our customers typically integrate the semiconductor solutions we sell into numerous consumer products, including automobiles. We are exposed to product liability claims if our semiconductor solutions or the consumer products integrated with our semiconductor solutions (such as automobiles), malfunction and lead to personal injury or death. In addition, our customers may issue recalls on their products if they prove to be defective or make compensatory payments in accordance with industry or business practice or in order to maintain good customer relationships. If such recalls or payments are the result of a defect in one of our products, our customers may seek to recover all or a portion of their losses from us. Recalls of our customers\u2019 products in certain end-markets, such as with our automotive and base station customers, may cause us to incur significant costs.\nIn addition, despite our testing procedures, we cannot ensure that errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future. Such errors could result in:\n\u2022loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022material recall and replacement costs;\n\u2022delay in revenue recognition or loss of revenue;\n\u2022writing down the inventory of defective products;\n\u2022the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts;\n\u2022our having to defend against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury; and\n\u2022damage to our reputation in the industry that could adversely affect our relationships with our customers.\nIn addition, the process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources. We may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field, which may cause us to incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and further reputational harm. Any of these problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nDespite our best efforts, security vulnerabilities may exist with respect to our products. Mitigation techniques designed to address such security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, may not operate as intended or effectively resolve such vulnerabilities. Software and firmware updates and/or other mitigation efforts may result in performance issues, system instability, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, or the theft of data by third parties, any of which could significantly harm our business and reputation. See also, \u201cWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.\u201d\nWe rely on third-party distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales\nFrom time to time, we enter into relationships with distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives to sell our products, and we are unable to predict the extent to which these partners will be successful in marketing and selling our products. Moreover, many of our distributors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives also market and sell competing products, and may terminate their relationships with us at any time. Our future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers\u2019 representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products. If we cannot retain or attract distributors or manufacturers\u2019 representatives, or if any of our distributors or manufacturer\u2019s representatives are unsuccessful in marketing and selling our products or terminate their relationships with us, our sales and results of operations will be harmed.\nWE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS\nAdverse changes in the political and economic policies of the U.S. government in connection with trade with China and Chinese customers have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business.\nRegulatory activity, such as tariffs, export controls, economic sanctions and vigorous enforcement of U.S. export controls and economic sanctions laws have in the past and may continue to materially limit our ability to make sales to our significant customers in China, which has in the past and may continue to harm our results of operations, reputation and financial condition. For example, addition of companies to the Entity List, which places export restrictions on certain foreign persons or entities by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, has dampened demand for our products, adding to the already challenging macroeconomic environment. Due to the U.S. government restricting sales to certain customers in China, sales to some of our customers require licenses in order for us to export our products; however, in the past some of these licenses have been denied and there can be no assurances that requests for future licenses will be approved by the U.S. government. Moreover, concerns that U.S. companies may not be reliable suppliers as a result of these and other actions has caused, and may in the future cause, some of our customers in China to amass large inventories of our products well in advance of need or caused some of our customers to replace our products in favor of products from other suppliers. As a result, the Chinese government adopted a law with respect to unreliable suppliers. Being designated as an unreliable supplier would have an adverse impact on our business and operations. In addition, there may be indirect impacts to our business that we cannot easily quantify such as the fact that some of our other customers\u2019 products may also be impacted by export restrictions. In addition, any customers in China that are subject to trade restrictions or tariffs, may develop their own products or solutions instead of purchasing from us or they may acquire products or solutions from our competitors or other third-party sources that are not subject to the U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions. If export restrictions related to Chinese customers are sustained for a long period of time, or increased, or if other export restrictions are imposed, it will have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nIn addition, companies in the semiconductor industry, including us, have been impacted by rules and regulations related to business activities in China, or other locations, due to concerns that semiconductors are necessary for U.S. national security, manufacturing and critical infrastructure, and compliance with these rules and regulations may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. For example, in February 2022, the U.S. National Science and Technology Council published an updated list of critical and emerging technologies, which includes semiconductors, as part of an ongoing effort to identify advanced technologies that are potentially significant to U.S. national security, which could result in more stringent export controls or a greater number of our products requiring a license for export to China. In addition, in October 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security released new controls on the export of advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing items to China as well as transactions related to supercomputer end-uses in China with the aim of addressing U.S. national security and foreign policy concerns. The regulations published in October 2022 include new restrictions on U.S. persons with respect to activities that are not subject to the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), which differs from the agency\u2019s historical approach of controlling items that are subject to the EAR, and could further restrict our engagement in the China market.\nMost of our products are manufactured by third-party foundries located in Taiwan. As we have a significant amount of sales into China, we may be adversely impacted by export restrictions, labeling requirements or other trade related issues or disputes, or political conflicts or tensions between China and Taiwan as these restrictions and requirements could impact or delay the delivery of our products to our customers in China.\nWe typically sell products to customers in China pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments. Some customers in China may be able to cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a penalty and, therefore, they may be more likely to do so while the tariffs and trade restrictions are in effect. See also, the Risk Factor entitled \u201cWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet that demand or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet that demand, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.\u201d\nChanges to U.S. or foreign tax, trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign international tax, social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business. For example, while the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including related export and other business sanctions on Russia) has not had a material impact on us due to our limited sales to Russia and Ukraine, we are unable to predict the indirect impact this conflict will have on us through impacts to the supply chain, the global and domestic economies, interest rates or stock markets. The U.S. government has in the past, and may in the future, instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that included the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. Any new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods.\nIn addition, the U.S. government has in the past, and may in the future, adopted policies that discourage corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which required us to change the way we conduct business. Political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies and resulting changes to trade, tax or other laws and policies may be disruptive to our businesses. These changes in U.S. and foreign laws and policies have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also, \u201cAdverse changes in the political and economic policies of the U.S. government in connection with trade with China have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business\u201d and \"Changes in existing taxation benefits, rules or practices may adversely affect our financial results.\u201d\nWe face additional risks due to the extent of our global operations since a majority of our products, and those of many of our customers, are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. The occurrence of any or a combination of the additional risks described below would significantly and negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the United States and, as a result, we are subject to foreign business, political and economic risks. Most of our products are manufactured by our manufacturing partners outside of the United States. Most of our current qualified integrated circuit foundries are located in the same region within Taiwan. In addition, our primary assembly, testing and packaging subcontractors are located in the Pacific Rim region. For example, a substantial amount of our revenue is derived from products manufactured in Taiwan and as a result, disruptions to business in Taiwan, whether political, military, natural disasters or other events will adversely impact our business. In addition, many of our customers are located outside of the United States, primarily in Asia, which further exposes us to foreign risks. Sales shipped to customers with operations in Asia represented approximately 75% and 78% of our net revenue in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\nWe also have substantial operations outside of the United States. We anticipate that our manufacturing, assembly, testing, packaging and sales outside of the United States will continue to account for a substantial portion of our operations and revenue in future periods.\nAccordingly, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, employees, customers and suppliers;\n\u2022political, social and economic instability, military hostilities including invasions, wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022volatile global economic conditions, including downturns or recessions in which some competitors may become more aggressive in their pricing practices, which would adversely impact our gross margin;\n\u2022compliance with domestic and foreign export and import regulations, including pending changes thereto, and difficulties in obtaining and complying with domestic and foreign export, import and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022local laws and practices that favor local companies, including business practices that are prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing, managing or closing foreign operations;\n\u2022natural disasters or other events, including droughts or other water shortages, earthquakes, fires, tsunamis and floods, or power outages;\n\u2022trade restrictions, higher tariffs, worsening trade relationship between the United States and China, or changes in cross border taxation, particularly in light of the tariffs imposed by the U.S. government;\n\u2022transportation and port related delays;\n\u2022difficulties in obtaining, managing or terminating foreign distributors;\n\u2022less effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the United States or other developed countries;\n\u2022inadequate local infrastructure; and\n\u2022exposure to local banking, currency control and other financial-related risks.\nAs a result of having global operations, the sudden disruption of the supply chain and/or disruption of the manufacture of our customer\u2019s products caused by events outside of our control has in the past and may in the future impact our results of operations by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products. See also, \u201cWe rely on our manufacturing partners for the manufacture, assembly, testing and packaging of our products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested or to be able to fulfill our orders could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business.\u201d\nMoreover, the international nature of our business subjects us to risk associated with the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus currencies in jurisdictions where we have large fixed costs, or where our third-party manufacturing partners have significant costs, will increase the cost of such operations which could harm our results of operations. In addition, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.\nCHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME\nChanges in existing taxation benefits, tax rules or tax practices may adversely affect our financial results.\nAs a result of the closing of our transaction with Inphi, we are now domiciled in the United States and not Bermuda. Therefore, the income from all foreign subsidiaries is now subject to the U.S. provisions applicable to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d), which generally requires GILTI income to be included in the taxable income of U.S. entities. The U.S. currently has a federal corporate tax rate of 21%. President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIRA\u201d) on August 16, 2022 and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 on August 9, 2022.These laws implement new tax provisions and provide for various incentives and tax credits. The IRA applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 and introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income for any consecutive three-tax-year period preceding the tax year exceeds $1 billion and a 1% excise tax on certain stock repurchases made by publicly traded U.S. corporations after December 31, 2022. While we are not currently expecting a material impact on our business by the new taxes under the IRA if we become subject to these taxes in the future it could materially affect our financial results, including our earnings and cash flow.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \u201cOECD\u201d) has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and since 2015 has been issuing guidelines and proposals with respect to various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in the countries in which we do business. In 2021, the OECD announced that more than 140 member jurisdictions (including the United States, Singapore, and Bermuda) have politically committed to potential changes to the international corporate tax system, including enacting a minimum tax rate of at least 15%. During December 2022, the European Union reached agreement on the introduction of a minimum tax directive requiring member states to enact local legislation. Such proposed changes have not generally been enacted into law in most of the primary jurisdictions in which we operate. We will continue to monitor countries\u2019 laws with respect to the OECD model rules with respect to a global minimum tax. We calculate our income taxes based on currently enacted laws. Because of increasing focus by government taxing authorities on multinational companies, the tax laws of certain countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could increase our liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties, and could materially adversely impact our financial results, including our earnings and cash flow.\nIn addition, in prior years, we entered into incentive agreements in certain foreign jurisdictions that provide for reduced tax rates in such jurisdictions if certain criteria are met. During the three months ended April 30, 2022, the Singapore Economic Development Board agreed to extend our Development and Expansion Incentive by five years until June 30, 2029. In addition, under the Israeli Encouragement law of \u201capproved or benefited enterprise,\u201d our subsidiary in Israel, Marvell Israel (M.I.S.L) Ltd., is entitled to reduced tax rates and exemption of certain income from taxation through fiscal 2027. Receipt of past and future benefits under tax agreements and incentives may depend on several factors, including but not limited to, our ability to fulfill commitments regarding employment of personnel, investment, or performance of specified activities in the applicable jurisdictions as well as changes in foreign laws. Changes in our business plans, including divestitures, could result in termination of an agreement or loss of tax benefits thereunder. If any of our tax agreements in any of these foreign jurisdictions were terminated, our results of operations and our financial position could be harmed.\nIn addition, in prior periods, we transferred certain intellectual property to a related entity in Singapore. The impact to us was based on our determination of the fair value of this property, which required management to make significant estimates and to apply complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. In future periods, local tax authorities may challenge our valuations of these assets, which could reduce our expected tax benefits from these transactions.\nOur profitability and effective tax rate could be impacted by unexpected changes to our statutory income tax rates or income tax liabilities. Such changes could result from various items, including changes in tax laws or regulations, changes to court or administrative interpretations of tax laws, changes to our geographic mix of earnings, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, discrete items, changes in our supply chain, and changes due to audit assessments. In particular, the tax benefits associated with our transfer of intellectual property to Singapore are sensitive to our future profitability and taxable income in Singapore, audit assessments, and changes in applicable tax law. Our current corporate effective tax rate fluctuates significantly from period to period, and is based on the application of currently applicable income tax laws, regulations and treaties, as well as current judicial and administrative interpretations of these income tax laws, regulations and treaties, in various jurisdictions.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO OUR ASSETS\nWe are exposed to potential impairment charges on certain assets.\nWe had approximately $11.6 billion of goodwill and $5.1 billion of acquired intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2023. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we are required to review our intangible assets including goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment annually on the last business day of our fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or we may determine to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.\nFactors we consider important in the qualitative assessment which could trigger a goodwill impairment review include: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value.\nWe assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to the following: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. For example, if the operations of any businesses that we have acquired declines significantly, we could incur significant intangible asset impairment charges.\nFor example, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we made changes to the scope of our server processor product line in response to changes in the associated market. We transitioned our product offering from standard server processors to the broad server market to focus only on customized server processors for a few targeted customers. This change in strategy required us to assess whether the carrying value of the associated assets would be recoverable. As a result of the assessment, we determined the carrying amount of certain impacted assets are not recoverable, which resulted in recognition of $119.0 million of restructuring related charges associated with the server processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. See \u201cNote 10 - Restructuring\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nWe have determined that our business operates as a single operating segment and has a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by taking our market capitalization as determined through quoted market prices and as adjusted for a control premium and other relevant factors. If our fair value declines to below our carrying value, we could incur significant goodwill impairment charges, which could negatively impact our financial results. If in the future a change in our organizational structure results in more than one reporting unit, we will be required to allocate our goodwill and perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment in each reporting unit. As a result, we could have an impairment of goodwill in one or more of such future reporting units.\nIn addition, from time to time, we have made investments in private companies. If the companies that we invest in are unable to execute their plans and succeed in their respective markets, we may not benefit from such investments, and we could potentially lose the amounts we invest. We evaluate our investment portfolio on a regular basis to determine if impairments have occurred. Impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations in any period.\nWe are subject to the risks of owning real property.\nOur buildings in Santa Clara, California and Shanghai, China subject us to the risks of owning real property, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with remediating any environmental problems;\n\u2022adverse changes in the value of these properties due to economic conditions, the movement by many companies to a full time work from home or a hybrid work environment, interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors;\n\u2022the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning, seismic and other legal or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the potential disruption of our business and operations arising from or connected with a relocation due to moving or to renovating the facility;\n\u2022increased cash commitments for improvements to the buildings or the property, or both;\n\u2022increased operating expenses for the buildings or the property, or both;\n\u2022possible disputes with third parties related to the buildings or the property, or both;\n\u2022failure to achieve expected cost savings due to extended non-occupancy of a vacated property intended to be leased; and\n\u2022the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance, or uninsured risks, such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of earthquakes, floods and/or other natural disasters.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.\nWe believe one of our key competitive advantages results from the collection of proprietary technologies we have developed and acquired since our inception, and the protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to be, important to the success of our business. If we fail to protect these intellectual property rights, competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed, which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenue.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements, licenses and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, manufacturing or other business partners, and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information. Notwithstanding these agreements, we have experienced disputes with employees regarding ownership of intellectual property in the past. To the extent that any third party has a claim to ownership of any relevant technologies used in our products, we may not be able to recognize the full revenue stream from such relevant technologies. See also, \u201cWe have been named as a party to several legal proceedings and may be named in additional ones in the future, including litigation involving our patents and other intellectual property, which could subject us to liability, require us to indemnify our customers, require us to obtain or renew licenses, require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.\u201d\nWe have been issued a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and have a significant number of pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. However, a patent may not be issued as a result of any applications or, if issued, claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We may also be required to license some of our patents to others including competitors as a result of our participation in and contribution to development of industry standards. Despite our efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or proprietary technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and the steps that we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in jurisdictions where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States or other developed countries. If our patents do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our confidential information including our intellectual property. Despite our efforts, we may be subject to breach of these security systems and controls which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and labs and/or unauthorized use or theft of the confidential information and intellectual property we are trying to protect. See also, \u201cCyber security risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations.\u201d If we fail to protect these intellectual property rights, competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed, which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenue.\nCertain of our software, as well as that of our customers, may be derived from so-called \u201copen source\u201d software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Open source software is made available under licenses that impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license we customarily use to protect our intellectual property. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software, in the event that the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work if the license is terminated which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we license technology from Arm Limited that is included in a majority of our products and would be adversely impacted if the pricing for, or availability of, the relevant technology is changed in an adverse manner.\nWe must comply with a variety of existing and future laws and regulations, as well as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives, that could impose substantial costs on us and may adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: intellectual property ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; conflict minerals; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health and safety requirements; securities registration laws; and consumer laws. For example, government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products. If we fail to continue to receive licenses or otherwise comply with these regulations, we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at foreign foundries or ship these products to certain customers, or we may incur penalties or fines. In addition, we are subject to various industry requirements restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws and regulations. Our compliance programs rely in part on compliance by our manufacturing partners, suppliers, vendors and distributors. To the extent such third parties don\u2019t comply with these obligations our business, operations and reputation may be adversely impacted. If we violate or fail to comply with any of the above requirements, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. The costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of any investigations, auditing and monitoring) could adversely affect our current or future business.\nOur product or manufacturing standards could also be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives. For example, a significant portion of our revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China\u2019s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements.\nIncreasingly regulators (including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters. While we have certain ESG initiatives at the Company there can be no assurance that regulators, customers, investors, and employees will determine that these programs are sufficiently robust. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish our announced goals related to our ESG program, as statements regarding our ESG goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them within the timelines we announce or at all. Actual or perceived shortcomings with respect to our ESG initiatives, including our diversity initiatives, and reporting can impact our ability to hire and retain employees, increase our customer base, reelect our board of directors, or attract and retain certain types of investors. In addition, these parties are increasing focused on specific disclosures and frameworks related to ESG matters. Collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming, is subject to evolving reporting standards, and can present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material impact on us, including on our reputation and stock price. Inadequate processes to collect and review this information prior to disclosure could subject us to potential liability related to such information.\nA portion of the business we acquired in fiscal 2021 requires facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence (\u201cFOCI\u201d). Because we were organized in Bermuda at the time of this acquisition, we entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense with respect to FOCI mitigation arrangements that relate to our operation of the portion of the business involving facility clearances. These measures and arrangements may materially and adversely affect our operating results due to the increased cost of compliance with these measures. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected. Now that we are domiciled in the United States, we have requested to be released from some of the above FOCI-related obligations. We can offer no assurance that such a request will be granted in a timely manner or at all.\nWe are a party to certain contracts with the U.S. government or its subcontractors. Our contracts with the U.S. government or its subcontractors are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Any of these risks related to contracting with the U.S. government or its subcontractors could adversely impact our future sales and operating results.\nWe have been named as a party to several legal proceedings and may be named in additional ones in the future, including litigation involving our patents and other intellectual property, which could subject us to liability, require us to indemnify our customers, require us to obtain or renew licenses, require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.\nWe are currently, and have been in the past, named as a party to several lawsuits, government inquiries or investigations and other legal proceedings (referred to as \u201clitigation\u201d), and we may be named in additional litigation in the future. Please see \u201cNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of any material litigation matters in which we may be currently engaged.\nIn particular, litigation involving patents and other intellectual property is widespread in the high-technology industry and is particularly prevalent in the semiconductor industry, where a number of companies and other entities aggressively bring numerous infringement claims to assert their patent portfolios. The amount of damages alleged in intellectual property infringement claims can often be very significant. See also, \u201cWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.\u201d\nFrom time to time, we receive and our customers receive, and we and our customers may continue to receive in the future, standards-based or other types of infringement claims, as well as claims against us and our proprietary technologies. These claims could result in litigation and/or claims for indemnification, which, in turn, could subject us to significant liability for damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022stop selling, offering for sale, making, having made or exporting products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property;\n\u2022limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for us;\n\u2022pay substantial damages and/or license fees and/or royalties to the party claiming infringement or other license violations that could adversely impact our liquidity or operating results;\n\u2022attempt to obtain or renew licenses to the relevant intellectual property, which licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; and\n\u2022attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property.\nUnder certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses for current and former directors and officers. See also, \u201cOur indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d Additionally, from time to time, we have agreed to indemnify select customers for claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, patents, registered trademarks and/or copyrights. If we are required to make a significant payment under any of our indemnification obligations, our results of operations may be harmed.\nThe ultimate outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time consuming, expensive, and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, may result in significant expenditures, diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business and damage to our reputation or relationship with third parties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe paid the cash portion of the consideration for the Inphi acquisition and other fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the transaction from cash on hand and borrowings. On the closing date of the Inphi acquisition, the entire principal amount was funded and incurred in respect of the $1.75 billion senior unsecured term loan facility, comprised of a $875.0 million 3-year term loan tranche (the \u201c3-Year Tranche Loan\u201d) and a $875.0 million 5-year term loan tranche (the \u201c5-Year Tranche Loan,\u201d and collectively with the 3-Year Tranche Loan, the \u201c2024 and 2026 Term Loans\u201d). The 2024 and 2026 Term Loans are evidenced by a credit agreement, dated December 7, 2020 (the \u201c2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement\u201d). As of January 28, 2023, the Company had a balance of $1.5 billion on the term loan facility. In addition to the 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement, on December 7, 2020, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (\u201c2020 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and together with the 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement, the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d), which provides for a $750.0 million revolving credit facility. As of January 28, 2023, the revolving credit facility is undrawn.\nOn April 12, 2021, we completed a private offering of (i) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Senior Notes, (ii) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Senior Notes and (iii) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2031 Senior Notes (collectively, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). In addition, on May 4, 2021, we completed a private exchange offer where we exchanged most of the notes issued by Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (collectively, the \u201cMTG Senior Notes\u201d) for $433.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Senior Notes and $479.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Senior Notes issued by us (the \u201cMTI Senior Notes\u201d) (together with the Senior Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d). As of January 28, 2023, we had $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding and $913.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the MTI Senior Notes outstanding and $86.7 million aggregate principal amount of the MTG Senior Notes outstanding. On October 8, 2021 and December 16, 2021, we completed registered exchange offers for each series of Notes. The terms of the new notes issued in the exchange offers are substantially identical to the Notes, except that the new notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the transfer restrictions and registration rights applicable to the Notes do not apply to the new notes.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to us including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n\u2022exposing us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness, particularly in the current environment of rising interest rates; and\n\u2022making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes.\nAlthough the Credit Agreements contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the indentures governing the Notes (together, the \u201cNotes Indentures\u201d) contain restrictions on creating liens and entering into certain sale-leaseback transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness, liens or sale-leaseback transactions incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nThe Credit Agreements, the Notes Indentures and the indenture governing the MTI Senior Notes contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, after any applicable grace period, the lenders would have the ability to immediately declare the loans due and payable in whole or in part. In such event, we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due, or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes to our debt ratings could negatively affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. The applicable margins with respect to the loans incurred under the Credit Agreements will vary based on the applicable public ratings assigned to the indebtedness by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, Fitch\u2019s and any successor to each such rating agency business. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of current or future debt and may adversely affect our share price.\nThe Credit Agreements and the Notes Indentures impose restrictions on our business.\nThe Credit Agreements and the Notes Indentures each contains a number of covenants imposing restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions, among other things, restrict our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to create or incur certain liens, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other companies, pay dividends, transfer or sell assets and make restricted payments. These restrictions are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreements and the Notes Indentures. Our ability to meet the leverage ratio set forth in the Credit Agreements may be affected by events beyond our control.\nThe foregoing restrictions could limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in market conditions or our capital needs. We do not know whether we will be granted waivers under, or amendments to, our Credit Agreements or to the Notes Indentures if for any reason we are unable to meet these requirements, or whether we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may be unable to generate the cash flow to service our debt obligations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the Notes, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt obligations, refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt (including the Notes) or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under SEC guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us, potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration.\nWe may, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase the Notes at the option of the holder.\nWe will be required to repurchase the Notes at the option of each holder upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event as defined in the Notes Indentures. However, we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Notes in cash at the time of any change of control repurchase event. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control repurchase event would be an event of default under the Notes Indentures and could cause a cross-default or acceleration under the Credit Agreements and certain future agreements governing our other indebtedness. The repayment obligations under the Notes may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company. If we were required to repurchase the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity, it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBER SECURITY RISKS\nCyber security risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations.\nWe depend heavily on our technology infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. We routinely collect and store sensitive data in our information systems, including intellectual property and other proprietary information about our business and that of our customers, suppliers and manufacturing and other business partners. These information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, destructive or inadequate code, malware, power failures, cyber-attacks, internal malfeasance or other events. Cyber-attacks may include phishing or other forms of social engineering attacks, exploits of code or system configurations, malicious code, such as viruses and worms, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and other actions granting unauthorized access to our technology infrastructure or information systems or those of our customers, suppliers and manufacturing and other business partners. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be the target of email phishing attacks that attempt to acquire personal information or Company assets.\nWe have implemented processes for systems under our control intended to mitigate risks; however, we cannot guarantee that those risk mitigation measures will be effective. We have not experienced a material information security breach in the last three years, and as a result, we have not incurred any net expenses from such a breach. We have not been penalized or paid any amount under an information security breach settlement over the last three years. Further, we annually assess our insurance policy and have determined not to purchase cyber related insurance. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. The risk of state-sponsored or geopolitical-related cyber security incidents has also increased during fiscal 2023 due to geopolitical tensions or incidents, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While we have historically been successful in defending against the cyber-attacks and breaches mentioned above, given the frequency of cyber-attacks and resulting breaches reported by other businesses and governments, it is likely we will experience one or more material breaches of some extent in the future. We have incurred and may in the future incur significant costs in order to implement, maintain and/or update security systems we feel are necessary to protect our information systems, or we may miscalculate the level of investment necessary to protect our systems adequately. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.\nOur business also requires it to share confidential information with manufacturing partners, suppliers and other third parties. Although we take steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures may not always be effective. Immaterial data breaches, losses or other unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information have in the past occurred with third parties and material data breaches, losses or other unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may in the future occur in connection with third parties and could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results and could result in liability or penalties under data privacy laws.\nTo the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions or interruptions to our operations, or those of our customers, suppliers and manufacturing and other business partners, or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to our data or confidential information, including our intellectual property, our reputation, business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe depend on highly skilled personnel to support our business operations. If we are unable to retain and motivate our current personnel or attract additional qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineering, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. We typically do not enter into employment agreements with any of our key personnel and the loss of such personnel could harm our business, as their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. The competition for qualified personnel with significant experience in the management, design, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of semiconductor solutions has been intense over the last few years, both in the Silicon Valley where our U.S. operations are based and in global markets in which we operate. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executive officers, hardware and software engineers and sales and marketing personnel, could delay the development and introduction of, impact our ability to fulfill commitments to customers for, and harm our ability to sell, our products. In addition, if we are unable to fulfill our customer commitments in a timely manner we may also lose future business relationships or otherwise experience negative consequences. Despite a wave of recent layoffs in the technology sector, competitors for talent increasingly seek to hire our employees and executive officers (for example, our former Chief Financial Officer was recently hired by another semiconductor company), and the increased availability of work-from-home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition. As a result, during the last few years, we have increased our efforts to recruit and retain talent. These efforts have increased our expenses, resulted in a higher volume of equity issuances, and may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy. We believe equity compensation is a valuable component of our compensation program which helps us to attract, retain, and motivate employees and as a result we issue stock-based awards, such as RSUs, to a significant portion of our employees. A significant change in our stock price, such as the recent stock price decline in fiscal year 2023, or lower stock price performance relative to competitors, may reduce the retention value of our stock-based awards. Our employee hiring and retention also depends on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. To the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.\nChanges to U.S. immigration and export policies that restrict our ability to attract and retain technical personnel may negatively affect our research and development efforts. In addition, changes in employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs.\nIn addition, as a result of our past and any future acquisitions and related integration activities, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their futures that may impair our ability to retain, recruit or motivate key management, engineering, technical and other personnel.\nWe have adopted a hybrid work policy for our employees, where employees have the option to split their time between home and the office. However, certain types of activities such as new product innovation, critical business decision making, brainstorming sessions, providing sensitive employee feedback, and onboarding new employees may be less effective in a hybrid work environment. Our hybrid work environment may also negatively impact social interactions between employees that build camaraderie and may, therefore, negatively impact our office culture. Many companies, including companies that we compete with for talent, have announced plans to adopt full time remote work arrangements or hybrid work arrangements more flexible than ours, which may impact our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or current employees prefer these policies. In addition, as a result of our recent move to a hybrid work environment, we expect to face challenges in retention of personnel who prefer to only work from home.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or effect stock repurchases in any particular amount or at all, and statutory requirements may require us to defer payment of declared dividends or suspend stock repurchases.\nIn May 2012, we declared our first quarterly cash dividend and in October 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a $700.0 million addition to our previously existing $1.0 billion stock repurchase program. An aggregate of $1.3 billion of shares of stock have been repurchased under that program as of January 28, 2023, including 0.9 million shares of our common stock repurchased for $50.0 million pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan. Future payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and future stock repurchases are subject to, among other things: the best interests of the Company and our stockholders; our results of operations, cash balances and future cash requirements; financial condition; developments in ongoing litigation; statutory requirements under Delaware law; securities laws and regulations, market conditions; and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our dividend payments or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, a delay of, or elimination of our dividend payments or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. As of January 28, 2023, there was $449.5 million remaining available for future stock repurchases under the authorization.\nOur indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnder Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party, we have an obligation to indemnify, or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify, certain of our current and former directors and officers with respect to past, current and future investigations and litigation. Further, in the event such directors and officers are ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnification, we may not be able to recover any amounts we previously advanced to them.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that any future indemnification claims, including the cost of fees, penalties or other expenses, will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies, that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims. Additionally, to the extent there is coverage of these claims, the insurers also may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters. Furthermore, the insurers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend, pay or reimburse us for insured claims. Due to these coverage limitations, we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs we carry only limited insurance coverage, any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents, and we do not have coverage for certain losses. For example, there is very limited coverage available with respect to the services provided by our third-party manufacturing partners and assembly, testing and packaging subcontractors. In the event of a natural disaster (such as drought, earthquake or tsunami), political or military turmoil, widespread public health emergencies including pandemics, power outages, cyber-attack or incident, or other significant disruptions to their operations, insurance may not adequately protect us from this exposure. We believe our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practice, economic considerations and availability considerations. If our insurance coverage is insufficient to protect us against unforeseen losses, any uncovered losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries were classified as a passive foreign investment company, there would be adverse tax consequences.\nIf any of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries were classified as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d or \u201cPFIC\u201d under section 1297 of the Internal Revenue Code, of 1986, as amended, for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds common stock, such U.S. holder generally would be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on any gain realized on the sale or exchange of the stock and on any \u201cexcess distributions\u201d (including constructive distributions) received on the shares. Such U.S. holder could also be subject to a special interest charge with respect to any such gain or excess distribution.\nA non-U.S. entity would be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which either (i) at least 75% of its gross income is passive income or (ii) on average, the percentage of its assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50% (determined on an average gross value basis). Whether an entity will, in fact, be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year depends on its assets and income over the course of the relevant taxable year and, as a result, cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that any of our foreign based subsidiaries will not be classified as a PFIC in the future or the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge our determination concerning PFIC status for any prior period.",

Stockholder returns over the indicated periods should not be considered indicative of future stock prices or stockholder returns.\nDividends\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share payable to holders of our common stock in each quarter of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. As a result, we paid total cash dividends of $204.4 million in fiscal 2023, $191.0 million in fiscal 2022, and $160.6 million in fiscal 2021.\nFuture payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company\u2019s common stock will be subject to, among other things, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash balances and future cash requirements, financial condition, developments in ongoing litigation, statutory requirements under Delaware law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The Company\u2019s dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nSales of unregistered equity securities made during fiscal 2022 were disclosed on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended May 1, 2021; July 31, 2021; and October 30, 2021.\nIn fiscal 2023, on December 2, 2022, the Company acquired all the equity interests of a private company for cash and stock.

    "item_6": "Item 6. Reserved",
    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a leading supplier of data infrastructure semiconductor solutions, spanning the data center core to network edge. We are a fabless semiconductor supplier of high-performance standard and semi-custom products with core strengths in developing and scaling complex System-on-a-Chip architectures, integrating analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing functionality. Leveraging leading intellectual property and deep system-level expertise, as well as highly innovative security firmware, our solutions are empowering the data economy and enabling the data center, enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive/industrial end markets.\nNet revenue in fiscal 2023 was $5.9 billion and was 33% higher than net revenue of $4.5 billion in fiscal 2022. This was due to an increase in sales from a majority of our end markets. Sales increased from the data center end market by 35%, from the enterprise networking end market by 51%, from the carrier infrastructure end market by 32%, and from the automotive/industrial end market by 43% compared to fiscal 2022. The sales from our consumer end market were relatively flat for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nStarting in fiscal 2022 and through the first half of fiscal 2023, in response to a large increase in demand from our customers for our products in a majority of our end markets as they continued to invest in data infrastructure, our operations team continued to increase production with our global supply chain partners to alleviate supply constraints. However, with the start of a broad inventory correction in the semiconductor industry, supply constraints have now mostly resolved. During the second half of fiscal 2023, in response to a softening demand environment, customers started requesting to push out shipments and reschedule orders to manage their inventory. In the fourth quarter, we saw the largest impact from our storage customers. In addition, demand for our products has come down significantly from our OEM customers in China, as they deal with a changing macroeconomic situation.\nTo secure capacity over the long term, we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into capacity reservation arrangements with certain foundries and partners for substrates. See \u201cNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. As part of our response to the effects of COVID-19, we adopted a hybrid work policy where most of our employees have the option to split their time between working from home and the office. We continue to expect lingering impacts with respect to COVID-19 on our business, for a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d including but not limited to the risk detailed under the caption \u201cWe face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic which currently has, and may continue in the future to, significantly disrupt and adversely impact our manufacturing, research and development, operations, sales and financial results.\u201d\nWe expect that the U.S. government\u2019s export restrictions on certain Chinese customers to continue to impact our revenue. Moreover, concerns that U.S. companies may not be reliable suppliers as a result of these and other actions has caused, and may in the future cause, some of our customers in China to amass large inventories of our products well in advance of need or cause some of our customers to replace our products in favor of products from other suppliers. Customers in China may also choose to develop indigenous solutions, as replacements for products that are subject to U.S. export controls. In addition, there may be indirect impacts to our business that we cannot easily quantify such as the fact that some of our other customers\u2019 products which use our solutions may also be impacted by export restrictions. See also Part I, Item IA, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d including, but not limited to, the risk detailed under the caption \u201cAdverse changes in the political and economic policies of the U.S. government in connection with trade with China and Chinese customers have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business.\u201d\nOur fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will have a 53-week period. The additional week in a 53-week year is added to the fourth quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 each had a 52-week period.\nCapital Return Program. We remain committed to delivering stockholder value through our stock repurchase and dividend programs. Under the program authorized by our Board of Directors, we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open-market or through privately negotiated transactions. The extent to which we repurchase our stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions, legal rules and regulations, and other corporate considerations, as determined by our management team. We resumed our stock repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which had been temporarily suspended in fiscal 2021 to preserve cash during the COVID-19 pandemic. During our fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock for $115.0 million, including 0.9 million shares of our common stock repurchased for $50.0 million pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As of January 28, 2023, $449.5 million remained available under our stock repurchase program for future stock repurchases. See \u201cNote 11 - Stockholders\u2019 Equity\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nAs of January 28, 2023, a total of 310.4 million shares have been repurchased since inception of our current and previous stock repurchase programs for an aggregate total of $4.4 billion in cash. We returned $319.4 million to stockholders in fiscal 2023 through $115.0 million in repurchases of shares of common stock and $204.4 million in cash dividends.\nCash and Short-Term Investments. Our cash and cash equivalents were $911.0 million at January 28, 2023, which were $297.5 million higher than our balance at our fiscal year ended January 29, 2022 of $613.5 million.\nSales and Customer Composition. We regularly monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and distributors and believe these distributors\u2019 sales to diverse end customers and geographies further serve to mitigate our exposure to credit risk.\nMost of our sales are made to customers with operations located outside of the United States, primarily in Asia, and majority of our products are manufactured outside the United States. Sales shipped to customers with operations in Asia represented approximately 75% of our net revenue in fiscal 2023, 78% of our net revenue in fiscal 2022 and 80% of our net revenue in fiscal 2021. Because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors of our customers are located in Asia, we expect that most of our net revenue will continue to be represented by sales to our customers in that region. For risks related to our global operations, see Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d including but not limited to the risk detailed under the caption \u201cWe face additional risks due to the extent of our global operations since a majority of our products, and those of many of our customers, are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. The occurrence of any or a combination of the additional risks described below would significantly and negatively impact our business and results of operations.\u201d\nThe development process for our products is long, which may cause us to experience a delay between the time we incur expenses and the time revenue is generated from these expenditures. We anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. For risks related to our sales cycle, see Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d including but not limited to the risk detailed under the caption, \u201cWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory, or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet that demand, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, and business combinations. We base our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances when these carrying values are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods. In the macroeconomic environment affected by COVID-19, our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. We continue to monitor and assess our estimates in light of developments, and as events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future periods. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see \u201cNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Under the revenue recognition standard, we apply the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe enter into contracts that may include various combinations of products and services that are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. To date, the majority of the revenue has been generated by sales of products as revenue from services has been insignificant. Performance obligations associated with product sales transactions are generally satisfied when control passes to customers upon shipment. Accordingly, product revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For product revenue, the performance obligation is deemed to be the delivery of the product and therefore, the revenue is generally recognized upon shipment to customers, net of accruals for estimated sales returns and rebates. These estimates are based on historical returns, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. Actual returns could differ from these estimates. We account for rebates by recording reductions to revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based upon the terms agreed to with the customer. Some of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for price protection, price discounts and limited rights of stock rotation on products unsold by the distributors. Control passes to the distributor upon shipment, and terms and payment by our distributors is not contingent on resale of the product. Product revenue on sales made to distributors is recognized upon shipment, net of estimated variable consideration. Variable consideration primarily consists of price discounts, price protection, rebates, and stock rotation programs and is estimated based on a portfolio approach using the expected value method derived from historical data, current economic conditions, and contractual terms. Actual variable consideration could differ from these estimates.\nA portion of our net revenue is derived from sales through third-party logistics providers who maintain warehouses in close proximity to our customer\u2019s facilities. Revenue from sales through these third-party logistics providers is not recognized until the product is pulled from stock by the customer.\nOur products are generally subject to warranty, which provides for the estimated future costs of replacement upon shipment of the product. Our products carry a standard one-year warranty, with certain exceptions in which the warranty period can extend to more than one year based on contractual agreements. The warranty accrual is estimated primarily based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we will have to replace products subject to a claim. From time to time, we become aware of specific warranty situations, and we record specific accruals to cover these exposures. Warranty expenses were not material for the periods presented.\nInventories. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined under the first-in, first-out method. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reduction to the total carrying value of our inventory for any difference between cost and estimated net realizable value of inventory that is determined to be excess, obsolete or unsellable inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements. The estimate of future demand is compared to our inventory levels, including open purchase commitments, to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand and judgement to determine excess inventory may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the reduction to the total carrying value of our inventory for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if our inventory is determined to be overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Likewise, if our inventory is determined to be undervalued, we may have over-reported our cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross margin at the time the related inventory is sold. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax return and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe recognize income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on provisions of the enacted tax law and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.\nEvaluating the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires judgment and analysis of all the positive and negative evidence available, including recent earnings history and cumulative losses in recent years, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years, and as a result, in jurisdictions with cumulative losses, we have provided for a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Using available evidence and judgment, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, when it is determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been provided primarily against the U.S. and state research and development credits and certain acquired net operating losses and deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. A change in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may materially impact our tax provision in the period in which a change of assessment occurs. Taxes due on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) exclusions in U.S. are recognized as a current period expense when incurred.\nAs a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of various and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses, tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, tax incentives, the availability of tax credits and loss carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, which includes our estimates of the fair value of our intellectual property. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings and tax audits. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of audits, and the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of audits could be materially different than the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, results of operations, and cash flows. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate.\nWe are subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if these positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Changes in recognition or measurement with respect to our uncertain tax positions are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with complex tax laws. We believe we have adequately provided for in our financial statements additional taxes that we estimate to be required as a result of such examinations. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Any unpaid tax liabilities, including the interest and penalties, are released pursuant to a final settlement with tax authorities, completion of audit or expiration of various statutes of limitation. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities throughout the world include China, India, Israel, Singapore, Germany, and the United States.\nThe recognition and measurement of current taxes payable or refundable, and deferred tax assets and liabilities require that we make certain estimates and judgments. Changes to these estimates or judgments may have a material effect on our income tax provision in a future period.\nLong-lived Assets and Intangible Assets. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022significant decreases in the market price of the asset;\n\u2022significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors;\n\u2022accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset;\n\u2022current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and\n\u2022current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.\nWhenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of long-lived assets and intangible assets may not be recoverable, we estimate the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset from its use or eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. These significant judgments may include future expected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, discount rates and whether or not alternative uses are available for impacted long-lived assets.\nGoodwill. We record goodwill when the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We review goodwill for impairment annually on the last business day of our fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. We have identified that our business operates as a single operating segment and as a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or we may determine to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.\nFactors we consider important in the qualitative assessment which could trigger a goodwill impairment review include;\n\u2022significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n\u2022significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n\u2022significant negative industry or economic trends;\n\u2022a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and\n\u2022a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value.\nIf we assess qualitative factors and conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we determine not to use qualitative assessment, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value. We would record an impairment loss in the fiscal quarter in which an impairment determination is made. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nAs of the last day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we performed our annual impairment assessment for testing goodwill. A step one assessment was performed. Based on our assessment, we determined there was no goodwill impairment.\nBusiness Combinations. We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of a business acquisition to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Our valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. The valuation of intangible assets, in particular, requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates: future expected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, and discount rates. We estimate the fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022\nThe following table sets forth information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue:\nNet Revenue\nOur net revenue for fiscal 2023 increased by $1.5 billion compared to net revenue for fiscal 2022. This was due to an increase in sales from a majority of our end markets. Sales increased from the data center end market by 35%, from the enterprise networking end market by 51%, from the carrier infrastructure end market by 32%, and from the automotive/industrial end market by 43% compared to fiscal 2022. The sales from the consumer end market were relatively flat for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nThe overall increase in revenue of 33% for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by relatively higher sales of products with higher average selling prices associated with higher content and more features. In addition, the overall increase in net revenue was also driven by an increase in demand for our products and the year-over-year impact of acquisitions made in fiscal 2022, with both factors contributing to higher sales of products and higher unit shipments.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue decreased for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower amortization of inventory fair value adjustment and acquired intangible assets as a percentage of net revenue. As a result, gross profit for fiscal 2023 increased 4.2 percentage points compared to fiscal 2022.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense increased by $360.1 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to $255.1 million of higher employee personnel-related costs, including $99.2 million of higher stock-based compensation expense, as a result of headcount increases, including the addition of new employees from our recent acquisitions, $42.0 million of higher engineering design costs, and $24.9 million higher depreciation and amortization costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased by $111.7 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a $97.9 million decrease in transaction and integration costs associated with our acquisitions of Inphi and Innovium, Inc. (\u201cInnovium\u201d) that were incurred in the prior year. In addition, our employee personnel-related costs were lower by $13.7 million due to lower stock based compensation expense mainly related to accelerated vesting of Inphi equity awards incurred in the prior year as part of the Inphi acquisition.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense increased by $74.9 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Stock-based compensation under research and development and cost of goods sold increased by $99.2 million and $12.2 million, respectively, partially offset by decrease under selling, general and administrative expense by $36.5 million. The increase was mainly due to additional equity awards assumed as part of the Inphi and Innovium acquisitions as described in \u201cNote 7 - Business Combinations\u201d and \u201cNote 12 - Employee Benefit Plans\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense under selling, general and administrative expense was mainly related to accelerated vesting of Inphi/Innovium equity awards incurred in the prior year as part of the Inphi and Innovium acquisitions.\nLegal Settlement\n*Not meaningful\nWe recorded a charge of $100.0 million in fiscal year 2023 related to the settlement of a contractual dispute. Refer to \u201cNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of this settlement.\nRestructuring Related Charges\nFiscal 2023 vs Fiscal 2022: We recorded total restructuring related charges of $21.6 million in fiscal 2023 as we integrated the acquired businesses and continued to evaluate our existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and improve profitability.\nFiscal 2022 vs Fiscal 2021: During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we made changes to the scope of our server processor product line in response to changes in the associated market. We transitioned our product offering from standard server processors to the broad server market to focus only on customized server processors for a few targeted customers. This change in strategy required us to assess whether the carrying value of the associated assets would be recoverable. As a result of the assessment, we determined the carrying amount of certain impacted assets were not recoverable, which resulted in recognition of $119.0 million of restructuring related charges associated with the server processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The charges included $50.3 million in impairment of acquired intangibles, $36.0 million in impairment of purchased IP licenses and $32.7 million in equipment and inventory impairment and other related restructuring charges. The remaining restructuring charges of $61.4 million include approximately $36.9 million in severance and related costs and $24.5 million in other costs. The severance costs primarily relate to the employee separation costs in connection with the acquisitions. The other costs primarily relate to the remaining payments under lease obligations upon vacating certain worldwide office locations, and ongoing operating expenses of vacated facilities. See \u201cNote 10 - Restructuring\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased by $4.5 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to higher interest rates on our invested cash and higher cash balance.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $31.3 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the 2024 and 2026 Term Loans and the Senior Notes, partially offset by prior period costs associated with the bridge loan termination.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net increased by $9.7 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to gains from equity investments and exchange rate fluctuations.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe income tax expense for fiscal 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the remeasurement of Singapore deferred taxes upon extension of the Company\u2019s tax incentive in Singapore, tax benefits attributable to reduction in tax reserves as a result of settled income tax audits in combination with the lapsing of statute of limitations, offset by foreign income inclusions in the U.S., and a tax expense related to the recapture of Israel corporate income taxes. The income tax expense for fiscal 2023 is also impacted by a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s earnings, or in some cases, losses being taxed or benefited at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, stock compensation tax benefits, and disallowed deductions related to non-deductible compensation.\nThe income tax benefit for fiscal 2022 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits of stock-based compensation, offset by foreign income inclusions in the U.S. and non-deductible compensation. We continue to evaluate potential changes to our legal entity structure in response to guidelines and requirements in various international tax jurisdictions where we conduct business, as well as changes to our business, and acquisitions and divestitures.\nOur provision for incomes taxes may be affected by changes in the geographic mix of earnings with different applicable tax rates, acquisitions, changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of income tax audits, the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations. It is also possible that significant negative evidence may become available that causes us to conclude that a valuation allowance is needed on certain of our deferred tax assets, which would adversely affect our income tax provision in the period of such change in judgment. Additionally, please see the information in \u201cItem 1A: Risk Factors\u201d under the caption \u201cChanges in existing taxation benefits, tax rules or tax practices may adversely affect our financial results.\u201d\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended January 30, 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between the fiscal years ended January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 in Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity as of January 28, 2023 consisted of approximately $911.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $642.0 million was held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States. See \u201cNote 13 - Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIn December 2020, to fund the Inphi acquisition, we executed the 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement to obtain the 2024 and 2026 Term Loans. For the year ended January 28, 2023, we repaid $65.6 million of the principal outstanding on the 2026 Term Loan. As of January 28, 2023, we had $735.0 million borrowings outstanding under the 2024 Term Loan and $787.5 million borrowings outstanding under the 2026 Term Loan.\nIn December 2020, we also executed a debt agreement to obtain a $750.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201c2020 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). During the year ended January 28, 2023 we drew down $200.0 million on the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility which has been fully repaid at January 28, 2023.\nAs of January 28, 2023, we had $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding and $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of the MTG/MTI Senior Notes outstanding. The notes are registered under the Securities Act.\nFor a description of our contractual obligations including debt, leases, and purchase commitments, see \u201cNote 4 - Debt,\u201d \u201cNote 5 - Leases,\u201d and \u201cNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see \u201cNote 13 - Income Taxes\u201d regarding tax related contingencies and uncertain tax positions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, and funds from our 2020 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, any declared dividends, repurchases of our common stock and commitments (including those discussed in \u201cNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) for at least the next twelve months. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, market acceptance of our products, costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the timing and extent of research and development projects and increases in operating expenses, all of which are subject to uncertainty.\nTo the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated by operations, and funds available under our 2020 Revolving Credit Facility are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing. We may also acquire additional businesses, purchase assets or enter into other strategic arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek debt or equity financing. Additional equity financing or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders. If we elect to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock.\nFuture payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and our planned repurchases of common stock will be subject to, among other things, the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, our results of operations, cash balances and future cash requirements, financial condition, developments in ongoing litigation, statutory requirements under Delaware law, U.S. securities laws and regulations, market conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our dividend payments and repurchases of common stock may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase stock at all or in any particular amounts.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion for fiscal 2023 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $819.3 million for fiscal 2022. We had a net loss of $163.5 million adjusted for the following non-cash items: amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 billion, stock-based compensation expense of $552.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $304.9 million, deferred income tax expense of $50.4 million, amortization of inventory fair value adjustment associated with Innovium acquisition of $38.7 million, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and debt discounts of $10.3 million, restructuring related impairment charges of $5.6 million and $52.4 million net loss from other non-cash items. Cash outflow from working capital of $649.8 million for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in inventories, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a decrease in accounts payable partially offset by cash inflows due to an increase in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities and an increase in accrued employee compensation. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increase sales, as well as changes to the timing of shipments due to evolving supply chain dynamics. We increased inventory in order to better support unfulfilled backlog, new product ramps and the impact from inventory correction late in the year. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to prepayments on supply capacity reservation agreements and an increase in ship and debit reserve. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. The increase in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities was primarily due to accruals relating to settlement of contractual disputes and an increase in ship and debit claim reserve due to price increases and stock replenishment. The increase in accrued employee compensation was due to increases in our bonus accrual and in employee contributions to the employee stock purchase plan, net of payments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $819.3 million for fiscal 2022. We had a net loss of $421.0 million adjusted for the following non-cash items: amortization of acquired intangible assets of $979.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $460.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $265.9 million, amortization of inventory fair value adjustment associated with Inphi and Innovium acquisitions of $194.3 million, deferred income tax benefit of $93.9 million, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and debt discounts of $21.6 million, restructuring related impairment charges of $6.2 million and $69.0 million net loss from other non-cash items. Cash outflow from working capital of $662.9 million was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in inventories and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. Such increases were partially offset by cash inflows due to an increase in accounts payable, an increase in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities and an increase in accrued employee compensation. The increase in accounts receivable was driven primarily by the increase in revenue and stable collections. The increase in inventories is due to strong organic revenue growth and business acquisitions during the year as well as higher materials and manufacturing prices. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was due to payments for capacity reservation agreements and an increase in ship and debit reserve. The increase in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities was mainly due to an increase in ship and debit claim reserve due to price increase and stock replenishment. The increase in accounts payable was mainly due to timing of payments. The increase in accrued employee compensation was due to the increase in our bonus accrual.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $328.4 million in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the purchases of property and equipment of $206.2 million, net cash consideration for business acquisitions of $112.3 million, and purchases of technology licenses of $11.1 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $3.7 billion in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by the net cash consideration for business acquisitions of $3.6 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $169.2 million and purchases of technology licenses of $17.7 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $662.9 million in fiscal 2023 was primarily attributable to $265.6 million repayment of debt principal, $227.6 million for withholding tax paid on behalf of employees for net share settlement, $204.4 million payment for our quarterly dividends, $142.5 million payments for technology license obligations and $115.0 million repurchases of common stock. These outflows were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of debt of $200.0 million, and $91.3 million proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our equity inventive plans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2022 was primarily attributable to proceeds from issuance of debt of $3.9 billion, $160.3 million proceeds from capped calls and $84.5 million proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our equity inventive plans. These inflows were partially offset by $526.8 million repayment of debt principal, $305.8 million for withholding tax paid on behalf of employees for net share settlement, $191.0 million payment for our quarterly dividends, $181.2 million payment for repurchases and settlement of convertible notes, $134.5 million payments for technology license obligations and $11.8 million payments for debt financing and equity issuance costs associated with the Inphi acquisition.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease see \u201cNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRelated Party Transactions\nNone.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk. With our outstanding debt, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding 2024 and 2026 Term Loans. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. A hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate by 1 percentage point may result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense by approximately $15.1 million.\nWe currently carry debt that relies on one-month LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The one-month LIBOR is expected to cease publication after June 30, 2023. To the extent the one-month LIBOR ceases to exist, the 2024 and 2026 Term Loans and 2020 Revolving Credit Facility contemplate an alternative benchmark rate without the need for any amendment thereto.\nWe maintain an investment policy that requires minimum credit ratings, diversification of credit risk and limits the long-term interest rate risk by requiring effective maturities of generally less than five years. We typically invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, money market mutual funds, corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale and time deposits. These investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with their related unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of stockholders\u2019 equity. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. There were no such investments on hand at January 28, 2023, aside from cash and cash equivalents.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. All of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. Since we operate in many countries, a percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and exchange volatility could positively or negatively impact those operating costs. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we may hold certain assets and liabilities, including potential tax liabilities, in local currency on our consolidated balance sheet. These tax liabilities would be settled in local currency. Therefore, foreign exchange gains and losses from remeasuring the tax liabilities are recorded to interest and other income, net. We do not believe that foreign exchange volatility has a material impact on our current business or results of operations. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business or results of operations in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies.\nWe may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within operating expense, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, our operating expense could increase by approximately 2%.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 9, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInventories - Management Judgements Regarding Excess and Obsolete Inventory Reserves - Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nManagement writes down excess inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to forecasted demand. Management\u2019s estimates of forecasted demand are based upon analysis and assumptions including, but not limited to, expected product lifecycles and development plans, expected customer orders, projected market conditions, and historical usage by product. As of January 28, 2023, the Company\u2019s consolidated inventories balance was $1,068 million.\nWe identified inventory valuation as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions management makes with regards to estimating the excess write-down and the potential amplification of those judgments in periods of market uncertainty. Specifically, due to the ongoing market uncertainty, including the business impact of the macroeconomic environment, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates of forecasted demand required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management\u2019s estimates of forecasted demand used in the valuation of inventory included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over management\u2019s provisions for excess inventories, including internal controls designed to review and approve forecasted demand and the underlying assumptions regarding expected product lifecycles, product development plans, expected customer orders, projected market conditions, and historical usage by product.\n\u2022We evaluated management\u2019s ability to accurately estimate forecasted demand by comparing estimates made in prior periods to the historical actual results for those same periods.\n\u2022We made inquiries of business unit managers throughout the period as well as executives, sales, and operations personnel about the expected product lifecycles and product development plans and historical usage by product and compared expectations to actual developments over the period.\n\u2022We selected a sample of inventory products and tested the forecasted demand by comparing internal and external information (e.g., historical usage, contracts, communications with customers, macroeconomic conditions, etc.) with the Company\u2019s forecast.\n\u2022We considered, when relevant, the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal financial and operational information used by management and the board of directors, Company press releases, and analysts' reports, as well as our observations and inquires as to changes within the business and evidence obtained through other areas of the audit.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Jose, California\nMarch 9, 2023\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2016.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except par value per share)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation\nThe Company\nMarvell Technology, Inc., and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d), is a leading supplier of data infrastructure semiconductor solutions, spanning the data center core to network edge. The Company is a fabless semiconductor supplier of high-performance standard and semi-custom products with core strengths in developing and scaling complex System-on-a-Chip architectures, integrating analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing functionality. The Company also leverages leading intellectual property and deep system-level expertise, as well as highly innovative security firmware. The Company\u2019s solutions are empowering the data economy and enabling the data center, enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive/industrial end markets. The Company is incorporated in Delaware, United States.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will have a 53-week period. The additional week in a 53-week year is added to the fourth quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 each had a 52-week period. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to performance-based compensation, revenue recognition, provisions for sales returns and allowances, inventory excess and obsolescence, investment fair values, goodwill and other intangible assets, restructuring, income taxes, litigation and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods. In the macroeconomic environment affected by COVID-19, these estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, these estimates may change materially in future periods.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and time deposits.\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nThe Company has equity investments in privately-held companies. If the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, but not control, the Company accounts for the investment under the equity method. If the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee, the Company accounts for the investment under the measurement alternative method. Investments in privately-held companies are included in other non-current assets and subject to impairment review on an ongoing basis. Investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investment\u2019s cost basis. This assessment is based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis, including, but not limited to, the investee\u2019s revenue and earnings trends, available cash and liquidity, and the status of the investee\u2019s products and the related market for such products.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with high-quality financial institutions, the composition and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management. The Company believes that the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by the Company\u2019s credit evaluation process, relatively short collection terms and the high level of credit worthiness of its customers. For customers including distributors, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of their financial conditions and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary based upon payment history and their current credit worthiness, but generally requires no collateral. The Company regularly reviews the allowance for bad debt and doubtful accounts by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, reasonable and supportable forecasts, age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer\u2019s ability to pay.\nThe Company\u2019s accounts receivable was concentrated with five customers at January 28, 2023, who comprise a total of 55% of gross accounts receivable, compared with six customers at January 29, 2022, who represented 52% of gross accounts receivable, respectively. This presentation is at the customer consolidated level.\nDuring fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, there was no net revenue attributable to a customer, other than one distributor, whose revenues as a percentage of net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenues. Net revenue attributable to significant distributors whose revenues as a percentage of net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenues is presented in the following table:\nThe Company continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its distributors and believes these distributors\u2019 sales to diverse end customers and to diverse geographies further serve to mitigate the Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk.\nInventories\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined under the first-in, first-out method. The total carrying value of the Company\u2019s inventory is reduced for any difference between cost and estimated net realizable value of inventory that is determined to be excess, obsolete or unsellable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand for the Company\u2019s products is less than currently forecasted, the Company may be required to write inventory down below the current carrying value. Once the carrying value of inventory is reduced, it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed. Inventoriable shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which ranges from 2 to 7 years for machinery and equipment, and 3 to 4 years for computer software, and furniture and fixtures. Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 30 years and building improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives of 15 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is measured and tested for impairment annually on the last business day of the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or the Company may determine to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nIf the Company assesses qualitative factors and concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if the Company determines not to use the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company has identified that its business operates as a single operating segment and as a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, the Company would record an impairment loss in the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.\nLong-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets\nThe Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The Company estimates the future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, expected to be generated by the assets from its use or eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Please see \u201cNote 8 - Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, Net\u201d for further details regarding impairment of acquisition-related identified intangible assets.\nAcquisition-related identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives, except for certain customer contracts and related relationships, which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization over the expected customer lives. In-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) is not amortized until the completion of the related development.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets also include any initial direct costs and prepayments less lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. As the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nThe functional currency of all of the Company\u2019s non-United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) operations is the U.S. dollar. Monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are re-measured using the foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Operational accounts and nonmonetary balance sheet accounts are measured and recorded at the exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction. The effects of foreign currency re-measurement are reported in current operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nProduct revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from product sales. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For product revenue, the performance obligation is deemed to be the delivery of the product and therefore, the revenue is generally recognized upon shipment to customers, net of accruals for estimated sales returns and rebates. These estimates are based on historical returns analysis and other known factors. The Company accounts for rebates by recording reductions to revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based upon the terms agreed to with the customer. Product revenue on sales made to distributors is recognized upon shipment, net of estimated variable consideration. Variable consideration primarily consists of price discounts, price protection, rebates, and stock rotation programs and is estimated based on a portfolio approach using the expected value method derived from historical data, current economic conditions, and contractual terms.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s net revenue is derived from sales through third-party logistics providers who maintain warehouses in close proximity to our customer\u2019s facilities. Revenue from sales through these third-party logistics providers is not recognized until the product is pulled from stock by the customer.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Company\u2019s products are generally subject to warranty, which provides for the estimated future costs of replacement upon shipment of the product. The Company\u2019s products carry a standard one-year warranty, with certain exceptions in which the warranty period can extend to more than one year based on contractual agreements. The warranty accrual is estimated primarily based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that the Company will have to replace products subject to a claim. From time to time, the Company becomes aware of specific warranty situations, and it records specific accruals to cover these exposures. Warranty expenses were not material for the periods presented.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration of its acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recorded $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million of advertising costs for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service vesting period. The Company amortizes stock-based compensation expense for time-based awards under the straight-line attribution method over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards is recognized when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. The Company amortizes stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards using the accelerated method.\nThe fair value of each restricted stock unit is estimated based on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant less the expected dividend yield.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock purchase awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of performance-based awards based on total shareholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d) and value creation (\u201cVCA\u201d) awards are estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nForfeitures are recorded when they occur. Previously recognized expense is reversed for the portion of awards forfeited prior to vesting as and when forfeitures occur.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss, net of tax is comprised of net loss. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no reconciling differences between net loss and comprehensive loss.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe Company estimates its income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves estimating the Company\u2019s actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax return and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company recognizes income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on provisions of the enacted tax law and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nEvaluating the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets requires judgment and analysis of all available positive and negative evidence, including recent earnings history and cumulative losses in recent years, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, when it is determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been provided primarily against U.S. and state research and development credits and certain acquired net operating losses and deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. A change in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may materially impact the Company\u2019s tax provision in the period in which a change occurs. Taxes due on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions in U.S. are recognized as a current period expense when incurred.\nAs a multinational corporation, the Company conducts its business in many countries and is subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of the business is subject to the application of various and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of the Company\u2019s worldwide earnings or losses, the tax laws and regulations in various localities, the availability of tax incentives, tax credits and loss carryforwards, and the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s tax planning strategies, including the Company\u2019s estimates of the fair value of its intellectual property. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially affect the Company\u2019s tax liability and/or effective income tax rate.\nThe Company is subject to income tax audits by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if these positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Changes in judgment regarding the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions are reflected in the period in which the change occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The calculation of the Company\u2019s tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with complex tax laws. The Company believes it has adequately provided for in its financial statements additional taxes that it estimates may be required to be paid as a result of such examinations. While the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than its accrued position. Unpaid tax liabilities, including the interest and penalties, are released pursuant to a final settlement with tax authorities, completion of audit or expiration of various statutes of limitations. The material jurisdictions in which the Company may be subject to potential examination by tax authorities throughout the world include China, India, Israel, Singapore, Germany, and the United States.\nThe recognition and measurement of current taxes payable or refundable, and deferred tax assets and liabilities require that the Company make certain estimates and judgments. Changes to these estimates or judgments may have a material effect on the Company\u2019s tax provision in a future period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance should be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date. The new standard was early adopted by the Company on January 30, 2022 and did not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3 - Revenue\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from sales of the Company\u2019s products.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes net revenue disaggregated by end market (in millions, except percentages):\nThe following table summarizes net revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market based on destination of shipment (in millions, except percentages):\nThese destinations of shipment are not necessarily indicative of the geographic location of the Company\u2019s end customers or the country in which the Company\u2019s end customers sell devices containing the Company\u2019s products. For example, a substantial majority of the shipments made to China relate to sales to non-China based customers that have factories or contract manufacturing operations located within China.\nThe following table summarizes net revenue disaggregated by customer type (in millions, except percentages):\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities consist of the Company\u2019s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration or the amount is due from the customer. Contract liability balances are comprised of deferred revenue. The amount of revenue recognized during the year ended January 28, 2023, that was included in deferred revenue balance at January 29, 2022 was not material.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAs of the end of a reporting period, some of the performance obligations associated with contracts will have been unsatisfied or only partially satisfied. In accordance with the practical expedients available in the guidance, the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.\nSales Commissions\nThe Company has elected to apply the practical expedient to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period is typically one year or less. These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNote 4 - Debt\nSummary of Borrowings and Outstanding Debt\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s outstanding debt at January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 (in millions):\n(1)As of January 28, 2023, the current portion of outstanding debt that is due within twelve months includes the MTG/MTI 2023 Senior Notes and the portion of the 2026 Term Loan - 5 Year Tranche. The Company intends to repay the amount with operating cash flow. The weighted average interest rate on short-term debt outstanding at January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 was 4.448% and 1.485%, respectively.\nIn December 2020, the Company executed a debt agreement to obtain a 3-year $875.0 million term loan and a 5-year $875.0 million term loan. The Company also executed a debt agreement to obtain a 5-year $750.0 million revolving credit facility in December 2020, replacing its previous $500 million revolving credit facility. On April 12, 2021, the Company completed a debt offering and issued (i) $500.0 million of Senior Notes with a 5-year term due in 2026, (ii) $750.0 million of Senior Notes with a 7-year term due in 2028, and (iii) $750.0 million of Senior Notes with a 10-year term due in 2031.\nOn May 4, 2021, in conjunction with the U.S. domiciliation, the Company exchanged certain existing senior notes due in 2023 and 2028 that were previously issued by the Bermuda-domiciled Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (the \u201cMTG Senior Notes\u201d) with like notes that are now issued by the Delaware-domiciled Marvell Technology, Inc. (the \u201cMTI Senior Notes\u201d). Below is further discussion of the terms of the various debt agreements.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n2024 and 2026 Term Loans\nOn December 7, 2020, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement with a lending syndicate led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A (the \u201c2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement\u201d) in order to finance the merger with Inphi. The 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement provides for borrowings of $1.75 billion consisting of: (i) $875 million loan with a three-year term from the funding date (the \u201c3-Year Tranche Loan\u201d) and (ii) $875 million loan with a five-year term from the funding date (the \u201c5-Year Tranche Loan\u201d and, together with the 3-Year Tranche Loan, the \"2024 and 2026 Term Loans\").\nThe 3-Year Tranche Loan has a stated floating interest rate which equates to reserve-adjusted LIBOR + 125 bps. The effective interest rate for the 3-Year Tranche Loan was 4.027% as of January 28, 2023. The 5-Year Tranche Loan has a stated floating interest rate which equates to reserve-adjusted LIBOR + 137.5 bps. The effective interest rate for the 5-Year Tranche Loan was 4.665% as of January 28, 2023. The 3-Year Tranche Loan does not require any scheduled principal payments prior to final maturity but does permit the Company to make early principal payments without premium or penalty. The 5-year Tranche Loan requires scheduled principal payments at the end of each fiscal quarter equal to (i) 1.25% of the aggregate principal amount on the term funding date for the first four full fiscal quarters following the term loan funding date, (ii) 2.50% of the aggregate principal amount on the term funding date for the fifth through twelfth full fiscal quarters following the term loan funding date, and (iii) 3.75% of the aggregate principal amount on the term funding date for each fiscal quarter following the twelfth full fiscal quarter following the term loan funding date. During the year ended January 28, 2023, the Company repaid $65.6 million of the principal outstanding of the 5-Year Tranche Loan.\nThe 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement requires that the Company and its subsidiaries comply with covenants relating to customary matters, including with respect to creating or permitting certain liens, entering into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidating, merging, liquidating or dissolving. It also prohibits subsidiaries of the Company from incurring additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, and requires that the Company maintain a leverage ratio financial covenant as of the end of any fiscal quarter. As of January 28, 2023, the Company had $1.5 billion 2024 and 2026 Term Loan borrowings outstanding, and was in compliance with its debt covenants.\n2020 Revolving Credit Facility\nOn December 7, 2020, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement (\u201c2020 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with a lending syndicate led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A for borrowings of up to $750 million. Borrowings from the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility are intended for general corporate use, which may include among other things, the financing of acquisitions, the refinancing of other indebtedness and the payment of transaction expenses related to the foregoing. The 2020 Revolving Credit Facility has a five-year term and a stated floating interest rate which equates to reserve-adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The Company may prepay any borrowings at any time without premium or penalty. An unused commitment fee is payable quarterly based on unused balances at a rate that is based on the ratings of the Company\u2019s senior unsecured long-term indebtedness. This annual rate was 0.175% at January 28, 2023.\nDuring the quarter ended July 30, 2022, the Company drew down $200.0 million on the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility, of which $130.0 million was repaid in the same quarter. During the quarter ended October 29, 2022, the Company repaid the remaining outstanding amount of $70.0 million. As of January 28, 2023, the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and will be available for draw down through December 7, 2025.\nThe 2020 Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company and its subsidiaries comply with covenants relating to customary matters. The covenants are consistent with the 2024 and 2026 Term Loans covenants discussed above.\nThe Company currently carries debt that relies on one-month LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The one-month LIBOR is expected to cease publication after June 30, 2023. To the extent the one-month LIBOR ceases to exist, the 2024 and 2026 Term Loans and 2020 Revolving Credit Facility agreements contemplate an alternative benchmark rate without the need for any amendment thereto.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n2026, 2028, and 2031 Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn April 12, 2021, the Company completed an offering of (i) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s 1.650% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Senior Notes\u201d), (ii) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s 2.450% Senior Notes due 2028 (the \u201c2028 Senior Notes\u201d) and (iii) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s 2.950% Senior Notes due 2031 (the \u201c2031 Senior Notes,\u201d and, together with the 2026 Senior Notes and the 2028 Senior Notes, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). On October 8, 2021, the Senior Notes issued on April 12, 2021 were exchanged for new notes. The terms of the new notes issued in the exchange are substantially identical to the notes issued in April 2021, except that the new notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the transfer restrictions and registration rights applicable to the Senior Notes issued in April 2021 do not apply to the new notes.\nThe 2026 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2026, the 2028 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2028, and the 2031 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2031. The stated and effective interest rates for the 2026 Senior Notes are 1.650% and 1.839%, respectively. The stated and effective interest rates for the 2028 Senior Notes are 2.450% and 2.554%, respectively. The stated and effective interest rates for the 2031 Senior Notes are 2.950% and 3.043%, respectively. The Company may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their respective maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event (which involves the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings event involving the Senior Notes being rated below investment grade), the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The indenture governing the Senior Notes also contains certain limited covenants restricting the Company\u2019s ability to incur certain liens, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with any other entity or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s properties or assets to another person, which, in each case, are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. As of January 28, 2023, the Company had $2.0 billion Senior Notes borrowings outstanding.\n2023 and 2028 Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn June 22, 2018, the Company\u2019s Bermuda-based parent company Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (\u201cMTG\u201d) completed a public offering of (i) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.200% Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201cMTG 2023 Notes\u201d) and (ii) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (the \u201cMTG 2028 Notes\u201d and, together with the 2023 Notes, the \u201cMTG Senior Notes\u201d).\nIn April 2021, in conjunction with the Company\u2019s U.S. domiciliation, the Company commenced Exchange Offers on April 19, 2021 for the outstanding $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of MTG Senior Notes outstanding in exchange for corresponding senior notes to be issued by the Company\u2019s U.S. domiciled parent MTI. MTI made an offer to (i) exchange any and all of the outstanding MTG 2023 Notes for up to an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million of new 4.200% Senior Notes due 2023 issued by MTI (the \u201cMTI 2023 Notes\u201d) and to (ii) exchange any and all of the outstanding MTG 2028 Notes for up to an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million of new 4.875% Senior Notes due 2028 issued by MTI (the \u201cMTI 2028 Notes\u201d and, together with the MTI 2023 Notes, the \u201cMTI Senior Notes\u201d). Each new series of MTI Senior Notes have the same interest rate, maturity date, redemption terms and interest payment dates and are subject to substantially similar covenants as the corresponding series of the MTG Senior Notes for which they were offered in exchange.\nThe settlement of the Exchange Offers occurred on May 4, 2021 with $433.9 million aggregate principal amount of the MTG 2023 Notes and $479.5 million aggregate principal amount of the MTG 2028 Notes. The exchange was accounted for as a debt modification in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. On December 16, 2021, the MTI Senior Notes issued on May 4, 2021 were exchanged for new notes. The terms of the new notes issued in the exchange are substantially identical to the notes issued in May 2021, except that the new notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the transfer restrictions and registration rights applicable to the MTI Senior Notes issued in May 2021 do not apply to the new notes.\nThe MTI 2023 Notes mature on June 22, 2023 and the MTI 2028 Notes mature on June 22, 2028. The stated and effective interest rates for the MTI 2023 Notes are 4.200% and 4.502%, respectively. The stated and effective interest rates for the MTI 2028 Notes are 4.875% and 4.988%, respectively. The Company may redeem the MTI Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at the redemption prices set forth in MTI Senior Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event (which involves the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings event involving the MTI Senior Notes being rated below investment grade), the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the MTI Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The indenture governing the MTI Senior Notes also contains certain limited covenants restricting the Company\u2019s ability to incur certain liens, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with any other entity or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s properties or assets to another person, which, in each case, are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe MTG 2023 Notes mature on June 22, 2023 and the MTG 2028 Notes mature on June 22, 2028. The stated and effective interest rates for the MTG 2023 Notes are 4.200% and 4.360%, respectively. The stated and effective interest rates for the MTG 2028 Notes are 4.875% and 4.940%, respectively. The Company may redeem the MTG Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at the redemption prices set forth in MTG Senior Notes.\nAs of January 28, 2023, the Company had $1.0 billion MTG/MTI Senior Notes borrowings outstanding.\nInterest Expense and Future Contractual Maturities\nDuring fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Company recognized $159.6 million and $119.0 million of interest expense, respectively, in its consolidated statements of operations related to interest, amortization of debt issuance costs and accretion of discount associated with the outstanding term loans and senior notes.\nAs of January 28, 2023, the aggregate future contractual maturities of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt, at face value, were as follows (in millions):\nNote 5 - Leases\nThe Company\u2019s leases primarily include facility leases and hosting/data center leases, which are all classified as operating leases. For hosting/data center leases, the Company elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease component as a single lease component.\nLease expense and supplemental cash flow information are as follows (in millions):\nThe effect of operating lease right-of-use asset amortization of $32.5 million, $28.9 million and $21.6 million is included in changes in Other expense, net in the cash provided by operating activities section on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe aggregate future lease payments for operating leases as of January 28, 2023 are as follows (in millions):\nAverage lease terms and discount rates were as follows:\nNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies\nWarranty Obligations\nThe Company\u2019s products carry a standard one-year warranty with certain exceptions in which the warranty period can extend to more than one year based on contractual agreements. The Company\u2019s warranty expense has not been material in the periods presented.\nCommitments\nThe Company\u2019s commitments primarily consist of wafer purchase obligations with foundry partners, supply capacity reservation payment commitments with foundries and test & assembly partners, and technology license fee obligations.\nTotal future unconditional purchase commitments as of January 28, 2023, are as follows (in millions):\nTechnology license fees include the liabilities under agreements for technology licenses between the Company and various vendors.\nUnder the Company\u2019s manufacturing relationships with its foundry partners, cancellation of outstanding purchase orders is allowed but requires payment of all costs and expenses incurred through the date of cancellation, and in some cases, may result in incremental fees, loss of amounts paid in advance, or loss of priority to reserved capacity for a period of time.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Company entered into manufacturing supply capacity reservation agreements with foundries and test & assembly suppliers during the current and prior fiscal year. Under these arrangements, the Company agreed to pay capacity fees or refundable deposits to the suppliers in exchange for reserved manufacturing production capacity over the term of the agreements, which ranges from 4 to 10 years. In addition, the Company committed to certain purchase levels that were in line with the capacity reserved. The Company currently estimates that it has agreed to purchase level commitments of at least $2.8 billion of wafers, substrates, and other manufacturing products for the fiscal years 2024 through 2033 under the capacity reservation agreements. In addition, total fees and refundable deposits payable under these arrangements are $99.0 million in fiscal years 2024 through 2026. Such purchase commitments are summarized in the preceding table.\nIn September 2021, the Company entered into an IP licensing agreement with a vendor which provides complete access to the vendor\u2019s IP portfolio for 10 years. The arrangement provides access to IP over the term of the contract, including existing IP, as well as IP in development, and to be developed in the future. The contract provides support and maintenance over the term of the contract as well. Aggregate fees of $354 million are payable quarterly over the contract term.\nContingencies and Legal Proceedings\nThe Company currently is, and may from time to time become, subject to claims, lawsuits, governmental inquiries, inspections or investigations and other legal proceedings (collectively, \u201cLegal Matters\u201d) arising in the course of its business. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer in relation to a contractual dispute pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay the customer $100.0 million in cash over several quarters.\nThe Company is currently unable to predict the final outcome of its other pending Legal Matters and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss or estimate a range of possible loss, except with respect to amounts where it has determined a loss is both probable and estimable and has made an accrual. The Company evaluates, at least on a quarterly basis, developments in its Legal Matters that could affect the amount of any accrual, as well as any developments that would result in a loss contingency to become both probable and reasonably estimable. The ultimate outcome of any Legal Matter involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. An unfavorable outcome in a Legal Matter could require the Company to pay damages or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain jurisdictions. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the results of the Legal Matters in which it is currently involved, the Company does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these Legal Matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, however, there can be no assurance that the current or any future Legal Matters will be resolved in a manner that is not adverse to the Company\u2019s business, financial statements, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company became involved in discussions with another party to resolve disputes that ultimately concluded with settlement by the Company in the amount of $36.0 million which was accrued at the time such offer of settlement was determined by management. Such amount is presented separately on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021.\nIndemnities, Commitments and Guarantees\nDuring its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities may include indemnities for general commercial obligations, indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease, and indemnities to directors and officers of the Company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of Delaware. In addition, the Company has contractual commitments to various customers, which could require the Company to incur costs to repair an epidemic defect with respect to its products outside of the normal warranty period if such defect were to occur. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. Some of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments that the Company could be obligated to make. In general, the Company does not record any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated and are not considered probable. The Company does, however, accrue for losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from indemnification provisions, when future payment is probable and estimable.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nIntellectual Property Indemnification\nIn addition to the above indemnities, the Company has agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims made against the Company\u2019s products where such claims allege infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, patents, registered trademarks, and/or copyrights. Under the aforementioned indemnification clauses, the Company may be obligated to defend the customer and pay for the damages awarded against the customer as well as the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under an infringement claim. The Company\u2019s indemnification obligations generally do not expire after termination or expiration of the agreement containing the indemnification obligation. Generally, but not always, there are limits on and exceptions to the Company\u2019s potential liability for indemnification. Historically the Company has not made significant payments under these indemnification obligations and the Company cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments, if any, that it might be required to make as a result of these agreements. The maximum potential amount of any future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant.\nNote 7 - Business Combinations\nInnovium\nOn October 5, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Innovium, Inc. (\u201cInnovium\u201d), a leading provider of networking solutions for cloud and edge data centers, in an all-stock transaction for total purchase consideration of $1.0 billion attributable to stock consideration of $994.2 million and the fair value of a previously held equity interest of $10.0 million. The Innovium acquisition was primarily intended to allow the Company to immediately participate in the fastest growing segment of the switch market with a cloud-optimized solution. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated August 2, 2021 (the \u201cInnovium merger agreement\u201d), the Company\u2019s common stock was issued in exchange for all outstanding equity of Innovium, including shares of Innovium\u2019s preferred and common stock, employee equity awards and warrants.\nThe factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill were based upon the Company\u2019s conclusion that there are strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the acquisition. Goodwill recorded for the Innovium acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe following table summarized the total merger consideration (in millions):\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP requirements for business combinations, the Company allocated the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d), generally based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. The Company\u2019s valuation assumptions of acquired assets and assumed liabilities require significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which such costs are incurred. See \u201cNote 8 - Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, Net\u201d for additional information.\nThe purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):\nThe Company incurred total acquisition related costs of $11.9 million which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nInphi\nOn April 20, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Inphi (the \u201cInphi acquisition\u201d). Inphi is a global leader in high-speed data movement enabled by optical interconnects. The Inphi acquisition was primarily intended to create an opportunity for the combined company to be uniquely positioned to serve the data-driven world, addressing high growth, attractive end markets such as cloud data center and 5G. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 29, 2020, by and among the Company and Inphi (the \u201cInphi merger agreement\u201d), the Company acquired all outstanding shares of common stock of Inphi for $66 per share in cash and 2.323 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock exchanged for each share of Inphi common stock. The merger consideration paid in cash was funded with a combination of cash on hand and funds from the Company\u2019s debt financing. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d for additional information.\nThe factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill were based upon the Company\u2019s conclusion that there are strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the acquisition. Goodwill recorded for the Inphi acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe following table summarized the total merger consideration (in millions):\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP requirements for business combinations, the Company allocated the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, generally based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. The Company\u2019s valuation assumptions of acquired assets and assumed liabilities require significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which such costs are incurred. See \u201cNote 8 - Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, Net\u201d for additional information.\nThe purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe provisional amounts presented in the table above pertained to the preliminary purchase price allocation reported in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended January 29, 2022. The measurement period adjustments were associated with a change in deferred tax assets as a result of changes in estimates related to finalizing Inphi\u2019s short period 2021 U.S. tax return. The Company does not believe that the measurement period adjustment had a material impact on its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets, or cash flows in any periods previously reported.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company incurred $50.8 million in acquisition related costs which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company also incurred $39.8 million of aggregate debt financing costs. As of January 28, 2023, $3.0 million is included in short-term debt, and $22.9 million is included in long-term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d for additional information. Additionally, the Company incurred $8.2 million of equity issuance costs, which were recorded in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets.\nUnaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Information\nThe unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the acquisitions had been completed on the date indicated, does not reflect synergies that might have been achieved, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions the Company believe are reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the combined results of operations for each of the periods presented, as if Innovium and Inphi had been acquired as of beginning of fiscal year 2021. The unaudited supplemental pro forma information includes adjustments to amortization and depreciation for acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense, the purchase accounting effect on inventories acquired, interest expense, and transaction costs. For fiscal year 2021, non-recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the Innovium and Inphi acquisitions in the pro forma information presented below included (i) stock-based compensation expense of $46.7 million, (ii) the purchase accounting effect of inventories acquired of $233.0 million, (iii) interest expense of $11.4 million, and (iv) transaction costs of $65.7 million. The unaudited supplemental pro forma information presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations of the combined business had the Inphi and Innovium acquisitions actually occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2021 or of the results of our future operations of the combined business.\nThe unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information for the periods presented is as follows (in millions):\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 8 - Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, Net\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.\nIn connection with the Innovium and Inphi acquisitions on October 5, 2021 and April 20, 2021, respectively, the Company recorded goodwill of $6.1 billion. In January 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a consulting services entity for purchase consideration of $41.8 million, primarily for the purpose of expanding engineering resources to address customer design opportunities, of which $25.5 million was allocated to goodwill.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company completed acquisitions of several companies for total purchase consideration of $103.2 million, of which $73.6 million was allocated to goodwill. The purpose of the acquisitions was to expand engineering resources staff to address customer design opportunities, access additional intellectual property and support expansion of the Company\u2019s networking solutions. The carrying value of total goodwill as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022 was $11.6 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively. See \u201cNote 7 - Business Combinations\u201d for discussion of acquisitions and changes to the carrying value of goodwill.\nThe Company has identified that its business operates as a single operating segment and as a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. The Company\u2019s annual test for goodwill impairment as of the last day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 did not result in any impairment charge.\nThere was no activity from acquisitions or divestitures recorded to goodwill in fiscal 2023 and 2022 other than those described above.\nAcquired Intangible Assets, Net\nIn connection with the Innovium acquisition on October 5, 2021, the Company acquired $433.0 million of intangible assets as follows (in millions, except for weighted-average useful life as of acquisition date):\nIn connection with the Inphi acquisition on April 20, 2021, the Company acquired $4.4 billion of intangible assets as follows (in millions, except for weighted-average useful life as of acquisition date):\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAs of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, net carrying amounts excluding fully amortized intangible assets are as follows (in millions, except for weighted-average remaining amortization period):\nThe intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, except for certain Cavium customer contracts and related relationships, which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization over the expected customer lives, which more closely align with the pattern of realization of economic benefits expected to be obtained. The IPR&D will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and will not be amortized until the underlying projects reach technological feasibility and commercial production at which point the IPR&D will be amortized over the estimated useful life. Useful lives for these IPR&D projects are expected to range between 5 to 10 years. In the event the IPR&D is abandoned, the related assets will be written off.\nAmortization for acquired intangible assets was $1.1 billion, $979.4 million and $443.6 million during the years ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021 respectively.\nThe following table presents the estimated future amortization expense of acquired amortizable intangible assets as of January 28, 2023 (in millions):\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 9 - Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nThe Company\u2019s Level 1 assets include marketable equity investments that are classified as other non-current assets and which are valued primarily using quoted market prices. The Company\u2019s Level 2 assets include time deposits, as the market inputs used to value these instruments consist of market yield. In addition, the severance pay fund is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nThe tables below set forth, by level, the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The tables do not include assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value (in millions):\nThe carrying value of investments in non-marketable equity securities recorded to fair value on a non-recurring basis is adjusted for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment. These securities relate to equity investments in privately-held companies. These items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the value is estimated based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs such as volatility, rights and obligations of the securities held. As of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, non-marketable equity investments had a carrying value of $36.1 million and $30.7 million, respectively, and are included in other non-current assets in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThere were no transfers of assets between levels in either fiscal 2023 or 2022.\nFair Value of Debt\nThe Company classified the 2024 and 2026 Term Loans, the 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes, 2028 Notes, and 2031 Notes as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The carrying value of the 2024 and 2026 Term Loans approximate their fair value as the 2024 and 2026 Term Loans are carried at a market observable interest rate that resets periodically. The estimated aggregate fair value of the unsecured senior notes was $2.7 billion at January 28, 2023 and $3.0 billion as at January 29, 2022, and were classified as Level 2 as there are quoted prices from less active markets for the notes. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d for additional information.\nNote 10 - Restructuring\nThe following table provides a summary of restructuring related charges as presented in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):\nThe following table presents details related to the restructuring related charges as presented in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):\nFiscal 2023. The Company recorded $21.6 million of restructuring related charges during its evaluation of its existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability. A restructuring plan was initiated during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (the \u201cFiscal 2023 Plan\u201d) in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. Restructuring charges are mainly comprised of severance and other one-time termination benefits, facility closures where sites may be redundant within the same region or no longer suitably sized for the local employee base, and other costs. The charges include $15.5 million related to the Fiscal 2023 Plan primarily from severance costs. The Company expects to complete these restructuring actions by the end of fiscal 2024.\nFiscal 2022. The Company recorded $31.6 million of restructuring related charges during its evaluation of its existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability. A restructuring plan was initiated during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 (the \u201cFiscal 2022 Plan\u201d) in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas as part of the integration of the acquisitions as described in \u201cNote 7 - Business Combinations.\u201d Restructuring charges are mainly comprised of severance and other one-time termination benefits, facility closures where sites may be redundant within the same region or no longer suitably sized for the local employee base, and other costs.

The Company transitioned its product offering from standard server processors to the broad server market to focus only on customized server processors for a few targeted customers. This change in strategy required the Company to assess whether the carrying value of the associated assets would be recoverable. As a result of the assessment, the Company determined the carrying amount of certain impacted assets were not recoverable, which resulted in recognition of $119.0 million of restructuring related charges associated with the server processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The charges included $50.3 million in impairment of acquired intangibles, $36.0 million in impairment of purchased IP licenses and $32.7 million in equipment and inventory impairment and other related restructuring charges.\nThe remaining restructuring charges of $61.4 million include approximately $36.9 million in severance and related costs and $24.5 million in other costs.

Prior to that, the Company consisted of a Bermuda parent holding company with various foreign and U.S. subsidiaries. The applicable statutory rate in the U.S. is 21% for the Company for fiscal 2023 and was 21% for the Company for fiscal 2022. The applicable statutory rate in Bermuda was zero for the Company for fiscal 2021. For purposes of the reconciliation between the provision (benefit) for income taxes at the statutory rate and the effective tax rate, a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 is applied as follows:\nThe income tax expense for fiscal 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the remeasurement of Singapore deferred taxes upon extension of the Company\u2019s tax incentive in Singapore, which is discussed in more detail below, tax benefits attributable to a net reduction of unrecognized tax benefits as a result of settled income tax audits in combination with the lapsing of statute of limitations, offset by foreign income inclusions in the U.S., and a tax expense related to the recapture of Israel corporate income taxes. The income tax expense for fiscal 2023 is also impacted by a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s earnings, or in some cases, losses being taxed or benefited at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, stock-based compensation tax benefits, and disallowed deductions related to non-deductible compensation.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA) changed the manner in which multinational companies are taxed on foreign operations. The 2017 TCJA also included a provision requiring the capitalization of R&D expenditures, which became effective as of the Company\u2019s fiscal 2023. The effect of these provisions, in tandem, results in a significant increase in foreign income inclusion in the U.S., which is predominantly offset by increased R&D credit utilization in the U.S., resulting in a release of valuation allowances associated with the R&D credits.\nThe income tax benefit for fiscal 2022 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits of stock-based compensation, offset by foreign income inclusions in the U.S. and non-deductible compensation. The tax benefits from stock-based compensation and increased foreign income inclusions in fiscal 2022 were primarily the result of the parent company being a US-based company during fiscal 2022, as opposed to a Bermuda-based company in prior years. The income tax benefit for fiscal 2021 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to pretax losses of subsidiaries with income tax rates that differ from the U.S. statutory tax rate, combined with a net reduction of unrecognized tax benefits inclusive of interest and penalties, offset by tax expense attributable to non-deductible compensation.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDeferred tax assets consist of the following (in millions):\nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on our consolidated balance sheet as follows:\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those assets become deductible or creditable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, weighing all positive and negative evidence, and provides or maintains a valuation allowance for these assets if it is more likely than not that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If negative evidence exists, sufficient positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed. The Company considers all available evidence such as its earnings history including the existence of cumulative income or losses, reversals of taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. In jurisdictions where the Company has cumulative losses, the Company has provided for a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. In the U.S., and in certain foreign jurisdictions, the Company has deferred tax assets for which partial valuation allowances have been established. After weighing all available evidence, particularly the earnings history and forecasts of future taxable income in each respective jurisdiction, as well as its history of tax credits expiring unused, the Company determined that negative evidence outweighed positive evidence with respect to the ability to realize federal, state, and foreign research and development and other tax credits, as well as certain other foreign deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance decreased by $41.7 million from fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of R&D credit utilization in the U.S. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on its U.S. R&D credits based on the factors listed above as well as forecasted R&D credit utilization and expected R&D credit generation in future years. In future periods, it is possible that significant positive or negative evidence could arise that results in a change in the Company\u2019s judgment with respect to the need for a valuation allowance, which could result in a tax benefit, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s income tax provision, in the period of such change in judgment.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAs of January 28, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income of approximately $846.8 million, $840.5 million, $212.5 million and $56.3 million for U.S. federal, state of California, other U.S. states, and foreign purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal year 2032, and the California carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal year 2027. The majority of the Company\u2019s foreign losses carry forward indefinitely. The Company also had federal research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately $470.6 million which begin to expire in fiscal 2024. As of January 28, 2023, the Company also had California research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $652.5 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, the Company has research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately $33.2 million in other U.S. states which begin to expire in fiscal 2024. The Company also has research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately $12.6 million in foreign jurisdictions which begin to expire in fiscal 2024. The Company\u2019s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to audit and adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations, or other facts and circumstances.\nUtilization of the Company\u2019s U.S. federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to ownership change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. Future changes in the Company\u2019s stock ownership, some of which are generally outside of the Company\u2019s control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 and Section 383 and result in a limitation on U.S. tax attributes. The Company has determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of its net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes.\nThe following table reflects changes in the unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nIncluded in the balances as of January 28, 2023 is $216.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective income tax rate if recognized. During the year ended January 28, 2023, the Company decreased its unrecognized tax benefits by $16.5 million primarily as a result of settled income tax audits. Of the gross unrecognized tax benefits in the table above, $297.2 million, $296.7 million, and $221.7 million are offset against deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively.\nThe amounts in the table above do not include related interest and penalties. The amount of interest and penalties accrued was approximately $3.2 million, $3.9 million, and $4.0 million as of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. The Company\u2019s policy is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. The consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 included accruals of $1.6 million, $0.6 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company\u2019s major tax jurisdictions are the United States, the states of California and Massachusetts, Singapore, China, India, Germany, and Israel. The Company is subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The examination of tax liabilities in each of these jurisdictions requires the interpretation and application of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws and regulations. As of January 28, 2023, the Company is subject to examination in material jurisdictions including China, India, Israel, Singapore, Germany, and the United States for fiscal years 2003 through 2023.\nDuring the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease significantly due to changes in tax law in various jurisdictions, new tax audits and changes in the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies within the next 12 months. Excluding these factors, uncertain tax positions may decrease by $1.9 million from the lapse of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions during the next 12 months.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Singapore Economic Development Board (\u201cEDB\u201d) initially granted a 10-year Pioneer Status in July 1999 to the Company\u2019s Singapore subsidiary. After the conclusion of the initial Pioneer status, the EDB granted an incentive known as the Development and Expansion Incentive (\u201cDEI\u201d) and extended the Pioneer status over multiple years. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the EDB agreed to extend the Company\u2019s DEI by five years, through June 30, 2029. As a result of the DEI extension, the Company\u2019s Singapore deferred taxes were remeasured based on their expected future reversals at a lower incentive tax rate, resulting in a $213.6 million reduction to our net deferred tax assets in Singapore and a corresponding increase in our deferred income tax expense in that period. To retain the current DEI tax benefits through June 2029 in Singapore, the Company must meet certain operating conditions, headcount and investment requirements, as well as maintain certain activities in Singapore. In fiscal 2023, no Singapore tax incentive net tax benefits were recorded. In fiscal 2022, tax savings associated with this tax incentive were approximately $11.8 million, which if paid would impact the Company\u2019s earnings per share by $0.01 per share. There was no such benefit in fiscal 2021.\nMarvell Israel (M.I.S.L) Ltd., is entitled to certain tax benefits under the Israeli Encouragement of Investments Law (\u201cEncouragement Law\u201d) Special Technology Enterprise Regime, which includes reduced corporate income tax rates, subject to various operating requirements and other conditions. In fiscal 2023, tax savings associated with this program were approximately $11.2 million, which if paid, would impact the Company\u2019s earnings per share by $0.01 per share in fiscal 2023. There was no tax benefit in fiscal 2022, and 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s principal source of liquidity as of January 28, 2023 consisted of approximately $911.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $642.0 million was held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability on $433.9 million of assets held by subsidiaries as such amounts are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company manages its worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by its foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States.\nNote 14 - Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company reports both basic net loss per share, which is based on the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period, and diluted net loss per share, which is based on the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period.\nThe computations of basic and diluted net loss per share are presented in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts):\nPotential dilutive securities include dilutive common stock from stock-based awards attributable to the assumed exercise of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan shares using the treasury stock method. Potential dilutive securities include dilutive common stock from stock-based awards attributable to the shares that could be issued upon conversion of the Company\u2019s convertible debt using the if-converted method. Under the treasury stock method and if-converted method, potential common stock outstanding are not included in the computation of diluted net income per share, if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAnti-dilutive potential shares are presented in the following table (in millions):\nAnti-dilutive potential shares from stock-based awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all periods reported above because either their exercise price exceeded the average market price during the period or the stock-based awards were determined to be anti-dilutive based on applying the treasury stock method. Anti-dilutive potential shares from convertible debt are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all periods reported above because the shares that would be issued upon conversion of the Company\u2019s convertible debt were determined to be anti-dilutive based on applying the if-converted method. Anti-dilutive potential shares from stock-based awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021 due to the net losses reported in those periods.\nNote 15 - Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates in one reportable segment - the design, development and sale of integrated circuits. The chief executive officer was identified as the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) and is ultimately responsible for and actively involved in the allocation of resources and the assessment of the Company\u2019s performance. The fact that the Company operates in only one reportable segment is based on the following:\n\u2022The Company uses a highly-integrated approach in developing its products in that discrete technologies developed by the Company are frequently integrated across many of its products. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s integrated circuits are manufactured under similar manufacturing processes.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s organizational structure is based along functional lines. Each of the functional department heads reports directly to the CODM. Shared resources in the Company also report directly to the CODM or to a direct report of the CODM.\n\u2022The assessments of performance across the Company, including assessment of the Company\u2019s incentive compensation plan, are based largely on operational performance and consolidated financial performance.\n\u2022The decisions on allocation of resources and other operational decisions are made by the CODM based on his direct involvement with the Company\u2019s operations and product development.\nThe following table presents long-lived asset information based on the physical location of the assets by geographic region (in millions):\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 16 - Supplemental Financial Information (in millions)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nShort-term, highly liquid investments of $150.7 million and $177.6 million as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively, included in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are not considered as investments because of the short-term maturity of such investments.\nThe inventory balance at January 29, 2022 includes $38.7 million related to the remaining inventory fair value adjustment from the Innovium acquisition.\nThe Company recorded depreciation expense of $126.8 million, $113.5 million and $95.9 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(1)Amortization of technology and other licenses was $189.5 million, $149.5 million and $99.3 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(1) Variable consideration estimates consist of estimated customer returns, price discounts, price protection, rebates, and stock rotation programs.\nMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss:\nThe changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, by components for the comparative period are presented in the following table (in millions):\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows",

Controls and Procedures\nManagement\u2019s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of January 28, 2023. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 28, 2023.\nManagement has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting consists of policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) are designed and operated to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and our process for the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed by, and under the supervision of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, management, and others. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023 using the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in \u201cInternal Control-Integrated Framework,\u201d issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO Criteria). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 28, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report that is included herein.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nChanges to Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nNo change in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended January 28, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. We adopted a hybrid work policy where most of our employees have the option to split their time between working from home and the office. In addition, we continue to monitor and assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness. We believe that our internal controls over financial reporting are being executed effectively and continue to be effective.",

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
