    "item_1": "Item 1.\nBusiness\nIncorporated in 1980, Lam Research Corporation (\u201cLam Research,\u201d \u201cLam,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Fremont, California. We maintain a network of facilities throughout Asia, Europe, and the United States in order to meet the needs of our dynamic customer base.\nAdditional information about Lam Research is available on our website at www.lamresearch.com. The content on any website referred to in this Form 10-K is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K unless expressly noted.\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q, Current Reports on Forms 8-K, Proxy Statements and all other filings we make with the SEC are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practical after we file them with or furnish them to the SEC and are also available online at the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov.\nThe Lam Research logo, Lam Research, and all product and service names used in this report are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Lam Research Corporation or its subsidiaries in the United States and/or other countries. All other marks mentioned herein are the property of their respective holders.\nWe are a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.\nOur customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers (\u201cIDMs\u201d) that make products such as non-volatile memory (\u201cNVM\u201d), dynamic random-access memory (\u201cDRAM\u201d), and logic devices. We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.\nSemiconductor manufacturing, our customers\u2019 business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits (\u201cICs\u201d) on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.\nDemand from cloud computing (the \u201cCloud\u201d), the Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d), and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional two-dimensional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like three-dimensional (\u201c3D\u201d) architectures as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks.\nWe believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with semi-ecosystem partners; (iv) our ability to identify and invest in the breadth of our product portfolio to meet technology inflections; and (v) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam\u2019s solutions to our customers.\nWe also address processes for back-end wafer-level packaging (\u201cWLP\u201d), which is an alternative to traditional wire bonding and can offer a smaller form factor, increased interconnect speed and bandwidth, and lower power consumption, among other benefits. In addition, our products are well-suited for related markets that rely on semiconductor processes and require production-proven manufacturing capability, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensors (\u201cCIS\u201d) and micro-electromechanical systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d).\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 4\nOur Customer Support Business Group (\u201cCSBG\u201d) provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability, and operational efficiency. We offer a broad range of services to deliver value throughout the lifecycle of our equipment, including customer service, spares, upgrades, and new and refurbished non-leading edge products in our deposition, etch, and clean markets. Many of the technical advances that we introduce in our newest products are also available as upgrades, which provide customers with a cost-effective strategy for extending the performance and capabilities of their existing wafer fabrication lines. Service offerings include addressing productivity needs for our customers including, but not limited to, system uptime or availability optimization, throughput improvements, and defect reduction. Additionally, within CSBG, our Reliant product line offers new and refurbished non-leading-edge products in deposition, etch and clean markets for those applications that do not require the most advanced wafer processing capability.\nProducts\nDeposition Processes and Product Families\nDeposition processes create layers of dielectric (insulating) and metal (conducting) materials used to build a semiconductor device. Depending on the type of material and structure being made, different techniques are employed. Electrochemical deposition creates the copper wiring (interconnect) that links devices in an integrated circuit (\u201cIC\u201d or \u201cchip\u201d). Plating of copper and other metals is also used for TSV and WLP applications. Tiny tungsten connectors and thin barriers are made with the precision of chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition, which adds only a few layers of atoms at a time. Plasma-enhanced CVD, high-density plasma CVD, and ALD are used to form the critical insulating layers that isolate and protect all of these electrical structures. Lastly, post-deposition treatments such as ultraviolet thermal processing are used to improve dielectric film properties.\nALTUS\u00ae Product Family\nTungsten deposition is used to form conductive features such as contacts, vias, and wordlines on a chip. These features are small, often narrow, and use only a small amount of metal, so minimizing resistance and achieving complete fill can be difficult. At these nanoscale dimensions, even slight imperfections can impact device performance or cause a chip to fail. Our ALTUS\u00ae systems combine CVD and ALD technologies to deposit the highly conformal films needed for advanced tungsten metallization applications. The Multi-Station Sequential Deposition architecture enables nucleation layer formation and bulk CVD fill to be performed in the same\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 5\nchamber (\u201cin situ\u201d). Our ALD technologies are used in the deposition of barrier films to achieve high step coverage with reduced thickness at lower temperatures relative to a conventional process.\nSABRE\u00ae Product Family\nCopper deposition lays down the electrical wiring for most semiconductor devices. Even the smallest defect - say, a microscopic pinhole or dust particle - in these conductive structures can impact device performance, from loss of speed to complete failure. The SABRE\u00ae ECD product family, which helped pioneer the copper interconnect transition, offers the precision needed for copper damascene manufacturing in logic and memory. System capabilities include cobalt deposition for logic applications and copper deposition directly on various liner materials, which is important for next-generation metallization schemes. For advanced WLP applications, such as forming conductive bumps and redistribution layers, and for filling TSVs, the SABRE\u00ae 3D family combines Lam\u2019s SABRE Electrofill\u00ae technology with additional innovation to deliver the high-quality films needed at high productivity. The modular architecture can be configured with multiple plating and pre/post-treatment cells, providing flexibility to address a variety of packaging applications.\nSOLA\u00ae Product Family\nDielectric materials designed to meet the insulation requirements of logic chips often have attributes that make them unusually difficult to use. These films are easily damaged and vulnerable to losing some of their insulating capability, which can lead to poor device performance. To enable these applications, some films can be stabilized - and others enhanced to improve device performance - using specialized post-deposition film treatments available with Lam\u2019s SOLA\u00ae UVTP product family. SOLA\u00ae products offer process flexibility through independent control of temperature, wavelength, and intensity at each station of the wafer path, enabled by Multi-Station Sequential Processing architecture.\nSPEED\u00ae Product Family\nDielectric gapfill processes deposit critical insulation layers between conductive and/or active areas by filling openings of various aspect ratios between conducting lines and between devices. With advanced devices, the structures being filled can be very tall and narrow. As a result, high-quality dielectric films are especially important due to the ever-increasing possibility of cross-talk and device failure. Our SPEED\u00ae HDP-CVD products provide a multiple dielectric film solution for high-quality gapfill with industry-leading throughput and reliability. SPEED\u00ae products have excellent particle performance, and their design allows large batch sizes between cleans and faster cleans.\nStriker\u00ae Product Family\nThe latest memory, logic, and imaging devices require extremely thin, highly conformal dielectric films for continued device performance improvement and scaling. For example, ALD films are critical for spacer-based multiple patterning schemes where the spacers help define critical dimensions, as well as for insulating liners and gapfill in high aspect ratio features, which have little tolerance for voids and even the smallest defect. The Striker\u00ae single-wafer ALD products provide dielectric film solutions for these challenging requirements through application-specific material, process and hardware options that deliver film technology and defect performance.\nVECTOR\u00ae Product Family\nDielectric film deposition processes are used to form some of the most difficult-to-produce insulating layers in a semiconductor device, including those used in the latest transistors and 3D structures. In some applications, these films require dielectric films to be exceptionally smooth and defect free since slight imperfections are multiplied greatly in subsequent layers. Our VECTOR\u00ae PECVD products are designed to provide the performance and flexibility needed to create these enabling structures within a wide range of challenging device applications. As a result of its design, VECTOR\u00ae produces superior thin film quality, along with exceptional within-wafer and wafer-to-wafer uniformity.\nEtch Processes and Product Families\nEtch processes help create chip features by selectively removing both dielectric (insulating) and metal (conducting) materials that have been added during deposition. These processes involve fabricating increasingly\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 6\nsmall, complex, and narrow features using many types of materials. The primary technology, reactive ion etch, bombards the wafer surface with ions (charged particles) to remove material. For the smallest features, atomic-layer etching (\u201cALE\u201d) removes a few atomic layers of material at a time. While conductor etch processes precisely shape critical electrical components like transistors, dielectric etch forms the insulating structures that protect conducting parts.\nFlex\u00ae Product Family\nDielectric etch carves patterns in insulating materials to create barriers between the electrically conductive parts of a semiconductor device. For advanced devices, these structures can be extremely tall and thin and involve complex, sensitive materials. Slight deviations from the target feature profile - even at the atomic level - can negatively affect electrical properties of the device. To precisely create these challenging structures, our Flex\u00ae product family offers differentiated technologies and application-focused capabilities for critical dielectric etch applications. Uniformity, repeatability, and tunability are enabled by a unique multi-frequency, small-volume, confined plasma design. Flex\u00ae offers in situ multi-step etch and continuous plasma capability that delivers high productivity with low defectivity.\nKiyo\u00ae Product Family\nConductor etch helps shape the electrically active materials used in the parts of a semiconductor device. Even a slight variation in these miniature structures can create an electrical defect that impacts device performance. In fact, these structures are so tiny that etch processes are pushing the boundaries of the basic laws of physics and chemistry. Our Kiyo\u00ae product family delivers the high-performance capabilities needed to precisely and consistently form these conductive features with high productivity. Proprietary Hydra technology in Kiyo\u00ae products improves critical dimension (\u201cCD\u201d) uniformity by correcting for incoming pattern variability, and atomic-scale variability control with production-worthy throughput is achieved with plasma-enhanced ALE capability.\nSyndion\u00ae Product Family\nPlasma etch processes used to remove single crystal silicon and other materials deep into the wafer are collectively referred to as deep silicon etch. These may be deep trenches for CMOS image sensors, trenches for power and other devices, TSVs, and other high aspect ratio features. These are created by etching through multiple materials sequentially, where each new material involves a change in the etch process. The Syndion\u00ae etch product family is optimized for deep silicon etch, providing the fast process switching with depth and cross-wafer uniformity control required to achieve precision etch results. The systems support both conventional single-step etch and rapidly alternating process, which minimizes damage and delivers precise depth uniformity.\nVersys\u00ae Metal Product Family\nMetal etch processes play a key role in connecting the individual components that form an IC, such as forming wires and electrical connections. These processes can also be used to drill through metal hardmasks that pattern features too small for conventional masks, allowing continued shrinking of feature dimensions. To enable these critical etch steps, the Versys\u00ae Metal product family provides high-productivity capability on a flexible platform. Superior CD and profile uniformity are enabled by a symmetrical chamber design with independent process tuning features.\nClean Processes and Product Families\nClean techniques are used between manufacturing steps to clear away particles, contaminants, residues and other unwanted material that could later lead to defects and to prepare the wafer surface for subsequent processing. Wet processing technologies can be used for wafer cleaning and etch applications. Plasma bevel cleaning is used to enhance die yield by removing unwanted materials from the wafer\u2019s edge that could impact the device area.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 7\nCoronus\u00ae Product Family\nBevel cleaning removes unwanted masks, residues, and films from the edge of a wafer between manufacturing steps. If not cleaned, these materials become defect sources. For instance, they can flake off and re-deposit on the device area during subsequent processes. Even a single particle that lands on a critical part of a device can ruin the entire chip. By inserting bevel clean processes at strategic points, these potential defect sources can be eliminated and more functional chips produced. By combining the precise control and flexibility of plasma with technology that protects the active die area, the Coronus\u00ae bevel clean family cleans the wafer\u2019s edge to enhance die yield. The systems provide active die area protection by using plasma processing with proprietary confinement technology. Applications include post-etch, pre- and post-deposition, pre-lithography, and metal film removal to prevent arcing during plasma etch or deposition steps.\nDV-Prime\u00ae, Da Vinci\u00ae, EOS\u00ae, and SP Series Product Families\nWafer cleaning is performed repeatedly during semiconductor device manufacturing and is a critical process that affects product yield and reliability. Unwanted microscopic materials - some no bigger than the tiny structures themselves - need to be cleaned effectively. At the same time, these processes must selectively remove residues that are chemically similar to the device films. For advanced WLP, the wet clean steps used between processes that form the package and external wiring have surprisingly complex requirements. These processes are called on to completely remove specific materials and leave other fragile structures undisturbed. In IoT products that include power devices, MEMS and image sensors, there is a unique requirement for wafer backside wet etch to uniformly thin the silicon wafer while protecting the device side of the wafer.\nBased on our pioneering single-wafer spin technology, the DV-Prime\u00ae and Da Vinci\u00ae products provide the process flexibility needed with high productivity to address a wide range of wafer cleaning steps throughout the manufacturing process flow. As the latest of Lam\u2019s wet clean products, EOS\u00ae delivers exceptionally low on-wafer defectivity and high throughput to address progressively demanding wafer cleaning applications, including emerging 3D structures. With a broad range of process capability, our SP Series products deliver cost-efficient, production-proven wet clean and silicon wet etch solutions for challenging WLP and IoT applications.\nMass Metrology Processes and Product\nMass metrology measures the change in mass following deposition, etch, and clean processes to enable monitoring and control of these often-repeated core manufacturing steps. For design components like thin film stacks, high aspect-ratio structures, and complex 3D architectures, optical techniques are limited in their ability to measure accurately the thick, deep, or otherwise visually obscured features. Measuring the change in mass for these applications provides a straightforward high-precision solution for monitoring and control of the critical features in advanced device structures, where there is often little tolerance for variation. Our line of high-precision mass metrology systems provides in-line monitoring and control of deposition, etch, and clean steps in real time - recording minute changes in mass to enable advanced detection of potential process excursions.\nMetryx\u00ae Product Family\nMetryx\u00ae mass metrology systems provide high precision in-line mass measurement for semiconductor wafer manufacturing. Nearly all semiconductor processes (e.g., deposition, etch and clean) either add or remove materials from the wafer. Measuring mass change of a wafer before and after a process therefore is a simple and direct means of monitoring and controlling the process. It is used to identify production wafer trends and excursions as they occur, allowing corrections to be implemented quickly to prevent further yield loss. It has been adopted in the production of 3D devices where traditional metrology and inspection techniques are insufficient for complex high aspect ratio device architectures. Mass metrology is also increasingly used to characterize multi-step processes and integrations for development, technology transfer, and diagnosis.\nFiscal Periods Presented\nAll references to fiscal years apply to our fiscal years, which ended June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019, and June 24, 2018.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 8\nResearch and Development\nThe market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product innovation. Our ability to achieve and maintain our competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers.\nWe believe current challenges for customers at various points in the semiconductor manufacturing process present opportunities for us. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our customers\u2019 product needs, support our growth strategy and enhance our competitive position.\nMarketing, Sales, and Service\nOur marketing, sales, and service efforts are focused on building long-term relationships with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet their needs. These efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions for their wafer processing needs. We maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of service engineers in place throughout the United States, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. We believe that comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace.\nWe provide standard warranties for our systems. The warranty provides that systems will be free from defects in material and workmanship and will conform to agreed-upon specifications. The warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement with new or like-new equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or non-conformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair. We also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to purchase as desired.\nInternational Sales\nA significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and, therefore, may be subject to certain risks, including but not limited to tariffs and other barriers; difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations; adverse tax consequences; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; changes in currency controls; compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions; and economic and political conditions. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations and cash flows. For geographical reporting, revenue is attributed to the geographic location in which the customers\u2019 facilities are located. Refer to Note 20 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report, for the attribution of revenue by geographic region.\nLong-lived Assets\nRefer to Note 20 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report, for information concerning the geographic locations of long-lived assets.\nCustomers\nOur customers include all of the world\u2019s leading semiconductor manufacturers. Customers continue to establish joint ventures, alliances, and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities. Customers accounting for greater than 10% of total revenues in fiscal year 2020 included Micron Technology, Inc.; Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Customers accounting for greater than 10% of total revenues in fiscal year 2019 included Micron Technology, Inc.; Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Toshiba Memory Holding Corporation (presently known as Kioxia Corporation). Customers accounting for greater than 10% of total revenues in fiscal year 2018 included Intel Corporation; Micron Technology, Inc.; Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Toshiba Memory Corporation (presently known as Kioxia Corporation).\nA material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition. Our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 9\nSemiconductor manufacturers\u2019 businesses, in turn, depend on many factors, including their economic capability, the current and anticipated market demand for ICs, and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand.\nBacklog\nIn general, we schedule production of our systems based upon our customers\u2019 delivery requirements and forecasts. In order for a system to be included in our backlog, the following conditions must be met: (1) we have received a written customer request that has been accepted, (2) we have an agreement on prices and product specifications, and (3) there is a scheduled shipment within the next 12 months. In order for spares and services to be included in our backlog, the following conditions must be met: (1) we have received a written customer request that has been accepted and (2) delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates, we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period, not to exceed 12 months, in calculating backlog amounts. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, changes in spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. As of June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019, our backlog was $2.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Generally, orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties. Because some orders are received and shipped in the same quarter and because customers may change delivery dates and cancel orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue levels for succeeding periods.\nManufacturing\nOur manufacturing operations mainly consist of assembling and testing components, sub-assemblies, and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers. The assembly and testing of our products is conducted predominately in cleanroom environments.\nWe have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing, production warehousing, and logistics functions. These outsourcing contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost-effective manner, enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business. We believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts. However, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. Overall, we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships. Refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report, for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments, reported as a component of purchase obligations.\nCertain components and sub-assemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier. We believe that, in many cases, we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these products. Nevertheless, any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations. We are currently not aware of any pending notices of violations, fines, lawsuits, or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have a material effect on our business. We believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to suspend production or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant additional equipment, or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 10\nEmployees\nAs of August 13, 2020, we had approximately 11,300 regular employees globally. Although we have employment-related agreements with a number of key employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued service. Each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the confidentiality of our non-public information. As noted previously, we outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing, field service, production warehousing, and logistics functions to provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost-effective manner, enabling us to respond quickly to any changes in our business.\nIn the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries, competition for highly skilled employees is intense. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees, particularly in the R&D and customer support functions.\nCompetition\nThe semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world. To compete effectively, we invest significant financial resources targeted to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally. Semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas, including but not limited to process performance, productivity, defect control, customer support, and overall cost of ownership, which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design, reliability, software advancements, and similar factors. Our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis. In addition, semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines. As a result, once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier\u2019s equipment and qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier\u2019s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base. Accordingly, we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor\u2019s equipment. We must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of high-quality and cost-efficient spare parts in the presence of competition from third-party spare parts providers.\nWe face significant competition with all of our products and services. Our primary competitor in the dielectric and metals deposition market is Applied Materials, Inc. For ALD and PECVD, we also compete against ASM International and Wonik IPS. In the etch market, our primary competitors are Applied Materials, Inc.; Hitachi, Ltd.; and Tokyo Electron, Ltd., and our primary competitors in the wet clean market are Screen Holding Co., Ltd.; Semes Co., Ltd.; and Tokyo Electron, Ltd.\nWe face competition from a number of established and emerging companies in the industry. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes, to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price/performance characteristics, and to provide more comprehensive offerings of products. If our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers, or other entities, covering products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected. Strategic investments to encourage local semiconductor manufacturing and supply chain in China could increase competition from domestic equipment manufacturers in China. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 11\nPatents and Licenses\nOur policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support activities. We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and applications covering various aspects of our products and processes. Our patents, which cover material aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years. We believe that, although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value, they alone will not determine our success. Our success depends principally upon our research and development, engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products, manufacturing techniques, and processes. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable to our products and processes. The sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d of this report.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nAs of August 13, 2020, the executive officers of Lam Research were as follows:\nTimothy M. Archer has been our president and chief executive officer since December 2018. Prior to this, he served as our president and chief operating officer, from January 2018 to November 2018. Mr. Archer joined us in June 2012 as our executive vice president, chief operating officer. Prior to joining us, he spent 18 years at Novellus Systems, Inc., (\u201cNovellus\u201d) in various technology development and business leadership roles, including most recently as chief operating officer from January 2011 to June 2012; executive vice president of Worldwide Sales, Marketing, and Customer Satisfaction from September 2009 to January 2011; and executive vice president of the PECVD and Electrofill Business Units from November 2008 to September 2009. His tenure at Novellus also included assignments as senior director of technology for Novellus Systems Japan from 1999 to 2001 and senior director of technology for the Electrofill Business Unit from April 2001 to April 2002. He started his career in 1989 at Tektronix, where he was responsible for process development for high-speed bipolar ICs. Mr. Archer completed the Program for Management Development at the Harvard Graduate School of Business and earned a B.S. degree in applied physics from the California Institute of Technology.\nDouglas R. Bettinger is our executive vice president, chief financial officer, and chief accounting officer with responsibility for Finance, Tax, Treasury, Information Technology, and Investor Relations.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201c2020 Form 10-K\u201d), the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Many of the following risk factors are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. As a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. No priority or significance is intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.\nThe Recent COVID-19 Outbreak Has Adversely Impacted, and May Continue to Adversely Impact, Our Business, Operations, and Financial Results\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and efforts by national, state and local governments worldwide to control its spread have resulted in widespread measures aimed at containing the disease such as quarantines, travel bans, shutdowns, and shelter in place or \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, which collectively have significantly restricted the movement of people and goods and the ability of businesses to operate. These restrictions and measures, incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, and suppliers, have affected and are affecting our business and operations by, among other things, causing facility closures, production delays and capacity limitations; disrupting production by our supply chain; disrupting the transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the implementation of business continuity plans; requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on-site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects; and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce. These impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause delays in product shipments and product development, increases in costs, and decreases in revenue, profitability and cash from operations, which have caused and are expected to cause an adverse effect on our results of operations that may be material. The potential duration and impact of the outbreak on the global economy and on our business are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty, but the outbreak has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets, increases in levels of unemployment, and economic uncertainty, which has adversely impacted our business and may continue to do so, and may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending, demand for our products, the ability of our customers to pay, our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers, and our access to external sources of financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 14\nThe Semiconductor Capital Equipment Industry Is Subject to Variability and Periods of Rapid Growth or Decline; We Therefore Face Risks Related to Our Strategic Resource Allocation Decisions\nThe semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand. The industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry. Variability in our customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results. The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices. The changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.\nDuring periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. If we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted. For example, the recent COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand for our products due to production, sourcing, logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines, shelter in place or \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, facility closures, workforce challenges, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.\nWe continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. If we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment, resulting in excess fixed costs.\nEspecially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.\nFuture Declines in the Semiconductor Industry, and the Overall World Economic Conditions on Which It Is Significantly Dependent, Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. With the consolidation of customers within the industry, the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers. The economic, political, and business conditions occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. Additionally, in times of economic uncertainty, our customers\u2019 budgets for our products, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. This would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. As a result, changing economic, political or business conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\na decline in demand for our products or services;\n\u2022\nan increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers\u2019 inability to pay us;\n\u2022\nan increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;\n\u2022\nvaluation allowances on deferred tax assets;\n\u2022\nrestructuring charges;\n\u2022\nasset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\na decline in the value of our investments;\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 15\n\u2022\nexposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;\n\u2022\na decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and\n\u2022\nchallenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.\nFluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues, operating results, and earnings. Where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in R&D and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.\nOur Revenues and Operating Results Are Variable\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter or year. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry;\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of orders from customers;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of the customer base, which may result in the investment decisions of one customer or market having a significant effect on demand for our products or services;\n\u2022\nprocurement shortages;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing difficulties;\n\u2022\ncustomer cancellations or delays in shipments, installations, customer payments, and/or customer acceptances;\n\u2022\nthe extent that customers continue to purchase and use our products and services in their business;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 reuse of existing and installed products, to the extent that such reuse decreases their need to purchase new products or services;\n\u2022\nchanges in average selling prices, customer mix, and product mix;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce, and market new, enhanced, and competitive products in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 introduction of new products;\n\u2022\nlegal or technical challenges to our products and technologies;\n\u2022\ntransportation, communication, demand, information technology, or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control, such as strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, widespread outbreak of illness, and natural or man-made disasters;\n\u2022\nlegal, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes (including but not limited to change in import/export regulations and tariffs) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in our estimated effective tax rate; and\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nFor example, the recent COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand for our products due to production, sourcing, logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines, shelter in place or \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, facility closures, workforce challenges, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 16\nThe Market for Our Common Stock Is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions or May Subject Our Business to Additional Costs\nThe market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. These factors include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\ngeneral market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;\n\u2022\neconomic or political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;\n\u2022\nvariations in our revenues, earnings, or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ncommercial success or failure of our new and existing products; or\n\u2022\ndisruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers.\nIn addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. These and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management\u2019s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our Common Stock.\nCertain Critical Information Systems, That We Rely on for the Operation of Our Business and Products That We Sell, Are Susceptible to Cybersecurity and Other Threats or Incidents\nWe maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include but are not limited to, telecommunications, the Internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, (some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer), network communications, and email. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers, or third parties such as vendors, contractors, customers and Cloud providers. In addition, we make use of Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers, or third-party networks and servers, all of which rely on networks, email and/or the Internet for their function. All of these information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure from various sources, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time. Those sources may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors, phishing schemes and other third-party attacks, and degradation or loss of service or access to data due to viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, or physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, or networking equipment.\nWe have experienced cybersecurity and other threats and incidents in the past. Although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect, we may incur material losses related to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents in the future. If we were subject to a cybersecurity and other incident, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such adverse effects might include:\n\u2022\nloss of (or inability to access, e.g. through ransomware) confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these critical information systems or transmitted to or from those systems;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of the proper function of our products, services and/or operations;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our or our customers\u2019 manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nerrors in the output of our work or our customers\u2019 work;\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 17\n\u2022\nthe loss or public exposure of the personal information of our employees, customers or other parties;\n\u2022\nthe public release of customer orders, financial and business plans, and operational results;\n\u2022\nexposure to claims from third parties who are adversely impacted by such incidents;\n\u2022\nMisappropriation or theft of our or a customer\u2019s, supplier\u2019s or other party's assets or resources, including technology data, intellectual property or other sensitive information and costs associated therewith;\n\u2022\nreputational damage;\n\u2022\ndiminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; or\n\u2022\nour failure to meet, or violation of, regulatory or other legal obligations, such as the timely publication or filing of financial statements, tax information and other required communications.\nWhile we have implemented ISO 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access control, and emergency recovery processes, and we carefully select our third-party providers of information systems, to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on, and to our technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information, those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents. It has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen. In addition, our policies and procedures may not be effective in enabling us to identify risks, threats and incidents in a timely manner, or at all, or to respond expediently, appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Have a Limited Number of Key Customers\nSales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict. In addition, large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing, increased costs, and/or lower margins for us; compliance with specific environmental, social, and corporate governance standards; and limitations on our ability to share technology with others. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results.\nWe Depend on Creating New Products and Processes and Enhancing Existing Products and Processes for Our Success; Consequently, We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change\nRapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips. That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development. In addition, the emergence of \u201cbig data\u201d and new tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence that capitalize on the availability of large data sets is leading semiconductor manufacturers and equipment manufacturers to pursue new products and approaches that exploit those tools to advance technology development. In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements. Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way. Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 18\nIn order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry. Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us. We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions. Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies. Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both. Moreover, customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next-generation devices. This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.\nWe Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification\nWe derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. Our products are priced up to approximately $15 million per system. As a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\na decline in demand for even a limited number of our products,\n\u2022\na failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products,\n\u2022\nexport restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets,\n\u2022\nan improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate,\n\u2022\nincreased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines,\n\u2022\nincreased pressure from regional competitors,\n\u2022\ntechnological changes that we are unable to address with our products, or\n\u2022\na failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.\nIn addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of \u201cbig data\u201d or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. Our business is affected by our customers\u2019 use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.\nStrategic Alliances and Customer Consolidation May Have Negative Effects on Our Business\nIncreasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale. The outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function and/or the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment, while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers\u2019 operations achieve economies of scale and/or increased purchasing\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 19\npower based on their higher volumes. In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes. Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.\nSimilarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. Even if they select our equipment, the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment, such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights, that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk. These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nWe Depend on a Limited Number of Key Suppliers and Outsource Providers, and We Run the Risk That They Might Not Perform as We Expect\nOutsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect.\nAlthough we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect, or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In some cases, the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. There is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products, and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships. For example, the recent COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations, supply chain, and customer support due to production, sourcing, logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines, \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, facility closures, workforce challenges, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.\nWe Face Risks Related to the Disruption of Our Primary Manufacturing Facilities\nWhile we maintain business continuity plans, our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations. These locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, widespread outbreaks of illness, terrorist activities, political or governmental unrest or instability, disruptions of our information technology resources, utility interruptions, or other events beyond our control. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results. For example, the recent COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations, supply chain, and customer support due to production, sourcing, logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines, \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, facility closures, workforce challenges, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.\nOur Future Success Depends Heavily on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations\nNon-U.S. sales, as reflected in Part II Item 7. Results of Operation of this 2020 Form 10-K, accounted for approximately 92%, 92%, and 93% of total revenue in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 20\nWe are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndomestic and international trade regulations, policies, practices, relations, disputes and issues;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international tariffs, export controls and other barriers;\n\u2022\ndeveloping customers and/or suppliers, who may have limited access to capital resources;\n\u2022\nglobal or national economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in currency controls;\n\u2022\ndifferences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nour ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts, and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;\n\u2022\nchanges in and compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including U.S. and international trade restrictions and sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, environmental, tax, and labor laws;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe need for technical support resources in different locations; and\n\u2022\nour ability to secure and retain qualified people, and effectively manage people, in all necessary\nlocations for the successful operation of our business.\nFor example, the recent COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our manufacturing operations, supply chain, and customer support due to production, sourcing, logistics and other challenges resulting from quarantines, \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, facility closures, workforce challenges, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.\nThere is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States, that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry. This would adversely affect our business with China, Japan, Korea, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy. A significant trade dispute, impact and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits.\nTariffs, export controls, additional taxes, trade barriers, sanctions, or the termination or modification of trade agreements, trade zones, and other duty mitigation initiatives, may increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. In addition, there are risks that foreign governments may, among other things, insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins.\nCertain of our international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. or foreign governments. Our inability to obtain such licenses, or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required, could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues.\nWe are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won. Currently, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro and Korean won. In addition, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third-party accounts receivables, accounts payables, and intercompany receivables and payables. We believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging these\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 21\nforeign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets, and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed), and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. Therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in these currencies.\nThe magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. Certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends, or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with onshore cash balances. Since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States, this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes.\nOur Sales to Customers in China, a Region of Growing Significance to Us, Could be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and China.\nChina represents a large and fast-developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to our business. Revenue in China represented approximately 31%, 22%, and 16% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The U.S. and China have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the two countries. In recent months, these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the U.S. government, which could potentially limit the market for our products and adversely impact our revenues. Specifically, on June 29, 2020, a new rule enacted by the U.S. Department of Commerce took effect that expands export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies in China that are designated as military end-users or have operations that could support military end uses. This rule may require us to apply for additional export licenses for our products to be sold to certain customers in China, and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we may apply for on a timely basis or at all. Although we do not currently anticipate a material adverse impact from this rule on our revenues in China, the impact of this rule is uncertain and could change. In addition, our international sales may also be impacted by export licensing requirements applicable to our customers and their products. On August 17, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce expanded a rule originally published on May 19, 2020 in a manner that could cause foreign-made wafers, chipsets, and certain related items produced with many of our products to be subject to U.S. licensing requirements if Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (\u201cHuawei\u201d) or its affiliates are parties to a transaction involving the items. This new rule does not impose additional export license requirements on our products, but it has the potential to adversely impact the demand for wafer fabrication equipment with U.S.-origin technology (potentially including many of our products) by customers that may intend to use such equipment to produce wafers, chipsets or certain related items when Huawei or its affiliates are expected to be parties to a transaction involving the items. The implementation, interpretation and impact on our business of these rules is uncertain and evolving, and these rules, other regulatory changes, and other actions taken by the governments of either the U.S. or China, or both, that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOnce a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor\u2019s Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitor\u2019s Equipment, Making It More Difficult for Us to Sell Our Equipment to That Customer\nSemiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 22\nWe Face a Challenging and Complex Competitive Environment\nWe face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures. Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.\nWe believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D. Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments. Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. In addition, we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do, allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match. In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.\nIn addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nOur Ability to Attract, Retain, and Motivate Key Employees Is Critical to Our Success\nOur ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies. This is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion, and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. Our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Tax Liabilities\nWe are subject to income, transaction, and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. The amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 23\nof deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. These factors could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States.\nWe Are Exposed to Various Risks from Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to various risks related to (1) new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (2) disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, and antitrust regulations, among others. Each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management\u2019s attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply.\nTo maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased selling, general, and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals. Failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to undertake remediation activities, suspend production, and/or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. Any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and ability to operate our business.\nWe May Fail to Protect Our Critical Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our Business\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other forms of protection. Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. As part of our strategy to protect our technology, we currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes, and techniques confidential and/or as trade secrets. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the U.S. or foreign governments issue to us; these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications; or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties\u2019 intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees. Additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued, or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the United States or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement. The rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications, or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. Moreover, because we selectively file for patent\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 24\nprotection in different jurisdictions, we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIntellectual Property, Indemnity, and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and We Could Lose Significant Rights That Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability\nThird parties may assert infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. From time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. In addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our Board of Directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. Moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.\nIf We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Businesses, Product Lines, and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance\nAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, enhance our technological capabilities, or accomplish other strategic objectives. As a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. For regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management\u2019s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel, or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our Common Stock.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 25\nWe May Incur Impairments to Goodwill or Long-lived Assets\nWe review our long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets identified in business combinations and other intangible assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our Common Stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If, in any period, our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets, this could also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations.\nOur valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur Leverage and Debt Service Obligations May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, and Earnings per Share\nWe have $5.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and convertible notes outstanding. Additionally, we have funding available to us under our $1.25 billion commercial paper program and our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional $600.0 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.85 billion. We may, in the future, decide to enter into additional debt arrangements.\nIn addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. We could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.\nOur indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrisk associated with the alternative reference rate reform (e.g. LIBOR transition);\n\u2022\nrisk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\na portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, or general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nimpairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. Furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows, to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.\nOur Credit Agreements Contain Covenant Restrictions That May Limit Our Ability to Operate Our Business\nWe may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 26\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets; and\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with any person.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Senior Notes, the Convertible Notes, or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nThere Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Declare Cash Dividends or Repurchase Our Shares at All or in Any Particular Amounts\nOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal, state, and international tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock.",

Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. During fiscal year 2020, our quarterly dividend was $1.15 per share.\nRepurchase of Company Shares\nIn November 2018, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of Common Stock on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, and this authorization was announced on January 23, 2019. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Funding for this share repurchase program may be through a combination of cash on hand, cash generation, and borrowings. As of June 28, 2020, we have purchased approximately $3.2 billion of shares under this authorization, $0.7 billion via open market trading and $2.5 billion utilizing accelerated share repurchase arrangements.\nAccelerated Share Repurchase Agreements\nOn November 22, 2019, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the \"November 2019 ASR\") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $1.0 billion of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 2.9 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on November 22, 2019. The total number of shares received under the November 2019 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the November 2019 ASR occurred during March 2020, resulting in the receipt of approximately 705 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $280.27 for the transaction period.\nOn June 4, 2019, we entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the \"June 2019 ASR\") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $750 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.1 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on June 4, 2019. The total number of shares received under the June 2019 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the agreements occurred during November 2019, resulting in the receipt of approximately 361 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $215.60 for the transaction period.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 29\nShare repurchases, including those under the repurchase program, were as follows:\n(1)\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 28, 2020, we acquired 380 thousand shares at a total cost of $109.6 million which we withheld through net share settlements to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards granted under our equity compensation plans. The shares retained by us through these net share settlements are not a part of the Board-authorized repurchase program but instead are authorized under our equity compensation plan.\n(2)\nAverage price paid per share excludes effect of accelerated share repurchases, see additional disclosure above regarding our accelerated share repurchase activity during the fiscal year.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 30\nCumulative Five-Year Return\nThe graph below compares Lam Research Corporation\u2019s cumulative five-year total shareholder return on Common Stock with the cumulative total returns of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Total Return Index, the Nasdaq Composite Total Return index, and the Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d) 500 (TR) index.

Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this 2020 Form 10-K and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Part I of this 2020 Form 10-K.)\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:\nExecutive Summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management\u2019s assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business.\nResults of Operations provides an analysis of operating results.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, and financial position.\nExecutive Summary\nLam Research Corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.\nOur customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as NVM, DRAM, and logic devices. We aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.\nSemiconductor manufacturing, our customers\u2019 business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 33\nindividual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.\nDemand from the Cloud, IoT, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical 3D scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks.\nWe believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. We have a broad portfolio of products that provide complementary processing steps used throughout semiconductor manufacturing. Our Customer Support Business Group focuses attention on delivery solutions that meet our customers\u2019 technical requirements as well as productivity needs during the equipment lifecycle. Several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners; and (iv) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam\u2019s solutions to our customers.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, customer demand remained relatively strong, however we experienced COVID-19-related production and supply chain disruptions, which impacted the timing of revenue recognition and negatively impacted our gross margin. While we are currently seeing improvements in both our own operations and those of our suppliers, risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain, which may negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. Over the longer term, while there are risks that the impact of COVID-19 to the broader macroeconomic environment may negatively impact our customer demand, we believe that secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable growth for our products and services, and that technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration will lead to an increase in our served addressable market for our products and services in deposition, etch, and clean.\nThe following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below:\nFiscal year 2020 revenue increased 4% compared to fiscal year 2019, reflecting stronger customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to customer and product mix as well as lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired through business combinations, partially offset by lower factory and field utilization. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was mainly driven by higher employee-related costs as a result of increased headcount and outsourcing services, partially offset by lower travel expense, miscellaneous costs and restructuring charges.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 34\nFiscal year 2019 revenue decreased 13% compared to fiscal year 2018, reflecting lower customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to lower factory utilization. The decrease in operating expenses in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was mainly driven by lower employee-related costs and amortization related to intangibles acquired through business combinations, partially offset by restructuring charges.\nOur cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $7.0 billion as of June 28, 2020, compared to $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2019. Cash flow provided from operating activities was $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2020 compared to $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2019. Cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2020 was primarily used for $1.4 billion in treasury stock purchases, $657 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, and $203 million of capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by $1.3 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt and $94 million of treasury stock reissuance and Common Stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nRevenue increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, but decreased compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily as a result of the variability of semiconductor capital investments by our customers. The overall Asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity investments for semiconductor manufacturing continued to occur in this region.\nThe deferred revenue balance was $537 million as of June 28, 2020 compared to $449 million as of June 30, 2019, driven primarily by additional deferrals towards the future servicing of our existing installed base and COVID-19-related production disruptions.\nThe percentage of leading- and non-leading-edge equipment and upgrade revenue to each of the markets we serve was as follows:\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 35\nGross Margin\nThe increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to customer and product mix as well as lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired through business combinations, partially offset by lower factory and field utilization.\nThe decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to lower factory utilization.\nResearch and Development\nWe continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, etch, clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing processes. The increase in R&D expense during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was mainly driven by an increase of $50 million in employee-related costs due to increased headcount, $19 million in outsourcing service costs, and $10 million in spending for supplies, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million in travel expense and $5 million in restructuring charges.\nR&D expense during fiscal year 2019 increased slightly compared to fiscal year 2018.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nThe decrease in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $17 million decrease in spending for customer-related sales costs, a $9 million decrease in spending for supplies, a $9 million decrease in restructuring charges, and a $6 million decrease in spending for travel and entertainment, partially offset by an increase of $25 million in spending for rent, repair and utilities.\nThe decrease in SG&A expense during fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a $65 million decrease in employee variable compensation and a $17 million decrease in amortization related to intangibles acquired through business combinations, partially offset by an increase of $10 million in depreciation and $8 million in restructuring charges.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 36\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net, consisted of the following:\nInterest income decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 as a result of lower yield, offset by a higher cash balance. Interest income increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 as a result of higher yield, offset by a lower cash balance.\nInterest expense increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due to the full-year impact of the issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes that occurred in fiscal year 2019 and the issuance of $2.0 billion senior notes in fiscal year 2020. The increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was also primarily due to the issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2019.\nThe gains on deferred compensation plan related assets in the periods presented were driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds.\nThe loss on impairment of investments during fiscal year 2018 is the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with our cash repatriation strategy following the December 2017 U.S. tax reform.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows:\nThe increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020, as outlined below.\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and its mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018.\nIn November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (\u201cNinth Circuit\u201d) rejected the en banc appeal petitioned by Altera Corporation (\u201cAltera\u201d) in July 2019. In that quarter, we evaluated the impact of the decision\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 37\nand viewed the denial as an indication that Altera\u2019s position of excluding stock-based compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing arrangement was unlikely to be sustained upon further litigation. As a result, we reversed $74.5 million of net tax assets associated with stock-based compensation benefits related to previous years in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 29, 2019 and we no longer reflected a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to excluding stock-based compensation from our inter-company cost-sharing arrangement. In February 2020, Altera petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States (\"SCOTUS\") to hear their case. In June 2020, the SCOTUS denied the petition.\nInternational revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States. International pre-tax income is taxable in the United States at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate. Please refer to Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets were $575 million and $471 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $196 million and $160 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $245 million and $227 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in the gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2020 and 2019 is primarily due to increases in outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries, tax credits, and operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and decreases in prepaid cost sharing.\nAs of our fiscal year ended June 28, 2020, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in California. The valuation allowances were $245 million and $227 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates include:\n\u2022\nthe recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue;\n\u2022\nthe valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;\n\u2022\nthe valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;\n\u2022\nthe recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; and\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 38\n\u2022\nthe valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. See Note 2, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition: On June 25, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 (\u201cASC 606\u201d) - Revenue From Contracts with Customers which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry specific guidance.\nWe recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below.\nIdentify the contract with a customer. We generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. In addition, our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.\nDetermine the transaction price. The transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. We generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. Our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies.\nRecognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.\nInventory Valuation: Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management\u2019s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include but are not limited to management\u2019s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.\nWarranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 39\nthose differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.\nIncome Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\nLong-lived Assets: We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. In our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. We do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying amount.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.\nIn estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.\nAs a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our Common Stock price and resulting market capitalization, to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. Further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 40\nFor other long-lived assets, we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset\u2019s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset\u2019s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. In addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we derecognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3, \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements,\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTotal gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $7.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 compared to $5.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and the issuance of $2.0 billion of senior notes, partially offset by Common Stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program and dividends paid.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $2.1 billion during fiscal year 2020 consisted of (in thousands):\nSignificant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $642 million, inventories of $412 million, and prepaid assets of $14 million; partially offset by sources of cash: increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $211 million, accounts payable of $208 million, and deferred profit of $76 million.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities during fiscal year 2020 was $244 million, primarily consisting of capital expenditures of $203 million.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2020 was $624 million, primarily consisting of $1.4 billion in Common Stock repurchases, $657 million of dividends paid, partially offset by $1.3 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt, and $94 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 41\nLiquidity\nGiven that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 28, 2020, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. However, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.\nIn the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt, operating leases and finance leases which are outlined in the following table. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as purchase obligations in the table. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 28, 2020, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date.\nThe amounts in the table below exclude $439 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion. The amounts in the table below also exclude $12 million associated with funding commitments related to non-marketable equity investments as we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of capital calls.\n(1)\nThe conversion period for the 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041 (the \u201c2041 Notes\u201d) was open as of June 28, 2020, and as such the net carrying value of the 2041 Notes is included within current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The principal balances of the 2041 Notes are reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. See Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K for additional information concerning the 2041 Notes and associated conversion features.\n(2)\nWe may choose to apply existing tax credits, thereby reducing the actual cash payment.\n(3)\nCertain tax-related liabilities and post-retirement benefits classified as other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are included in the \u201cMore than 5 Years\u201d category due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 42\nfuture payments. Additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities and the long-term portion of operating leases.\nOperating Leases\nWe lease most of our administrative, R&D, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located in Fremont and Livermore, California; Tualatin, Oregon; and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. In addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our Fremont and Livermore facility leases of up to $250 million. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion.\nFinancing Leases\nFinancing leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 28, 2020, under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the December 2017 quarter, a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $991 million, was recognized associated with the December 2017 U.S. tax reform. In accordance with SAB 118, we finalized the amount of the transition tax during the period ended December 23, 2018. The final amount was $868.4 million. We elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years with 8% of the transition tax to be paid each September 15 for years 2018 through 2022, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid each September 15 for years 2023 through 2025.\nLong-Term Debt\nOn May 5, 2020, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes due June 15, 2030 (the \u201c2030 Notes\u201d), $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes due June 15, 2050 (the \u201c2050 Notes\u201d), and $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes due June 15, 2060 (the \u201c2060 Notes\u201d). We will pay interest at an annual rate of 1.90%, 2.875%, and 3.125%, on the 2030, 2050, and 2060 Notes, respectively, on a semi-annual basis on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning December 15, 2020.\nOn March 4, 2019, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes due March 15, 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d), $1 billion aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes due March 15, 2029 (the \u201c2029 Notes\u201d), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes due March 15, 2049 (the \u201c2049 Notes\u201d). We pay interest at an annual rate of 3.75%, 4.00%, and 4.875%, respectively on the 2026, 2029 and 2049 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year.\nOn June 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due June 15, 2021, (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d). We pay interest at an annual rate of 2.80% on the 2021 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on June 15 and December 15 of each year.\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 43\nMarch 15, 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d). We pay interest at an annual rate of 3.80% on the 2025 Notes, on a semi-annual basis on March 15 and September 15 of each year. During the year ended June 28, 2020, $500 million principal value of 2020 Notes were settled upon maturity.\nWe may redeem the 2021, 2025, 2026, 2029, 2030, 2049, 2050, and 2060 Notes (collectively the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (\u201cpar\u201d), plus a \u201cmake whole\u201d premium as described in the indenture in respect to the Senior Notes and accrued and unpaid interest before May 15, 2021 for the 2021 Notes, before December 15, 2024 for the 2025 Notes, before January 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes, before December 15, 2028 for the 2029 Notes, before March 15, 2030 for the 2030 Notes, before September 15, 2048 for the 2049 Notes, before December 15, 2049 for the 2050 Notes, and before December 15, 2059 for the 2060 Notes. We may redeem the Senior Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after May 15, 2021 for the 2021 Notes, on or after December 24, 2024 for the 2025 Notes, on or after January 15, 2026 for the 2026 Notes, on or after December 15, 2028 for the 2029 Notes, on or after March 15, 2030 for the 2030 Notes, on or after September 15, 2048 for the 2049 Notes, on or after December 15, 2049 for the 2050 Notes, and on or after December 15, 2059 for the 2060 Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2041. We pay cash interest on the 2041 Notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. The 2041 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our Common Stock.\nWe may redeem the 2041 Notes on or after May 21, 2021 at a price equal to outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest if the last reported sales price of common shares has been equal to or more than 150% of the then applicable conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the redemption notice date.\nDuring the quarter-ended June 28, 2020, the market value of our Common Stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2041 Notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. As a result, the 2041 Notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal year 2020. As of June 28, 2020, $48.5 million of the 2041 notes remain outstanding, as a result of cumulative conversion activity.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, 2019, and 2018, we made $668 million, $117 million, and $753 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and finance/capital leases.\nRevolving Credit Arrangements\nOn March 12, 2014, the Company established an unsecured Credit Agreement. This agreement was amended on November 10, 2015 (the \u201cAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), October 13, 2017 (the \u201c2nd Amendment\u201d), and February 25, 2019 (the \u201c3rd Amendment\u201d). Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended by the 2nd and 3rd Amendment), the Company has a revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion with a syndicate of lenders with an expansion option that will allow the Company, subject to certain requirements, to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $600 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.85 billion. The facility matures on October 13, 2022.\nInterest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (1) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5%, or (2) LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our credit rating. The Amended Credit Agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default. As of June 28, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and were in compliance with all financial covenants.\nLIBOR is currently expected to be discontinued by the end of calendar year 2021. We expect to amend the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement prior to that occurrence to provide for an alternative reference interest\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 44\nrate plus an appropriate spread that approximates the existing reference interest rate as calculated in accordance with LIBOR. Despite the current expectations, we cannot be sure when LIBOR is discontinued, that we will be able to reach an agreement with the administrative agent under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on an alternate reference interest rate plus an appropriate spread, or that changes to the determination of interest under our agreements would approximate the current calculation in accordance with LIBOR. If we should fail to reach agreement with the administrative agent on an alternate reference interest rate prior to such time as LIBOR is unavailable as a reference rate, then the borrowings will bear interest at a base rate determined in accordance with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement tied to either the prime rate or federal funds rate, plus a spread.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOn November 13, 2017, we established a commercial paper program (the \u201cCP Program\u201d) under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.25 billion. Individual maturities may vary but cannot not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The net proceeds from the CP Program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our Common Stock from time to time under our stock repurchase program. If at any time, funds are not available under favorable terms under the CP Program, we may utilize the Amended Credit Agreement for funding. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is backstopped by our Revolving Credit Arrangement. As of June 28, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under the CP Program.\nOther Guarantees\nWe have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 28, 2020, we had not recorded any liability on our Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.\nGenerally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.\nWe provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 28, 2020, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $59 million. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid.\nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, consistent with our Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation; and under local law, we may be required to provide indemnification to our employees for actions within the scope of their employment. Although we maintain insurance contracts that cover some of the potential liability associated with these indemnification agreements, there is no guarantee that all such liabilities will be covered. We do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under such indemnification agreements or statutory obligations.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 45",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInvestments\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June 28, 2020, our mutual funds are classified as trading securities. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Any material differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities is recognized as \u201cOther income (expense)\u201d in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of our other investments are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.\nInterest Rate Risk\nFixed-Income Securities\nOur investments in various interest-earning securities carry a degree of market risk for changes in interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed-income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We target a capital preservation-focused investment policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our capital by limiting default risk, market risk, reinvestment risk, and concentration risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed-income securities that would result from selected potential decreases and increases in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (\u201cBPS\u201d), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS with a minimum interest rate of zero BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 28, 2020,were as follows:\nWe mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 46\nLong-Term Debt\nAs of June 28, 2020, we had $5.8 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $7.0 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors due to the convertible feature, as applicable. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Additionally, the fair value of the 2041 Notes will increase as our Common Stock price increases and decrease as our Common Stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.\nEquity Price Risk\nPublicly Traded Securities\nThe values of our investments in publicly traded securities, including mutual funds related to our obligations under our deferred compensation plans, are subject to market price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our publicly traded securities that would result from potential decreases and increases in the price of each security in the portfolio. Potential fluctuations in the price of each security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, or 25% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of June 28, 2020, were as follows:\nForeign Currency Exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) Risk\nWe conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily on revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won.\nTo protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and Korean won, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. The option contracts include collars, an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and Japanese yen notional amounts but with different strike prices. These foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts\u2019 gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items. The notional amount and unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 47\ndesignated as cash flow hedges, as of June 28, 2020, are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent.\nThe notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges, as of June 28, 2020, are shown in the table below. This table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges, assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net, by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 48",

Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers\u2019 business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.\nThe Company sells its products and services primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan.\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Today\u2019s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns, such as electronics demand, memory pricing, and foundry utilization rates, may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for the Company\u2019s equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including, but not limited to economic conditions; supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors; customer capacity requirements; and the Company\u2019s ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, the Company\u2019s results of operations for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.\nNote 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be applicable and evaluates them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition: On June 25, 2018, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 (ASC 606) - Revenue From Contracts with Customers which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry specific guidance.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation, as further described below.\nIdentify the contract with a customer. The Company generally considers documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. In addition, customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.\nDetermine the transaction price. The transaction price for the Company\u2019s contracts with its customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 57\nfuture usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. The Company generally invoices customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. The Company\u2019s contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies.\nRecognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.\nInventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers at the physical transfer of the products to the freight carriers. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers occurs at the time of customer acceptance.\nManagement evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. The Company\u2019s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management\u2019s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Estimates of market value include but are not limited to management\u2019s forecasts related to the Company\u2019s future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company\u2019s projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which the revision is made.\nWarranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the system. The Company provides standard warranties for its systems. The Company records a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when it recognizes revenue. The Company does not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis.\nWhile the Company periodically monitors the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than its estimates, the Company may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the Company offers customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred.\nEquity-based Compensation - Employee Stock Plans: The Company recognizes the fair value of equity-based compensation expense. The Company determines the fair value of its RSUs, excluding market-based performance RSUs, based upon the fair market value of Company\u2019s Common Stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends. The Company estimates the fair value of its market-based performance RSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The Company amortizes the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the award, and the Company has elected to use the straight-line method of amortization.\nIncome Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 58\nassets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of its net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company believes it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that the Company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company\u2019s policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets: The valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Each component of the Company for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit. All goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is assigned to the Company\u2019s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit. The Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. The Company amortizes intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and the Company reviews for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nThe Company reviews goodwill at least annually for impairment. If certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, the Company would perform an impairment test at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, the Company (1) allocates goodwill to its reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates, (2) estimates the fair value of its reporting units, and (3) determines the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process R&D and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. In the Company\u2019s goodwill impairment process, it first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. The Company does not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the Company determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company performs an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of its fourth fiscal quarter. The Company did not record impairments of goodwill during the years ended June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019, or June 24, 2018.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units by using an income approach. Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.\nIn estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company makes estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of its reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although the Company\u2019s cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates it is using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. In addition, the Company makes certain judgments\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 59\nabout allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of its reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.\nAs a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of the Company\u2019s goodwill balance in future periods, including but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or failure of the Company to reach its internal forecasts, which could impact the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of its reporting units and (2) a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and resulting market capitalization and to the extent the Company determines that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units below their carrying value. Further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill): The Company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. If such indicators are present, the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals, or other methods. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset\u2019s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset\u2019s new carrying value, which the Company depreciates over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. For the periods presented, there was no impairment of long-lived assets. In addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we derecognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows.\nFiscal Year: The Company follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting calendar, and its fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of June each year. The Company\u2019s most recent fiscal years ended June 28, 2020 and June 24, 2018, each included 52 weeks, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 included 53 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash Equivalents and Investments: Investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. The Company also invests in certain mutual funds, which include equity and fixed- income securities, related to its obligations under its deferred compensation plan, and such investments are classified as trading securities on the consolidated balance sheets. All of the Company\u2019s other investments are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates. The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities are recognized as \u201cOther income (expense)\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities is presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are charged against other income (expense) when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. The Company considers several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary. These factors include but are not limited to (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position, and (4) the Company\u2019s ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The Company\u2019s ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect its results of operation. An other-than-temporary impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the security, it is more-likely-than-not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery, or the security is not expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Other-than-temporary impairments attributed to credit losses are recognized in the income statement. The specific identification method is used to determine the realized gains and losses on investments. The Company recorded a $42.5 million other-than-temporary impairment charge during the year ended June 24, 2018. No other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized during the years ended June 28, 2020 or June 30, 2019.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 60\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where specific invoices are deemed uncollectible, the Company provides a specific allowance for bad debt against the amount due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected. The Company also provides allowances based on its write-off history. Bad debt expense was not material for fiscal years ended June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019, and June 24, 2018.\nProperty and Equipment: Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally five years. Software is amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Buildings are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally twenty-five years. Leasehold improvements are generally amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the related asset or the term of the underlying lease. Amortization of finance leases is included with depreciation expense.\nDerivative Financial Instruments: In the normal course of business, the Company\u2019s financial position is routinely subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company\u2019s policy is to mitigate the effect of these exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated business exposures. The Company has a policy that allows the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted revenue and expenses and net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in various foreign currencies. The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on the balance sheet at their fair values. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company does not believe that it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its interest rate and foreign currency hedges, as counterparties are large, global and well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company\u2019s exposures are in liquid currencies (Japanese yen, euros, Korean won, Taiwanese dollars, Chinese renminbi, Swiss franc, British pound sterling, Singapore dollars, Indian rupee, and Malaysian ringgit), so there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain the Company\u2019s hedging program would not be available in the future.\nTo hedge foreign currency risks, the Company uses foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts, where possible and prudent. These hedge contracts are valued using standard valuation formulas with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from existing exchange rates, interest rates, and other market factors.\nThe Company considers its most current forecast in determining the level of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses to hedge as cash flow hedges. The Company combines these forecasts with historical trends to establish the portion of its expected volume to be hedged. The revenue and expenses are hedged and designated as cash flow hedges to protect the Company from exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the related hedge gains and losses on the cash flow hedge are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations at that time.\nLeases: Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company includes renewals and terminations in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and liability when the provision is reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments when the rate implicit in the lease is unknown.\nThe Company has elected the following practical expedients and accounting policy elections for accounting under ASC 842: (i) leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; and (ii) lease and non-lease components of a contract are accounted for as a single lease component.\nGuarantees: The Company has certain operating leases that contain provisions whereby the properties subject to the operating leases may be remarketed at lease expiration. The Company has guaranteed to the lessor an amount approximating the lessor\u2019s investment in the property. Also, the Company\u2019s guarantees generally include certain indemnifications to its lessors under operating lease agreements for environmental matters, potential overdraft protection obligations to financial institutions related to one of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries,\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 61\nindemnifications to the Company\u2019s customers for certain infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by its products and services, indemnifications for its officers and directors, and the Company\u2019s warranty obligations under sales of its products.\nForeign Currency Translation: The Company\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment, where that local currency is the functional currency, primarily generate and expend cash in their local currency. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these local functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the fiscal period-end exchange rate, and income and expense accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using average rates in effect for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments and are a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Translation adjustments are recorded in other income (expense), net, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.\nNote 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \u201cLeases.\u201d The amendment establishes the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. In January 2018 and July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01 and ASU 2018-11 amending the effects of ASU 2016-02, which in combination with ASU 2016-02 were codified as Accounting Standard Codification topic 842 (\u201cASC 842\u201d). The Company adopted ASC 842 on the first day of the current fiscal year, July 1, 2019, under the modified-retrospective approach, applying the amendments to prospective reporting periods. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the historic accounting under ASC 840.\nThe Company elected the package of practical expedients that allowed the Company not to reassess (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases; (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct lease costs for existing leases. The Company did not elect to use hindsight in connection with the adoption of ASC 842.\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 by recording operating right-of-use assets of $110.8 million, net of deferred rent liabilities of $3.0 million that were reclassified to operating right-of-use assets, and operating lease liabilities of $113.8 million. The Company also recognized an adjustment of $3.0 million to retained earnings, net of tax; a reduction of $40.4 million to property and equipment, net; and a reduction of $43.8 million to finance leases ($42.3 million of which was previously recognized in long-term debt and finance lease obligations, less current portion and the remaining was previously recognized in current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations) related to its de-recognition of its previously recorded build-to-suit arrangements. The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations and had no impact on cash flows.\nUpdates Not Yet Effective\nIn June 2016, the FASB released ASU 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses.\u201d The amendment revises the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of losses on financial instruments, including but not limited to, available for sale debt securities and accounts receivable. The FASB issued a subsequent amendment to the initial guidance in November 2019 within ASU 2019-11. The Company is required to adopt these amendments starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a modified-retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, \"Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808).\u201d The amendment clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under Topic 606 when the counterparty is a customer for a good or service that is a distinct unit of account. The amendment also precludes entities from presenting consideration from transactions with a collaborator that is not\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 62\na customer together with revenue recognized from contracts with customers. The Company is required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The standard should be applied retrospectively to the period when the Company initially adopted ASC 606. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04,\u201dCodification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments\u201d, that clarifies and improves areas of guidance related to the recently issued standards on credit losses (ASU 2016-13), hedging (ASU 2017-12), and recognition and measurement of financial instruments (ASU 2016-01). The amendments generally have the same effective dates as their related standards. If already adopted, the amendments of ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2016-13 are effective starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\u201d The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. This ASU may be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company expects to adopt this guidance and apply it to reference rate reform effected arrangement modifications.\nNote 4: Revenue\nDeferred Revenue\nRevenue of $408.8 million included in deferred profit at June 30, 2019 was recognized during fiscal year 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the transaction price for contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue as of June 28, 2020 and when the Company expects to recognize the amounts as revenue:\n(1)\nThis amount is reported in Deferred profit on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as the customers can demand the liability to be performed at any time.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s revenue disaggregated between system and its customer-support related revenue:\nSystem revenue includes sales of new leading-edge equipment in deposition, etch and clean markets.\nCustomer support-related revenue includes sales of customer service, spares, upgrades, and non-leading-edge equipment from the Company\u2019s Reliant product line.\nThe Company operates in one reportable business segment: manufacturing and servicing of wafer processing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Refer to Note 20 - Segment, Geographic Information, and Major\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 63\nCustomers; for additional information regarding the Company\u2019s evaluation of reportable business segments and the disaggregation of revenue by the geographic regions the Company operates in.\nAdditionally, the Company serves three primary markets: memory, foundry, logic/integrated device manufacturing. The following table presents the percentages of leading- and non-leading-edge equipment and upgrade revenue to each of the primary markets we serve:\nNote 5: Equity-based Compensation Plans\nThe Company has stock plans that provide for grants of equity-based awards to eligible participants, including stock options and restricted stock units, of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. An option is a right to purchase Common Stock at a set price. An RSU award is an agreement to issue a set number of shares of Common Stock at the time of vesting. The Company\u2019s options and RSU awards typically vest over a period of three years or less. The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to purchase its Common Stock at a discount through payroll deductions.\nThe Lam Research Corporation 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, and the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively the \u201cStock Plans\u201d), provide for the grant of non-qualified equity-based awards to eligible employees, consultants and advisors, and non-employee directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2015 Stock Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders authorizing up to 18,000,000 shares available for issuance under the plan. Additionally, 1,232,068 shares that remained available for grants under the Company\u2019s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan were added to the shares available for issuance under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. As of June 28, 2020, there were a total of 8,909,055 shares available for future issuance under the Stock Plans. New shares are issued from the Company\u2019s balance of authorized Common Stock from the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan to satisfy stock option exercises and vesting of awards.\nThe Company recognized the following equity-based compensation expense and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nThe estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s equity-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards\u2019 vesting terms on a straight-line basis.\nRestricted Stock Units\nDuring the fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company issued both service-based RSUs and market-based performance RSUs (\u201cPRSUs\u201d). Market-based PRSUs generally vest three years from the grant date if certain performance criteria are achieved and require continued employment. Based upon the terms of such awards, the number of shares that can be earned over the performance periods is based on the Company\u2019s Common Stock price performance compared to the market price performance of a designated benchmark index, ranging from\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 64\n0% to 150% of target. The designated benchmark index was the Philadelphia Semiconductor Total Return Index (\u201cXSOX\u201d) for market-based PRSUs issued in 2020 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index (\u201cSOX\u201d) for market-based PRSUs issued in 2019 and 2018. The stock price performance or market price performance is measured using the closing price for the 50-trading days prior to the dates the performance period begins and ends. The target number of shares represented by the market-based PRSUs is increased by 2% of target for each 1% that Common Stock price performance exceeds the market price performance of the designated benchmark index. Market-based PRSUs issued in 2020 utilized the XSOX, as adjusted for the reinvestment of dividends on Common Stock on the ex-dividend date, whereas market-based PRSUs issued in 2019 and 2018 utilized the SOX which excluded the impact of dividends. The result of the vesting formula is rounded down to the nearest whole number. Total stockholder return is a measure of stock price appreciation in this performance period.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock activity:\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s service-based RSUs was calculated based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends. Shares granted for market-based PRSUs includes both shares newly granted during the fiscal year, as well as adjustments to previous grants resulting from actual market price performance; total approximate number of shares newly granted were as follows for fiscal years ended June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019 and June 24, 2018; 86,000, 134,000, and 149,000, respectively.\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s market-based PRSUs granted during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award:\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 65\nAs of June 28, 2020, the Company had $293.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to all unvested RSUs granted which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of 2.2 years.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity:\nAs of June 28, 2020 the options outstanding had a weighted-average remaining life of 4.2 years and a weighted-average exercise price of $144.63. As of June 28, 2020, the Company had 243,541 exercisable options outstanding with a weighted-average remaining life of 3.2 years and a weighted-average exercise price of $110.77.\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s stock options granted during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award:\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 66\nThe year-end intrinsic value relating to stock options for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 is presented below:\nAs of June 28, 2020, the Company had $6.8 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted and outstanding which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of 2.2 years.\nESPP\nThe Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) which allows employees to designate a portion of their base compensation to be deducted and used to purchase the Company\u2019s Common Stock at a purchase price per share of the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the Company\u2019s Common Stock on the first or last day of the applicable purchase period. Typically, each offering period lasts twelve months and comprises one interim purchase date.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, approximately 512 thousand shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock were sold to employees under the ESPP. At June 28, 2020, approximately 6.4 million shares were available for purchase under the ESPP, and the Company had $30.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP which is expected to be recognized over a remaining period of ten months.\nNote 6: Other Expense, Net\nThe significant components of other expense, net, were as follows:\nInterest income in the year ended June 28, 2020, decreased compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, as a result of lower yield, offset by a higher cash balance. Interest income increased in the year ended June 30, 2019, compared to the year ended June 24, 2018, as a result of a higher yield, offset by a lower cash balance.\nInterest expense in the year ended June 28, 2020, increased compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to the full year impact of the issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes that occurred in fiscal year 2019 and issuance of the $2.0 billion senior notes in fiscal year 2020. The increase in interest expense in the year ended June 30, 2019, compared to the year ended June 24, 2018, was also due to the issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2019, offset by conversions of the 2041 Convertible Notes and the retirement of the 2018 Convertible Notes in May 2018.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 67\nThe gains on deferred compensation plan related assets in the years presented were driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds.\nThe loss on impairment of investments in the year ended June 24, 2018 was the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with the Company\u2019s cash repatriation strategy following the December 2017 U.S. tax reform.\nNote 7: Income Taxes\nThe components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows:\nSignificant components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes attributable to income before income taxes were as follows:\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 68\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Significant components of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nThe change in the gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2020 and 2019 is primarily due to increases in outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries, tax credits, operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and decreases in prepaid cost sharing.\nThe Company previously made an accounting policy election to record deferred taxes related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d).\nRealization of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets is based upon the weighting of available evidence, including such factors as the recent earnings history and expected future taxable income. The Company believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of $245.0 million related to California deferred tax assets. At June 28, 2020, the Company continued to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in California.\nAt June 28, 2020, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $29.1 million. If not utilized, these losses will begin to expire in fiscal year 2021, and are subject to limitation on their utilization.\nAt June 28, 2020, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $91.4 million. If not utilized, these losses will begin to expire in fiscal year 2021 and are subject to limitation on their utilization.\nAt June 28, 2020, the Company had state tax credit carryforwards of $360.0 million. Substantially all of these credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 69\nA reconciliation of income tax expense provided at the federal statutory rate (21% in fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019, and 28.27% in fiscal year 2018) to actual income tax expense is as follows:\nIn November 2019, the Ninth Circuit rejected the en banc appeal petitioned by Altera in July 2019. In that quarter, the Company evaluated the impact of the decision and viewed the denial as an indication that Altera\u2019s position of excluding stock-based compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing arrangement was unlikely to be sustained upon further litigation. As a result, the Company reversed $74.5 million of net tax assets associated with stock-based compensation benefits related to previous years in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 29, 2019 and the Company no longer reflected a net tax benefit within its financial statements related to excluding stock-based compensation from its inter-company cost-sharing arrangement. In February 2020, Altera petitioned the SCOTUS to hear their case. In June 2020, the SCOTUS denied the petition.\nEarnings of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries included in consolidated retained earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations aggregated to approximately $539.3 million at June 28, 2020. If these earnings were remitted to the United States, they would be subject to foreign withholding taxes of approximately $86.4 million at current statutory rates.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 70\nAs of June 28, 2020, the total gross uncertain tax positions were $476.7 million, compared to $420.8 million as of June 30, 2019, and $305.4 million as of June 24, 2018. During fiscal year 2020, gross uncertain tax positions increased by $55.9 million. The amount of uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $423.8 million, $376.0 million, and $268.3 million, as of June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019, and June 24, 2018, respectively. The aggregate changes in the balance of gross uncertain tax positions were as follows:\nThe Company recognizes interest expense and penalties related to the above uncertain tax positions within income tax expense. The Company had accrued $40.2 million, $19.1 million, and $13.0 million cumulatively for gross interest and penalties as of June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019, and June 24, 2018, respectively.\nThe Company is subject to audits by state and foreign tax authorities. The Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlements, if any, with the relevant taxing authorities will occur.\nThe Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign income tax returns. As of June 28, 2020, tax years 2004-2020 remain subject to examination in the jurisdictions where the Company operates. The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) is examining the Company\u2019s U.S. federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2018. As of June 28, 2020, no significant adjustments have been proposed by the IRS. The Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlements, if any, with the IRS will occur.\nThe Company is in various stages of examinations in connection with all of its tax audits worldwide, and it is difficult to determine when these examinations will be settled. It is reasonably possible that over the next 12-month period the Company may experience an increase or decrease in its uncertain tax positions as a result of tax examinations or lapses of statute of limitations. The change in uncertain tax positions as a result of lapses of statute of limitations may range up to $17.5 million.\nNote 8: Net Income per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the treasury stock method, for dilutive stock options, restricted stock units, and convertible notes.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 71\nThe following table reconciles the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted computations for net income per share.\n(1)\nDiluted shares outstanding do not include any effect resulting from note hedges associated with the Company\u2019s 2018 Notes as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.\nFor purposes of computing diluted net income per share, weighted-average common shares do not include potentially dilutive securities that are anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. The following potentially dilutive securities were excluded:\nNote 9: Financial Instruments\nFair Value\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nA fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The level of an asset or liability in the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.\nLevel 2: Valuations based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or model-derived valuations techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 72\nLevel 3: Valuations based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities and based on non-binding, broker-provided price quotes and may not have been corroborated by observable market data.\nThe Company\u2019s primary financial instruments include its cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash and investments, long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt and leases, and foreign currency related derivative instruments. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates their carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. The estimated fair values of lease obligations approximate their carrying value as the substantial majority of these obligations have interest rates that adjust to market rates on a periodic basis. Refer to Note 14 - Long Term Debt and Other Borrowings for additional information regarding the fair value of the Company\u2019s senior notes and convertible senior notes.\nInvestments\nThe following table sets forth the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash and investments, and other assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019:\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 73\nThe Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Realized gains (losses) for investment sales are specifically identified. Management assesses the fair value of investments in debt securities that are not actively traded through consideration of interest rates and their impact on the present value of the cash flows to be received from the investments. The Company also considers whether changes in the credit ratings of the issuer could impact the assessment of fair value. Additionally, the Company considers factors such as the Company\u2019s intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.\nDuring the fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a $42.5 million other-than-temporary impairment charge on a portion of its available for sale investments as a result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in conjunction with our cash repatriation strategy following the U.S. tax reform legislation. The Company did not recognize any losses on investments due to other-than-temporary impairments in fiscal year 2020 or 2019. Gross realized gains/(losses) from sales of investments were insignificant in the fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 74\nThe following is an analysis of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments in unrealized loss positions:\nThe amortized cost and fair value of cash equivalents, investments, and restricted investments with contractual maturities as of June 28, 2020, are as follows:\nThe Company has the ability, if necessary, to liquidate its investments in order to meet the Company\u2019s liquidity needs in the next 12 months. Accordingly, those investments with contractual maturities greater than 12 months from the date of purchase nonetheless are classified as short-term on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company carries derivative financial instruments (\u201cderivatives\u201d) on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options with financial institutions with the primary objective of reducing volatility of earnings and cash flows related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swap arrangements to manage interest rate risk. The counterparties to these derivatives are large, global financial institutions that the Company believes are creditworthy, and therefore, it does not consider the risk of counterparty nonperformance to be material.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company\u2019s financial position is routinely subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar transactions or cash flows, primarily from Japanese yen-denominated revenues and euro-denominated and Korean won-denominated expenses. The Company\u2019s policy is to mitigate the foreign exchange risk arising from the fluctuations in the value of these non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions or cash flows through a foreign currency cash flow hedging program, using forward contracts and foreign currency options that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. These hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on the Company\u2019s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts\u2019 gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in revenue/expense in the same period the hedged items are recognized.\nIn addition, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in certain benchmark interest rates on fixed rate debt. These instruments are designated\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 75\nas cash flow hedges at inception and are settled in conjunction with the issuance of debt. The effective portion of the contracts\u2019 gains or losses is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized into income as the hedged item impacts earnings. During the year ended June 28, 2020, the Company entered into and settled a series of these interest rate swap arrangements with a notional value of $400 million. During the year ended June 28, 2020, the company recognized a net loss of $31.5 million of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to these interest rate swap agreements. As of June 28, 2020, $31.1 million of losses related to these interest rate swap arrangements remain in accumulated other comprehensive income, which it expects to reclassify from other comprehensive income into earnings over the next 10.0 years.\nAt inception and at each quarter-end, hedges are tested prospectively and retrospectively for effectiveness using regression analysis. Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts due to changes in time value are included in the assessment of effectiveness. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship must meet criteria relating to both the derivative instrument and the hedged item. These criteria include identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instrument\u2019s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item\u2019s fair value or cash flows will be measured. There were no material gains or losses during the fiscal years ended June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019, or June 24, 2018 associated with forecasted transactions that failed to occur. There were no material gains or losses during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, or June 24, 2018 associated with ineffectiveness.\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be tested to demonstrate an expectation of providing highly effective offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges, the Company recognizes effective changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged exposure is realized. Consequently, the Company\u2019s results of operations are not subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments. If hedges are not highly effective or if the Company does not believe that the underlying hedged forecasted transactions will occur, the Company may not be able to account for its derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. If this were to occur, future changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative instruments would be recognized in earnings. Additionally, related amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income would be reclassified to income immediately. As of June 28, 2020, the Company had a net gain of $0.3 million accumulated in other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to foreign exchange cash flow hedges which it expects to reclassify from other comprehensive income into earnings over the next 12 months. Additionally, as of June 28, 2020, the Company had a net loss of $2.0 million accumulated in other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to interest rate contracts which it expects to reclassify from other comprehensive income into earnings over the next 4.7 years.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company had interest rate contracts whereby the Company received fixed rates and paid variable rates based on certain benchmark interest rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to interest expense, a component of other expense, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. These interest rate contracts were designated as fair value hedges and hedged against changes in the fair value of our debt portfolio. The Company concluded that these interest rate contracts met the criteria necessary to qualify for the short-cut method of hedge accounting, and as such, an assumption was made that the change in the fair value of the hedged debt, due to changes in the benchmark rate, exactly offset the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap. Therefore, the derivative was considered to be effective at achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged liability, and no ineffectiveness was recognized. During the year ended June 28, 2020, the Company terminated and consequently discontinued the hedging relationship of these interest rate contracts, refer to Note 14 - Long-Term Debt and Other borrowings for additional information regarding the accumulated fair value adjustment and the related amortization.\nBalance Sheet Hedges\nThe Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge fluctuations associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. These forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a component of other income (expense) and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, which are also recorded in other income (expense).\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 76\nAs of June 28, 2020, the Company had the following outstanding foreign currency contracts that were entered into under its cash flow and balance sheet hedge programs:\nThe fair value of derivative instruments in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019, were as follows:\nUnder the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, subject to applicable requirements, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions of the same currency with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. However, the Company has elected to present the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis on its balance sheet. As of June 28, 2020, the potential effect of rights of offset associated with the above foreign exchange and interest rate contracts would be\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 77\nan offset to assets and liabilities by $0.9 million, resulting in a net derivative asset of $1.1 million and net derivative liability of $0.6 million. As of June 30, 2019, the potential effect of rights of offset associated with the above foreign exchange contracts would be an offset to both assets and liabilities by $2.4 million, resulting in a net derivative asset of $0.5 million and a net derivative liability of $6.2 million. The Company is not required to pledge, nor is the Company entitled to receive, cash collateral for these derivative transactions.\nThe effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations, including accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d), was as follows:\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations was as follows:\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 78\nThe following table presents the effect of the fair value cash flow hedge accounting on the Statement of Financial Performance as well as presents the location and amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Income on fair value and cash flow hedging relationships:\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash and investments, trade accounts receivable, and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. Cash is placed on deposit at large, global financial institutions. Such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company\u2019s cash are creditworthy and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these balances.\nThe Company\u2019s overall portfolio of available-for-sale securities must maintain an average minimum rating of \u201cAA-\u201d or \u201cAa3\u201d as rated by Standard and Poor\u2019s, Fitch Ratings, or Moody\u2019s Investor Services. To ensure diversification and minimize concentration, the Company\u2019s policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts that are used to mitigate the effect of exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and on contracts related to structured share repurchase arrangements. These counterparties are large, global financial institutions and, to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.\nCredit risk evaluations, including trade references, bank references, and Dun & Bradstreet ratings, are performed on all new customers, and the Company monitors its customers\u2019 financial condition and payment performance. In general, the Company does not require collateral on sales.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 79\nAs of June 28, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 21% and 12%, of accounts receivable, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, four customers accounted for approximately 18%, 15%, 11%, and 10% of accounts receivable, respectively. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company\u2019s balance and transactional activity for its allowance for doubtful accounts is not material as of and for the twelve months ended June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019, and June 24, 2018.\nNote 10: Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. System shipments to customers in Japan, for which title does not transfer until customer acceptance, are classified as finished goods inventory and carried at cost until title transfers. Inventories consist of the following:\nNote 11: Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net, is presented in the table below. In connection with the adoption of ASC 842, the Company has excluded $18.4 million of finance right-of-use assets recorded within property and equipment, net from the table below. See Note 15 - Leases for additional information regarding these finance lease right-of-use assets.\nDepreciation expense, excluding amortization of finance lease right of use assets during fiscal year 2020 was $198.8 million. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, depreciation expense, including amortization of capital leases, was $182.1 million, and $165.2 million, respectively.\nNote 12: Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe balance of goodwill was $1.5 billion as of June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. As of June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $61.1 million of the goodwill balance is tax deductible, and the remaining balance is not tax deductible due to purchase accounting and applicable foreign law. No goodwill impairments were recognized in fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 80\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table provides details of the Company\u2019s intangible assets, other than goodwill:\nThe Company recognized $66.2 million, $127.3 million, and $161.2 million in intangible asset amortization expense during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. No intangible asset impairments were recognized in fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nThe estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets as of June 28, 2020, is reflected in the table below. The table excludes $12.3 million of capitalized costs for intangible assets that have not yet been placed into service.\nNote 13: Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following:\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 81\nNote 14: Long Term Debt and Other Borrowings\nAs of June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019, the Company\u2019s outstanding debt consisted of the following:\n(1)\nAs of the report date, these notes were convertible at the option of the bondholder. This is a result of the following condition being met: the market value of the Company\u2019s Common Stock was greater than 130% of the convertible notes conversion price for 20 or more of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-end. As a result, the 2041 Notes were classified in current liabilities and a portion of the equity component associated with the convertible notes, representing the unamortized discount, was classified in temporary equity on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon closure of the conversion period, the notes not converted will be reclassified back into noncurrent liabilities and the temporary equity will be reclassified into permanent equity.\n(2)\nThis amount represents a cumulative fair market gain for discontinued hedging relationships, net of an immaterial amount of amortization for the year ended June 28, 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s contractual cash obligations relating to its outstanding debt as of June 28, 2020, were as follows:\n(1)\nAs noted above, the conversion period for the 2041 Notes is open as of June 28, 2020. As there is the potential for conversion at the option of the holder, the principal balance of the 2041 Notes has been included in the one-year payment period.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn June 2012, with the acquisition of Novellus, the Company assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2041 (the \u201c2041 Notes\u201d). The Company pays cash interest at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2041 Notes also have a contingent interest payment provision that may require the Company to pay additional interest, up to 0.60% per year, based on certain thresholds, beginning with the semi-annual interest payment on May 15, 2021, and upon the occurrence of certain events, as outlined in the indenture governing the 2041 Notes.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 82\nThe Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of the 2041 Notes. The initial debt components of the 2041 Notes were valued based on the present value of the future cash flows using the Company\u2019s borrowing rate at the date of the issuance or assumption for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature, which equals the effective interest rate on the liability component disclosed in the table below, respectively. The equity component was initially valued equal to the principle value of the notes, less the present value of the future cash flows using the Company\u2019s borrowing rate at the date of the issuance or assumption for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature, which equated to the initial debt discount.\nThe 2041 Notes may be redeemed by the Company on or after May 21, 2021 at a price equal to outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest if the last reported sales price of common shares has been equal to or more than 150% of the then applicable conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the redemption notice date.\nUnder certain circumstances, the 2041 Notes may be converted into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. The number of shares each debenture is convertible into is based on conversion rates, disclosed in the table below. The principal value of the 2041 Note conversions in the fiscal year ended June 28, 2020, was $163.9 million. During the quarter ended June 28, 2020 and in the subsequent period through August 18, 2020, the Company received notice of conversion for an additional $18.1 million principal value of 2041 Notes, which will settle in the quarter ending September 27, 2020. As a result of the cumulative conversions, as of June 28, 2020, $48.5 million of the 2041 notes remain outstanding.\nSelected additional information regarding the 2041 Notes outstanding as of June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019, is as follows:\nSenior Notes\nOn May 5, 2020, the company completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes due June 15, 2030 (the \u201c2030 Notes\u201d), $750 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes due June 15, 2050 (the \u201c2050 Notes\u201d), and $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes due June 15, 2060 (the \u201c2060 Notes\u201d).

The facility matures on October 13, 2022.\nInterest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at the Company\u2019s option, based on (1) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5%, or (2) LIBOR multiplied by the statutory rate, plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of the Company\u2019s non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, the Company will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on the Company\u2019s credit rating. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default. As of June 28, 2020, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and was in compliance with all financial covenants.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOn November 13, 2017, the Company established a commercial paper program under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion. The net proceeds from the CP Program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Company\u2019s Common Stock from time to time under the Company\u2019s stock repurchase program. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is backstopped by the Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Arrangement. As of June 28, 2020, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the CP Program.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 84\nInterest Cost\nThe following table presents the amount of interest cost recognized relating to both the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the debt discount, issuance costs, and effective portion of interest rate contracts with respect to the Senior Notes, convertible notes, commercial paper, and the revolving credit facility during the fiscal years ended June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019, and June 24, 2018.\nNote 15: Leases\nThe Company leases certain office spaces, manufacturing and warehouse spaces, equipment, and vehicles. On July 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASC 842. Refer to Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements for additional information regarding the adoption. While the majority of the Company\u2019s lease arrangements are operating leases, the Company has certain leases that qualify as finance leases.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows for the year ended June 28, 2020 (in thousands):\nVariable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the right of use asset and lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments primarily include costs associated with the Company\u2019s third party logistics arrangements that contain one or more embedded leases. Variable lease costs will fluctuate based on factory output and material receipt volumes. Short-term rental expense, for agreements less than one year in duration, were immaterial for the twelve months ended June 28, 2020.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows as of June 28, 2020 (in thousands):\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 85\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases were as follows as of June 28, 2020 (in thousands):\nAs of June 28, 2020, the maturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 86\nSelected Operating Leases and Related Guarantees\nThe Company leases the majority of its administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices, and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of the Company\u2019s facility leases for buildings located at its Fremont, California headquarters; Tualatin, Oregon campus; and certain other facility leases provide the Company with options to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of the Company\u2019s facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. The Company\u2019s rental expense for facilities occupied during fiscal years 2019, and 2018 was $28.1 million, and $23.5 million, respectively.\nThe Company has operating leases regarding certain improved properties in Fremont and Livermore, California (the \u201cCalifornia Operating Leases\u201d). The Company is required to maintain cash collateral in an aggregate of approximately $250 million in separate interest-bearing accounts as security for the Company\u2019s obligations. These amounts are recorded with other restricted cash and investments in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 28, 2020.\nDuring the term of the California Operating Leases and when the terms of the California Operating Leases expire, the property subject to those Operating Leases may be re-marketed. The Company has guaranteed to the lessor that each property will have a certain minimum residual value. The aggregate guarantee made by the Company under the California Operating Leases is generally no more than $220.4 million; however, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to the California Operating Lease may be 100% of the lessor\u2019s aggregate investment in the applicable property, which in no case will exceed $250.0 million, in the aggregate.\nNote 16: Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans\nEmployee Savings and Retirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement savings plan for its eligible employees in the United States. Each participant in the plan may elect to contribute from 1% to 75% of annual eligible earnings to the plan, subject to statutory limitations. The Company makes matching employee contributions in cash to the plan at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of earnings contributed. Employees participating in the 401(k) retirement savings plan are fully vested in the Company matching contributions, and investments are directed by participants. The Company made matching contributions of $23.6 million, $24.1 million, and $21.4 million, in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Arrangements\nThe Company has an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan whereby certain executives may defer a portion of their compensation. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based on their allocation of their account balance among various mutual funds. The Company controls the investment of these funds, and the participants remain general creditors of the Company. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits on a specified date at least three years after the opening of a deferral sub-account or upon retirement. Distributions are made in the form of lump sum or annual installments over a period of up to 20 years as elected by the participant. If no alternate election has been made, a lump sum payment will be made upon termination of a participant\u2019s employment with the Company. As of June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019, the liability of the Company to the plan participants was $220.0 million and $207.0 million, respectively, which was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019, the Company had investments in the aggregate amount of $235.1 million and $228.9 million, respectively, which correlate to the deferred compensation obligations, which were recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPost-Retirement Healthcare Plan\nThe Company maintains a post-retirement healthcare plan for certain executive and director retirees. Coverage continues through the duration of the lifetime of the retiree or the retiree\u2019s spouse, whichever is longer. The benefit obligation was $41.0 million and $40.5 million as of June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019, respectively.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 87\nNote 17: Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company has certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts; some of these are recorded on its balance sheet and some are not. Obligations that are recorded on the Company\u2019s balance sheet include the Company\u2019s operating and finance lease obligations. Obligations that are not recorded on the Company\u2019s balance sheet include contractual relationships for purchase obligations and certain guarantees. The Company\u2019s commitments relating to off-balance sheet agreements are included in the tables below. These amounts exclude $439.5 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions because the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 7 - Income Taxes for further discussion.\nOther Guarantees\nThe Company has issued certain indemnifications to its lessors for taxes and general liability under some of its agreements. The Company has entered into insurance contracts that are intended to limit its exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 28, 2020, the Company had not recorded any liability on its Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as it does not believe that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees.\nGenerally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, its customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by the Company\u2019s products or services. The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. The Company does not believe that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees.\nThe Company provides guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 28, 2020, the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $58.6 million. The Company does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid.\nIn addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, consistent with its Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation; and under local law, the Company may be required to provide indemnification to its employees for actions within the scope of their employment. Although the Company maintains insurance contracts that cover some of the potential liability associated with these indemnification agreements, there is no guarantee that all such liabilities will be covered. The Company does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under such indemnification agreements or statutory obligations.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations consist of non-cancelable significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented below contains the Company\u2019s minimum obligations at June 28, 2020, under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the following table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 88\nThe Company\u2019s commitments related to these agreements as of June 28, 2020, were as follows:\nWarranties\nThe Company provides standard warranties on its systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. As of June 28, 2020, warranty reserves totaling $11.4 million were recognized in other long-term liabilities, the remainder were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s product warranty reserves were as follows:\nLegal Proceedings\nWhile the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings that it believes material, the Company is either a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that have arisen from time to time in the normal course of business, including intellectual property claims. The Company accrues for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Based on current information, the Company does not believe that a material loss from known matters is probable and therefore has not recorded an accrual of any material amount for litigation or other contingencies related to existing legal proceedings.\nNote 18: Stock Repurchase Program\nIn November 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of Common Stock. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Funding for this repurchase program may be through a combination of cash on hand, cash generation, and borrowings. As of June 28, 2020, the Company has purchased approximately $3.2 billion of shares under this authorization, $0.7 billion via open market trading and $2.5 billion utilizing accelerated share repurchase arrangements.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 89\nRepurchases under the repurchase program were as follows during the periods indicated:\n(1)\nAverage price paid per share excludes effect of accelerated share repurchases; see additional disclosure below regarding the Company\u2019s accelerated share repurchase activity during the fiscal year.\n(2)\nIncludes shares received at final settlement of accelerated share repurchase agreements; see additional disclosures below regarding the Company\u2019s accelerated share repurchase activity during the fiscal year.\nIn addition to the shares repurchased under the Board-authorized repurchase program shown above, the Company acquired 380 thousand shares at a total cost of $109.6 million during the 12 months ended June 28, 2020, which the Company withheld through net settlements to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company\u2019s equity compensation plans. The shares retained by the Company through these net share settlements are not a part of the Board-authorized repurchase program but instead are authorized under the Company\u2019s equity compensation plan.\nAccelerated Share Repurchase Agreements\nOn November 22, 2019, the Company entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the \"November 2019 ASR\") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $1.0 billion of Common Stock. The Company took an initial delivery of approximately 2.9 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by the Company\u2019s closing stock price on November 22, 2019. The total number of shares received under the November 2019 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the November 2019 ASR occurred during March 2020, resulting in the receipt of approximately 705 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $280.27 for the transaction period.\nOn June 4, 2019, the Company entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the \"June 2019 ASR\") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $750 million of Common Stock. The Company took an initial delivery of approximately 3.1 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by the Company\u2019s closing stock price on June 4, 2019. The total number of shares received under the June 2019 ASR will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the agreements occurred during November 2019, resulting in the receipt of approximately 361 thousand additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $215.60 for the transaction period.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 90\nNote 19: Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax at the end of June 28, 2020, as well as the activity during the fiscal year ended June 28, 2020, were as follows:\n(1)\nAmount of after-tax gain reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into net income located in other expense, net.\n(2)\nAmount of after-tax gain reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into net income located in revenue: $2.1 million gain; cost of goods sold: $2.6 million loss; selling, general, and administrative expenses: $1.1 million loss; and other income and expense: $0.5 million loss.\nTax related to other comprehensive income, and the components thereto, for the years ended June 28, 2020, June 30, 2019, and June 24, 2018 was not material.\nNote 20: Segment, Geographic Information, and Major Customers\nThe Company operates in one reportable business segment: manufacturing and servicing of wafer processing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Company\u2019s material operating segments qualify for aggregation due to their customer base and similarities in economic characteristics, nature of products and services, and processes for procurement, manufacturing, and distribution.\nThe Company operates in seven geographic regions: United States, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. For geographical reporting, revenue is attributed to the geographic location in which the customers\u2019 facilities are located, while long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic locations in which the assets are located.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 91\nRevenues and long-lived assets by geographic region were as follows:\nIn fiscal year 2020, four customers accounted for approximately 24%, 14%, 10%, and 10% of total revenues, respectively. In fiscal year 2019, four customers accounted for approximately 15%, 14%, 14%, and 14% of total revenues, respectively. In fiscal year 2018, five customers accounted for approximately 25%, 14%, 14%, 13%, and 12% of total revenues, respectively. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of total revenues.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 92\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Lam Research Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201c) as of June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\u2018 equity, for each of the three years in the period ended June 28, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201c). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 28, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 18, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard\nAs discussed in Note 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers in the year ended June 30, 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2018s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2018s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosure to which it relates.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 93\nInventory - Valuation\nDescription of the Matter\nThe Company\u2019s inventories totaled $1.9 billion as of June 28, 2020, representing 13% of total assets. As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company assesses the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management\u2019s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost.\nAuditing management\u2019s estimates for excess and obsolete inventory involved subjective auditor judgment because management\u2019s assessment of whether a write down is required and the measurement of any excess of cost over net realizable value is judgmental and considers a number of qualitative factors that are affected by market and economic conditions outside the Company\u2019s control.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe evaluated and tested the Company\u2019s processes and the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls addressing the identified audit risks. This included controls over management\u2019s assessment of inventory valuation, including the development of forecasted usage of inventories and consideration of how factors outside of the Company\u2019s control might affect management\u2019s judgment related to the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions (e.g., forecasts related to the Company\u2019s future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, and possible alternative uses) and the underlying data used in management\u2019s excess and obsolete inventory valuation assessment. We evaluated inventory levels compared to forecasted demand, historical sales and specific product considerations. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management\u2019s estimates.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1981.\nSan Jose, California\nAugust 18, 2020\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 94\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Lam Research Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Lam Research Corporation\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Lam Research Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\u2018 equity, for each of the three years in the period ended June 28, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated August 18, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nAugust 18, 2020\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 95",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDesign of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over final reporting that are designed to comply with Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control. Moreover, we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100% effective all of the time. Accordingly, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), as of June 28, 2020, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of June 28, 2020, at the reasonable assurance level.\nWe intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover. Our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic a significant number of our employees are working remotely. The design of our business processes and internal controls enabled remote execution through secure remote access to data. While certain of our business processes required slight modification as a result of the need for remote work, those changes did not result in the need for significant adjustments to our internal control structure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate \u201cinternal control over financial reporting\u201d, as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Controls - Integrated Framework used by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 28, 2020, at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the financial statements included in this 2020 Form 10-K and has issued an attestation report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K.\nEffectiveness of Controls\nWhile we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level, future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting.\nContinues on next page\nLam Research Corporation 2020 10-K 96",
