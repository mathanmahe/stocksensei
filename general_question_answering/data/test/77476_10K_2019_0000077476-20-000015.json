    "item_1": "Item 1. Business.\nWhen used in this report, the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cPepsiCo\u201d and the \u201cCompany\u201d mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. Certain terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined in the Glossary included in Item 7. of this report.\nCompany Overview\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986. We are a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.\nOur Operations\nChanges to Organizational Structure\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned our Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) and Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA) reportable segments to be consistent with a recent strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. As a result, our beverage, food and snack businesses in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia that were part of our former AMENA segment and our businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa that were part of our former ESSA segment are now reported together as our Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA) segment. The remaining beverage, food and snack businesses that were part of our former AMENA segment are now reported together as our Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC) segment and our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe are now reported as our Europe segment.\nThese changes did not impact our Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), Quaker Foods North America (QFNA),\nPepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), formerly named North America Beverages, or Latin America (LatAm) reportable segments or our consolidated financial results.\nOur historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure.\nWe are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:\n1)\nFLNA, which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada;\n2)\nQFNA, which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada;\n3)\nPBNA, which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;\n4)\nLatAm, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America;\n5)\nEurope, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe;\n6)\nAMESA, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and\n7)\nAPAC, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.\nFrito-Lay North America\nEither independently or in conjunction with third parties, FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells branded snack foods.

Further, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp. (Tingyi).\nOur Distribution Network\nOur products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.\nDirect-Store-Delivery\nWe, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.\nCustomer Warehouse\nSome of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover.\nDistributor Networks\nWe distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.\nE-commerce\nOur products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.\nIngredients and Other Supplies\nThe principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners\u2019 facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.\nOur Brands and Intellectual Property Rights\nWe own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including 1893, Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Arto Lifewater, Aunt Jemima, Bare, Bolt24, bubly, Cap\u2019n Crunch, Cheetos, Chester\u2019s, Chipita, Chipsy, Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Domik v Derevne, Doritos, Duyvis, Elma Chips, Emperador, Evolve, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, G2, Gamesa, Gatorade, Grandma\u2019s, H2oh!, Health Warrior, Imunele, Izze, J-7 Tonus, Kas, KeVita, Kurkure, Lay\u2019s, Life, Lifewtr, Lubimy, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickie\u2019s, Mother\u2019s, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Amp Game Fuel, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mountain Dew Ice, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, Mug, Munchies, Muscle Milk, Naked, Near East, Off the Eaten Path, O.N.E., Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pepsi, Pepsi Black, Pepsi Max, Pepsi Zero Sugar, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Rice-A-Roni, Rold Gold, Rosquinhas Mabel, Ruffles, Sabritas, Sakata, Saladitas, San Carlos, Sandora, Santitas, 7UP (outside the United States), 7UP Free (outside the United States), Sierra Mist, Sierra Mist Zero Sugar, Simba, Smartfood, Smith\u2019s, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SodaStream, Sonric\u2019s, Stacy\u2019s, Sting, Stubborn Soda, SunChips, Toddy, Toddynho, Tostitos, Trop 50, Tropicana, Tropicana Pure Premium, Tropicana Twister, V Water, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers and Ya. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Dole and Ocean Spray. We also distribute Rockstar Energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.\nWe either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others.\nSeasonality\nOur businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage, food and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.\nOur Customers\nOur customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and other\npromotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the rapid growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the growth in hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2019, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sam\u2019s Club (Sam\u2019s), represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions. Our top five retail customers represented approximately 34% of our 2019 net revenue in North America, with Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam\u2019s) representing approximately 19%. These percentages include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.\nSee \u201cOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\u201d in \u201cOur Financial Results - Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our independent bottlers.\nOur Competition\nOur beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondel\u0113z International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestl\u00e9 S.A. and Red Bull GmbH.\nMany of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2019, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 20%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.\nOur beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting changing consumer demands and preferences and accelerating sustainable growth. These activities principally involve: development of new ingredients, flavors and products; reformulation and improvement in the quality and appeal of existing products; improvement and modernization of manufacturing processes, including cost reduction; improvements in product quality, safety and integrity; development of, and improvements in, marketing and merchandising equipment, dispensing equipment, packaging technology (including investments in recycling-focused technologies), package design (including development of sustainable, bio-based packaging) and portion sizes; efforts focused on identifying opportunities to transform, grow and broaden our product portfolio, including by developing products with improved nutrition profiles that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat, including through the use of natural flavors, sweetener alternatives and flavor modifiers and innovation in existing sweeteners and flavoring, further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio, including further growing our SodaStream business, and offering more products with positive nutrition including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy, protein and hydration; investments in building our capabilities to support our global e-commerce business; investments in technology and digitalization, including data analytics to enhance our consumer insights; and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment, including improvements in energy efficiency, water use in our operations and our agricultural practices. Our research centers are located around the world, including Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage nutrition science, food science, engineering and consumer insights to meet our strategy to continue to innovate in nutritious and convenient beverages, foods and snacks.\nIn 2019, we continued to make investments to further digitalize our business including: continuing to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce; and leveraging technology and data analytics to capture and analyze consumer level data to increasingly structure personalized communications with consumers and satisfy demand at the store level. In addition, we continued to refine our beverage, food and snack portfolio to meet changing consumer demands by reducing added sugars in many of our beverages and sodium and saturated fat in many of our foods and snacks, and by developing a broader portfolio of product choices, including: continuing to expand our beverage options that contain no high-fructose corn syrup and that are made with natural flavors; expanding our beyond the bottle offerings by offering bubly in fountain dispensing; developing 100% recycled PET packaging for LIFEWTR and aluminum can packaging for Aquafina; expanding our state of the art food and beverage healthy vending initiative to increase the availability of nutritious and convenient beverages, foods and snacks; further expanding our portfolio, through a combination of brand extensions, product reformulations, new product innovations and acquisitions to offer products with more of the nutritious ingredients and hydration our consumers are looking for, such as Quaker (grains), Tropicana (juices, lemonades, fruit and vegetable drinks), Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes), Naked Juice (cold-pressed juices and smoothies), KeVita (probiotics, tonics and fermented teas), Bare (baked apple chips and other baked fruits and vegetables), Health Warrior (nutrition bars), Evolve (plant-based protein products) and Muscle Milk (protein shakes); further expanding our whole grain products globally; and further expanding our portfolio in growing categories, such as dairy, hummus and other refrigerated dips, and baked grain snacks. In addition, we continued to make investments to reduce our impact on the environment, including: efforts to conserve raw materials and energy, such as by working to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across our global businesses, by helping to protect and conserve global water supply especially in high-water-risk locations (including replenishing watersheds that source our operations in high-water-risk locations and promoting the efficient use of water in our agricultural supply chain), and by incorporating improvements in the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain into our operations; efforts to reduce waste generated by our operations and disposed of in landfills; efforts to increase energy efficiency, including the increased use of renewable energy and resources; efforts to support sustainable agriculture by expanding best practices with our growers and suppliers, including\nthrough the use of data and technology to optimize yields and efficiency and promote responsible use of pesticides; and efforts to create a circular future for packaging, including the increased use of recycled content and alternative packaging, support for increased packaging recovery and recycling rates globally, optimization of packaging technology and design to minimize the amount of plastic in our packaging and to make our packaging increasingly recoverable or recyclable with lower environmental impact, and our continued investments in developing compostable and biodegradable packaging.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.\nThe U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Privacy Act of 2018; customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.\nWe are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, international trade and tariffs, supply chain, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax\nrate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates or encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and other single-use plastics. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.\nWe are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities and our facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see also \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nEmployees\nAs of December 28, 2019, we and our consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 267,000 people worldwide, including approximately 116,000 people within the United States. In certain countries, our employment levels are subject to seasonal variations. We or our subsidiaries are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. We expect that we will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.\nAvailable Information\nWe are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends.\nFuture demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate, market or distribute our products effectively, and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive categories and markets. To generate revenues and profits, we rely on continued demand for our products and therefore must understand our customers and consumers and sell products that appeal to them in the sales channel in which they prefer to shop or browse for such products. In general, changes in consumption in our product categories or consumer demographics can result in reduced demand for our products. Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with: health and wellness (including products that have less added sugars, sodium and saturated fat); convenience (including responding to changes in in-home and on-the-go consumption patterns and methods of distribution of our products to customers and consumers, including through e-commerce and hard discounters); or the location of origin or source of ingredients and products (including the environmental impact related to production and packaging of our products).\nConsumer preferences continuously evolve, due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, including the aging of the general population and the emergence of the millennial and younger generations who have differing spending, consumption and purchasing habits; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile of products, including the presence of added sugar, sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products; growing demand for organic, locally or sustainably sourced ingredients, or consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the health effects of ingredients or\nsubstances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial flavors and colors, artificial sweeteners, aspartame, caffeine, furfuryl alcohol, high-fructose corn syrup, partially hydrolyzed oils, saturated fat, sodium, sugar, trans fats or other product ingredients, substances or attributes, including genetically engineered ingredients; taxes or other restrictions, including labeling requirements, imposed on our products; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and their environmental impact; changes in package or portion size; changes in social trends that impact travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles; the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of purchasing products; negative publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from regulatory actions, litigation against us or other companies in our industry or negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media, including social media, about us, our employees, our products or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; perception of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or our respective social media posts, business practices or other information disseminated by or regarding them or us; product boycotts; or a downturn in economic conditions. These factors have in the past and could in the future reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase certain of our products and any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes can lead to reduced demand for our products or erode our competitive and financial position, resulting in adverse effects on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nDemand for our products is also dependent in part on product quality, product and marketing innovation and production and distribution, including our ability to: maintain a robust pipeline of new products; improve the quality of existing products; extend our portfolio of products in growing markets and categories (through acquisitions and innovation, such as increasing non-carbonated beverage offerings and other alternatives to, or reformulations of, carbonated beverage offerings); respond to cultural differences and regional consumer preferences (whether through developing or acquiring new products that are responsive to such preferences); monitor and adjust our use of ingredients and packaging materials (including to respond to applicable regulations); develop sweetener alternatives and innovation; increase the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging; create more relevant and personalized experiences for consumers whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in an otherwise physical environment; improve the production and distribution of our products; enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights; respond to competitive product and pricing pressures and changes in distribution channels, including in the e-commerce channel; maintain our labeling certifications (e.g., non-GMO) from independent organizations and regulatory authorities for certain of our products; and implement effective advertising campaigns and marketing programs, including successfully adapting to a rapidly changing media environment through the use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing programs.\nAlthough we devote significant resources to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop, launch, maintain or distribute successful new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner (including correctly anticipating or effectively reacting to changes in consumer preferences) or to develop and effectively execute advertising and marketing campaigns that appeal to customers and consumers, including through the use of digital technology. Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products or effectively market or distribute our products can reduce demand for our products, result in inventory write-offs and erode our competitive and financial position and can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in laws and regulations relating to the use or disposal of plastics or other product packaging can increase our costs, reduce demand for our products or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our food and beverage products are sold in plastic or other packaging designed to be recoverable for recycling but not all packaging is recovered, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise. In addition, certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable, compostable or biodegradable. There is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic, including microplastics, and other packaging waste in the environment, particularly in the world\u2019s oceans and waterways. As a result, packaging waste that displays one or more of our brands has in the past and could continue to result in negative publicity (whether or not valid) or reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn response to these concerns, the United States and many other jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increase recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form from taxes or fees designed to incentivize behavior to restrictions or bans on certain products and materials. For example, 24 countries in the European Union (EU) have established extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies, which make manufacturers such as us responsible for the costs of recycling beverage and food packaging after consumers have used them. EPR policies are also being contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including certain states in the United States. In addition, 10 states in the United States as well as a growing number of European countries have a bottle deposit return system in effect, which requires a deposit charged to consumers to incentivize the return of the beverage container. Further, certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing other types of regulations or policies, including packaging taxes, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to the plastic bottle, minimum recycled content mandates, which would require packaging to include a certain percentage of post-consumer recycled material in a new package, and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and other single-use plastics. These laws and regulations, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products or result in negative publicity (whether or not valid), resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we continue to devote significant resources to increase the recyclability and sustainability of our packaging, the increased focus on reducing plastic waste has required and could continue to require us to increase capital expenditures, including requiring additional investments to minimize the amount of plastic across our packaging, including to increase the use of alternative packaging materials (e.g., glass and aluminum) in certain markets; increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging; and develop sustainable, bio-based packaging as a replacement for fossil fuel-based plastic packaging, including flexible film alternatives for our snacks packaging. Our failure to minimize our plastics use, increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging or develop sustainable packaging or consumers\u2019 failure to accept such sustainable packaging has in the past and could continue to reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products and erode our competitive and financial position. Further, our reputation can be damaged for failure to achieve our sustainability goals with respect to our plastics use, including our goal to reduce 35% of virgin plastic content across our beverage portfolio by 2025, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to packaging or disposal of our products.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outside the United States, including laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special\nimportance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. Many of these laws and regulations have differing or conflicting legal standards across the various markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold and, in certain markets, such as developing and emerging markets, may be less developed or certain. For example, products containing genetically engineered ingredients are subject to differing regulations and restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, as is the packaging, disposal and recyclability of our products. For example, the EU has mandated tethered caps for all beverage bottles by 2024 and minimum recycled content of 25% for PET bottles by 2025 and 30% for all plastic bottles by 2030 and laws mandating various minimum recycled content thresholds for PET bottles are also in place in Turkey, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, while the use of recycled content in food and beverage packaging is prohibited in a range of countries, for example, in Asia. In addition, these laws and regulations and related interpretations have changed and could continue to change, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes have included and could continue to include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and marketing practices, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed; laws and treaties related to international trade, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products; laws related to pesticide used by farmers in our supply chain or residual amounts of pesticide that may be found in certain of our ingredients or products; laws related to traceability requirements for our supply chain; laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products, including laws imposing restrictions on the use of government funds or programs to purchase certain of our products; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns (whether or not valid) regarding the effects on health of ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products, including without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer protection laws; laws regulating the protection of personal information; cyber-security regulations; regulatory initiatives, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other measures impacting the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products; accounting rules and interpretations; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating water rights and access to and use of water or utilities; environmental laws, including laws relating to the regulation of water treatment and discharge of wastewater and air emissions and laws relating to the disposal, recovery or recycling of our products and their packaging. Changes in regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, resulting in adverse effects on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe imposition of new laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes, labeling, product, production, recovery or recycling requirements, or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale or advertisement of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products, commodities used in the production of our products or use, disposal, recovery or recyclability of our products and their packaging, may further alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions often follow. For example, if one jurisdiction imposes a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages or foods, or imposes a specific labeling or warning requirement, other jurisdictions may impose similar or other measures that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products. The foregoing has in the past and could continue to result\nin decreased demand for certain of our products, adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of ingredients or substances in our products (whether or not valid).\nIn addition, studies (whether or not scientifically valid) have been and continue to be underway by third parties purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, caffeine, pesticides (e.g., glyphosate), furfuryl alcohol, added sugars, sodium, saturated fat and plastic. Third parties have also published documents or studies claiming (whether or not valid) that taxes can address consumer consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and foods high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. The results of these studies and documents have contributed to or resulted in and could continue to contribute to or result in an increase in consumer concerns (whether or not valid) about the health implications of consumption of certain of our products, an increase in the number of jurisdictions that impose taxes on our products, or an increase in new labeling, product or production requirements or other restrictions on the manufacturing, sale or display of our products, resulting in reduced demand for our products, our Company being subject to lawsuits or new regulations that can adversely affect sales of our products, and other adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, suppliers, or other third parties with whom we do business can take actions, intentional or not, that violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws or regulations or can fail to maintain required documentation sufficient to evidence our compliance with applicable laws or regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, any of which can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, certain regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall, seizure of products or assets or other sanctions, resulting in an adverse effect on the sales of products in our portfolio or damage to our reputation.\nIn addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as environmental remediation, product liability, toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs we have estimated. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our estimates or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the particular substance or ingredient levels. For example, Peru revised an existing threshold tax to become a graduated tax, effective June 2019, in which the per-ounce tax rate is tied to the amount of added sugar present in the beverage: the higher the amount of added sugar, the higher the per-\nounce tax rate, while Saudi Arabia expanded an existing flat tax rate of 50% on the retail price of carbonated soft drinks to include all sweetened beverages, including non-caloric beverages, effective December 2019. These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products, reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products could reduce demand for such products and can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products. For example, in California in the United States, Proposition 65 requires a specific warning on or relating to any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level established by the State of California.\nIn addition, a number of jurisdictions, both in and outside the United States, have imposed or are considering imposing labeling requirements, including color-coded labeling of certain food and beverage products where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations can suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nOur beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondel\u0113z International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestl\u00e9 S.A. and Red Bull GmbH.\nOur beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. If we are unable to effectively promote our existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective, if we fail to invest in and incorporate technology and digital tools across all areas of our business (including the use of data analytics to enhance our ability to effectively market to consumers), if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or\ncompete effectively (including in distributing our products effectively and cost efficiently through all existing and emerging channels of trade, including through e-commerce and hard discounters), we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity or reinvestment initiatives or operating model can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future success and earnings growth depend, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including implementing shared business service organizational models while reinvesting back into the business. Our productivity initiatives help support our growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations. We continue to implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack categories and markets. Some of these measures have yielded and could continue to yield unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced employee morale and productivity, and unexpected additional employee attrition, including the inability to attract or retain key personnel. It is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to lead and execute our plans, including to effectively manage personnel adjustments and transitions resulting from these initiatives and increased competition for employees with the skills necessary to implement our plans. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned, fail to implement these initiatives as timely as we anticipate, do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing these initiatives, fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the future, or fail to successfully manage business disruptions or unexpected employee consequences on our workforce, morale or productivity, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, in order to continue to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and operating model, it will be necessary to make certain investments in our business, which may be limited due to capital constraints. From time to time, we have in the past and could continue to implement these investment initiatives to enable us to compete more effectively, including investments to increase manufacturing capacity, improve innovation, transform our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and artificial intelligence, and enhance brand management through our use of data analytics to develop new commercial and consumer insights. If we fail to realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of these reinvestment initiatives, our business, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected as a result of political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold.\nPolitical conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or create uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations and government programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, climate change regulation, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit) is likely to lead to differing laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union and further global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. Any changes in, or the imposition of,\nnew laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations due to elections, referendums or other political conditions can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the Middle East, Brazil, China and India. However, there can be no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences as to distribution or otherwise. The following factors can reduce demand for our products or otherwise impede the growth of our business in developing and emerging markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest; increased competition; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets and the related impact on developed countries who export to these markets; volatile oil prices and the impact on the local economy in certain of these markets; our inability to acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to complete divestitures or refranchisings; imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other restrictions; our inability to hire or retain a highly skilled workforce; imposition of new or increased tariffs and other impositions on imported goods or sanctions against, or other regulations restricting contact with, certain countries in these markets, or imposition of new or increased sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations or tariffs on the products of such corporations operating in these markets; actions, such as removing our products from shelves, taken by retailers in response to U.S. trade sanctions, tariffs or other governmental action or policy; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; imposition of taxes on our products or the ingredients or substances used in our products; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, customers or other third parties; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; regulations relating to the repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; highly inflationary economies and potential highly inflationary economies, devaluation or fluctuation, such as the devaluation of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and the Mexican peso, or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses, such as occurred with respect to our Venezuelan businesses which were deconsolidated at the end of the third quarter of 2015; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. If we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected.\nUncertain or unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns. Our business or financial results have in the past and could continue to be adversely impacted by uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and globally, including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets, including speculative influences; highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the effects of government initiatives, including demonetization, austerity or stimulus measures to manage economic conditions and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold or of countries that may then impact countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; reduced demand for our products resulting from volatility in general global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional, local or private label products or other lower-cost products, or to less profitable sales channels; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our customers, consumers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and non-U.S. commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions, may be exposed to a ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, liquidity events, default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, changing regulatory requirements or other factors beyond our control. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, receivership, default or similar event involving a major financial institution, or changes in the regulatory environment, can limit the ability or willingness of financial institutions to enter into financial transactions with us, including to provide banking or related cash management services, or to extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all; can leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or exposed to certain currencies or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials, including through our use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures; or can result in a decline in the market value of our investments in debt securities, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similar risks exist with respect to our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors and joint venture partners and can result in their inability to obtain credit to purchase our products or to finance the manufacture and distribution of our products resulting in canceled orders and/or product delays, which can also have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business and reputation can suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to, cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise disrupted.\nWe depend on information systems and technology, some of which are provided by third parties, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including: to interface with our customers and consumers; to engage in marketing activities; to enable and improve the effectiveness of our operations; to order and manage materials from suppliers; to manage inventory; to manage and operate our facilities; to conduct research and development, including through the use of data analytics; to maintain accurate financial records; to achieve operational efficiencies; to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information; to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our customers,\nsuppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and other third parties; and to communicate with our investors.\nCyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being carried out by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored actors, criminal and terrorist organizations, individuals or groups participating in organized crime and insiders) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of computing resources, notoriety, financial fraud, operational disruption, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, such as impersonation and identity takeover attempts to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromises. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks, including many of the types of attacks described above. Although we incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, no cyberattack or other cyber incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date.\nIf we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and the skills and training of our employees, and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether as a result of natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, technology development defects, user errors, lapses in our controls or the malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of information they are entitled to access), or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or disruptive software, phishing, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business can be disrupted and, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors or financial loss; processing inefficiencies; the loss of, or failure to attract, new customers and consumers; lost revenues or other costs resulting from the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or the loss of a competitive advantage due to the unauthorized use, acquisition or disclosure of, or access to, confidential information; the incurrence of costs to restore data and to safeguard against future extortion attempts; the loss of, or damage to, intellectual property or trade secrets, including the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data or other assets; alteration, corruption or loss of accounting, financial or other data on which we rely for financial reporting and other purposes, which can cause errors or delays in our financial reporting; damage to our reputation or brands; damage to employee, customer and consumer relations; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions or fines; unauthorized disclosure of confidential personal information of our employees, customers or consumers; the loss of information and/or business operations disruption resulting from the failure of security patches to be developed and installed on a timely basis; violation of data privacy, security or other laws and regulations; and remediation costs.\nFurther, our information systems and those of our third-party providers, and the information stored therein can be compromised, including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods, resulting in unauthorized parties accessing or extracting sensitive data or confidential information. In the ordinary course of business, we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, primarily employees and former employees. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or\nconflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws, including with respect to data from residents of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and residents of the State of California covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, impose significant costs or challenges that are likely to increase over time. Failure to comply with existing or future data privacy laws and regulations can result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations.\nWe continue to devote significant resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhancing our internal controls, and other security measures, including training, to protect our systems and data. In addition, our risk management program also includes periodic review and discussion by our Board of Directors of analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats and our plans and strategies to address them. However, these security measures and processes cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every such breach or disruption. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of these security threats, the form and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nSimilar risks exist with respect to the cloud-based service providers and other third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-party vendors may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Moreover, our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies has heightened these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies are complex, unpredictable or beyond our control.\nWhile we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, energy and other supplies.\nWe and our business partners use various raw materials, energy and other supplies in our business. The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oats, oranges and other fruits, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including PET and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners\u2019 facilities and the vehicles delivering our products.\nSome of these raw materials and supplies are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions, and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers or that our contingency plans, including development of ingredients, materials or supplies to replace ingredients, materials or supplies sourced from such suppliers, will be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any ingredient that is sourced from such suppliers. In addition, increasing focus on climate\nchange, deforestation, the use of plastics and energy, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system is leading to increased activism focusing on consumer goods companies, governmental intervention and consumer response, and can adversely affect our or our suppliers\u2019 reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. The raw materials and energy, including fuel, that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters (such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding), disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, such as the recent coronavirus, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), limited or sole sources of supply, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. For example, concerns regarding trade relations between the United States and China escalated during fiscal 2019, with the United States imposing tariffs on the importation of certain Chinese goods and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. Higher duties on existing tariffs or additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we are not able to offset or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. Shortage of some of these raw materials and other supplies, sustained interruption in their supply or an increase in their costs can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. If commodity price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in raw materials and energy costs, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against commodity price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. In addition, certain of the derivatives used to hedge price risk do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, therefore, can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities.\nWater scarcity can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint venture partners and other third parties use water in the manufacturing of our products. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality, increasing focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributor, joint venture partners or other third parties; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including additional investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce water consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; failure to achieve our sustainability goals relating to water use; perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBusiness disruptions can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability, and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and customers, to make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their operations has occurred in the past and could continue to occur due to any of the following factors which can impair the ability to make, manufacture, transport, distribute or sell products in our portfolio: adverse weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change) or natural disasters, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding; government action; economic or political uncertainties or instability in countries in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, which may also affect our ability to protect the security of our assets and employees; fire; terrorism; outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; food safety warnings or recalls, whether related to products in our portfolio or otherwise; health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, such as the recent coronavirus; supply and commodity shortages; unplanned delays or unexpected problems associated with repairs or enhancements of facilities in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; cyber incidents, including the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities or those of our suppliers and other third parties who make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; telecommunications failures; power, fuel or water shortages; strikes, labor disputes or lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as truck drivers; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third parties. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, has in the past resulted and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore operations.\nProduct contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nProduct contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations (whether or not valid) of product quality issues, mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, allergens, adulteration or contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become unfit for consumption or cause injury, illness or death, or if appropriate resources are not devoted to product quality and safety (particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements, we can decide to, or be required to, recall products in our portfolio and/or we may be subject to liability or government action, which can result in payment of damages or fines, cause certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a period of time, result in destruction of product inventory, or result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid), which can reduce consumer demand and brand equity. Moreover, even if allegations of product contamination or tampering or suggestions that our products were not fit for consumption are meritless, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes can adversely affect our reputation or brands. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance, if we do not have enforceable indemnification from suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAny damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are a leading global beverage, food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world. Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past and could continue to be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental practices for all of our operations and activities, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws and workplace conditions and safety, or failure to require our suppliers or other third parties to do so; the failure to achieve our goals of reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products and of growing our portfolio of product choices; the failure to achieve our other sustainability goals, including with respect to plastic packaging, or to be perceived as appropriately addressing matters of social responsibility; the failure to protect our intellectual property, including in the event our brands are used without our authorization; health concerns (whether or not valid) about our products or particular ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale, display or advertising of our products; any failure to comply, or perception of a failure to comply, with our policies and goals, including those regarding advertising to children and reducing calorie consumption from sugar-sweetened beverages; our research and development efforts; the recall (voluntary or otherwise) of any products in our portfolio; our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, plastics or other packaging, water, energy use and waste management; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment, including the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging, or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to human rights throughout our value chain; the practices of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry) with respect to any of the foregoing, actual or perceived; consumer perception of our industry; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs; consumer perception of our use of social media; consumer perception of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry); or our responses or the responses of others in our industry to any of the foregoing.\nIn addition, we operate globally, which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations, including, without limitation, anti-corruption laws, competition laws and tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the event that we or our employees or agents engage in or are believed to have engaged in improper activities, we have in the past and could continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings, including enforcement actions, litigation, loss of sales or other consequences, resulting in damage to our reputation in the United States or abroad. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal control or to provide accurate and timely financial information can also hurt our reputation.\nFurther, the popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. As a result, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, policies, practices, advertising campaigns and marketing programs or sponsorship arrangements; our use of social media or of posts or other information disseminated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; consumer perception of any of the foregoing, or failure by us to respond effectively to any of the foregoing, has in the past and could continue to also generate adverse publicity (whether or not valid) that can damage our reputation.\nDamage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products or employees for any of these or other reasons has in the past and could continue to result in decreased demand for our products,\nresulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as requiring additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nFailure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. Issues associated with these activities have in the past and could continue to include, among other things: our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction; and diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations.\nWith respect to acquisitions, the following factors also have in the past and could continue to pose additional risk risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with the business of the acquired company, including integrating the acquired company\u2019s manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company; our ability to successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees (both of the acquired company and our company); conforming standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with other laws and regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures and avoiding increased operating expenses; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; retaining existing distributors; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation.\nWith respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsibility with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, resources or values as we do. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners have in the past and could continue to adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or otherwise damage our reputation and brands and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, acquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside of the United States, including fluctuations in exchange rates and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and laws and regulations outside the United States.\nWith respect to divestitures and refranchisings, we have in the past and could continue to be unable to complete or effectively manage such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all, resulting in failure to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestiture or refranchising. Further, as divestitures and refranchisings reduce our direct control over certain aspects of our business, any failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain can adversely impact our sales or business performance.\nAcquisitions or joint ventures that are not successfully completed, integrated into our existing operations or managed effectively, or divestitures or refranchisings that are not successfully completed or managed\neffectively or do not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA change in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses can result in an impairment charge that materially affects our results of operations.\nWe conduct impairment tests on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets annually, during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and have recorded impairments in the past. Any changes in our estimates or underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our reporting units or in determining the fair value of any such reporting unit, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets, can adversely affect our results of operations. Factors considered to determine if an impairment exist include, but are not limited to: significant negative economic or industry trends or competitive operating conditions; significant macroeconomic conditions that can result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value; and significant changes in the nature and timing of decisions regarding assets or markets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, including factors we use to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. While no material impairment charges have been recorded in the periods presented in this Form 10-K, we may in the future record impairment charges that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods recognized. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction can reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of our income. In addition, existing tax laws in the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have been and could in the future be subject to significant change. For example, in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) was signed into law in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may continue to impact our recorded amounts in future periods. In addition, on May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1, 2020. Certain provisions of the TRAF were enacted in fiscal year 2019, resulting in adjustments to our deferred taxes. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be estimated and we continue to monitor and assess the impact of TRAF on our business and financial results. For further information regarding the impact and potential impact of the TCJ Act and the TRAF, see \u201cOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cOur Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAdditional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. These changes have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business. In connection with the OECD\u2019s BEPS project, the OECD has undertaken a new project focused on \u201cAddressing the Tax Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy.\u201d This project may impact all multinational businesses by reallocating where some profits are taxed and implementing a global model for minimum taxation. The increasingly complex\nglobal tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. In connection with the OECD\u2019s BEPS project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it can have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit, hire, retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce. We compete to recruit and hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to hire and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Wal-Mart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruption in the retail landscape, including rapid growth in the e-commerce channel and hard discounters, can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services as well as the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers. We continue to make significant investments in attracting talent to and building our global e-commerce and digital capabilities. Although we are engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers or otherwise adapt to the growing e-commerce landscape, while simultaneously maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels, we may be disadvantaged in certain channels and with certain customers and consumers, which can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the growth in e-commerce and hard discounters may result in consumer price deflation, which may affect our relationships with key retail\ncustomers. Further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. If these e-commerce and hard discounter retailers were to take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers and/or we fail to adapt to the rapidly changing retail and e-commerce landscapes, including finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses, our ability to maintain and grow our profitability, share of sales or volume and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, the retail landscape continues to be impacted by the increased consolidation of retail ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, which may impact our ability to compete in these areas. Such retailers or buying groups demand improved efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further, should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks, other distribution channels such as e-commerce, or private label brands, the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded. In addition, such consolidation can continue to adversely impact our smaller customers\u2019 ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, the growth of hard discounters that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label brands may continue to reduce our ability to sell our products through such retailers. Failure to appropriately respond to any of the foregoing, including failure to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers, can reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space and product availability at our retailers, adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow our share of sales or volume, and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets would be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nRating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, and result in a reduction in our liquidity. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings can impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market can also be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to successfully implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively, our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize information technology support services and administrative functions in certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. We may enter into new or additional agreements for shared services in other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies as we continue to migrate to shared business service organizational models across our business\noperations. In addition, we increasingly utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process, transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees, customers, consumers and other third parties. Failure by these third-party service providers or vendors to perform effectively, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance (including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements), has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings, additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers, damage to our reputation or our being subject to litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale. In addition, the management of multiple third-party service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control.\nWe continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently, and remain in step with the changing needs of our business, which can result in the loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In addition, the failure to either deliver the applications on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, can lead to business disruption and loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls, including our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. To date, this transition has not materially affected, and we do not expect it to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nFluctuations in exchange rates impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the United States, particularly in Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and Brazil, generate a significant portion of our net revenue. In addition, we purchase many of the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous markets and in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations or damage our reputation.\nThere is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits and potatoes. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain and unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumers\u2019 ability to purchase, our products.\nConcern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience disruptions in, or significant increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and be required to make additional investments in facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions can substantially increase the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby substantially increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations\nIn addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact and recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including plastic. Our reputation can be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment.\nA portion of our workforce is represented by unions. Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages, can cause our business to suffer.\nMany of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions can occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms or if we are unable to otherwise manage changes in, or that affect, our workforce, which can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or lead to a loss of sales, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements can also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy.\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, the value of our products or brands, or our competitive position, can be reduced, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business. These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to a variety of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret laws, third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our intellectual property, although the laws of various jurisdictions have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and trade secrets, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property, the value of our products and brands, or our competitive position, can be reduced, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly,\nsuch finding can have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products.\nPotential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients including sugar, sodium and saturated fat, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others, environmental, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate such matters to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses and establish reserves as appropriate. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in these matters, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In the event that management\u2019s assessment of actual or potential claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries or investigations that are material arise in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Responding to litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries, and investigations, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany factors can adversely affect the price of our publicly traded securities.\nMany factors can adversely affect the price of our common stock and publicly traded debt. Such factors, some of which are beyond our control, have in the past and could continue to include, but are not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; changes in financial or tax reporting and changes in accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results; investor perceptions of our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; actions by shareholders or others seeking to influence our business strategies; speculation by the media or investment community regarding our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; developments relating to pending litigation, claims, inquiries or investigations; changes in laws and regulations applicable to our products or business operations; trading activity in our securities or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our securities; changes in our credit ratings; the impact of our share repurchase programs or dividend policy; and the outcome of referenda and elections. In addition, corporate actions, such as those we have or have not taken in the past or may or may not take in the future as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure and our strategy, including as a result of business, legal, regulatory and tax considerations, have not and may not in the future have the impact we intend, resulting in adversely effects on the price of our securities. The above factors, as well as the other risks included in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d can adversely affect the price of our securities.",

Risk Factors\u201d for further information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces.\nOur Operations\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers and competition. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas.\nOther Relationships\nCertain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.\nOur Business Risks\nWe are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.\nWe sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.\nIn addition, our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Our provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018 and while our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For further information, see \u201cOur Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d \u201cOur Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOn May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF, effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF in 2019 resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2019, we recorded net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to December 28, 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. See \u201cOur Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nSee also \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d \u201cExecutive Overview\u201d above and \u201cMarket Risks\u201d below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.\nRisk Management Framework\nThe achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company\u2019s operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:\n\u2022\nPepsiCo\u2019s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo\u2019s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board\u2019s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company\u2019s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company\u2019s top risks. The Board receives updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to cybersecurity. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.\n\u25e6\nThe Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo\u2019s risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Board\u2019s oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo;\n\u25e6\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo\u2019s employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;\n\u25e6\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company\u2019s governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and\n\u25e6\nThe Public Policy and Sustainability Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo\u2019s policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability and public policy matters.\n\u2022\nThe PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board;\n\u2022\nDivision and key country risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;\n\u2022\nPepsiCo\u2019s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between\nthe parties, as well as with PepsiCo\u2019s Board of Directors, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board;\n\u2022\nPepsiCo\u2019s Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and\n\u2022\nPepsiCo\u2019s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.\nMarket Risks\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:\n\u2022\ncommodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and\n\u2022\ninterest rates.\nIn the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion of our market risks, and see \u201cOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments.\nThe fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. See \u201cOur Critical Accounting Policies\u201d for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.\nInflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion.\nCommodity Prices\nOur commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. At the end of 2019, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2019 by $106 million.\nForeign Exchange\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our consolidated net revenue in 2019, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and Brazil, collectively, comprising approximately 22% of our consolidated net revenue in 2019. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business, as well as the proposed acquisition of Pioneer Foods. During 2019, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points, reflecting declines in the euro, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and Argentine peso. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the Europe segment and our other businesses.\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $2.0 billion as of December 29, 2018. At the end of 2019, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2019 by $135 million.\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.5 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $0.9 billion as of December 29, 2018.\nInterest Rates\nOur interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $5.0 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $10.5 billion as of December 29, 2018. Assuming year-end 2019 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2019 by $25 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents as compared with our variable rate debt.\nOUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nResults of Operations - Consolidated Review\nVolume\nBeverage volume reflects sales of concentrate and beverage products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks to authorized bottlers, independent distributors and retailers. Concentrate beverage volume is sold to franchised-owned bottlers and independent distributors. Finished goods beverage volume is sold to retailers and independent distributors and includes direct shipments to retailers. Beverage volume is measured in bottler case sales (BCS), which converts all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. We believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the customer level. In our franchised-owned business, beverage revenue is based on concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), representing physical concentrate volume shipments to such customers. As a result, for our franchise-owned businesses, BCS and CSE are not typically equal during any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. Sales of products from our unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected in our reported volume. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi.\nFood and snack volume is reported on a system-wide basis, which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliates of snacks bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. In addition, FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group.\nServings\nSince our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions\u2019 physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.\nIn 2019, total servings increased 4% compared to 2018, primarily reflecting our acquisition of SodaStream. In 2018, total servings increased 1% compared to 2017.\nConsolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit\nSee \u201cResults of Operations - Division Review\u201d for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.\nOperating profit grew 2% and operating profit margin declined 0.3 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by productivity savings of more than $1 billion and net revenue growth, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The operating profit margin decline primarily reflects higher advertising and marketing expenses.\nFavorable mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in corporate unallocated expenses (see \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d) contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. Gains on the refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Thailand and our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS in the prior year reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.\nOperating profit decreased 2% and operating profit margin declined 0.5 percentage points. The operating profit performance was driven by certain operating cost increases and a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings of more than $1 billion and net revenue growth.\nThe impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Jordan in 2017 and a 2017 gain associated with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2.5 percentage points. These impacts were offset by a 2-percentage-point positive impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Thailand and our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS in 2018. Items affecting comparability (see \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d) negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points and decreased operating profit margin by 0.5 percentage points, primarily due to higher mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in corporate unallocated expenses.\nResults of Operations - Division Review\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with a recent strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. Our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. See \u201cOur Operations\u201d in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d for further information.\nSee \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d and \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\nIn the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, \u201ceffective net pricing\u201d reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and \u201cnet pricing\u201d reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, \u201cacquisitions and divestitures\u201d reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nNet Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth\nOrganic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on organic revenue growth, see \u201cNon-GAAP Measures.\u201d\n(a)\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\n(b)\nExcludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, volume growth varies from the amounts disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE, as well as the mix of beverage volume sold by our company-owned and franchise-owned bottlers. Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE.\nOperating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis\nOperating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures. For further information on these measures see \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d and \u201cItems Affecting Comparability.\u201d\nOperating Profit and Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability\n(a)\nSee \u201cItems Affecting Comparability.\u201d\nOperating Profit Growth and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis\n(a)\nSee \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d for further information.\n(b)\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\nFLNA\nNet revenue grew 4.5% and volume grew 1%. The net revenue growth was driven by effective net pricing and volume growth. The volume growth reflects mid-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos, Cheetos and Ruffles and low-single-digit growth in variety packs, partially offset by a double-digit decline in trademark Santitas.\nOperating profit grew 5%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses.

These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings.\nNet revenue declined 1.5% and volume declined 0.5%. The net revenue performance reflects unfavorable net pricing and mix and the volume decline. The volume decline was driven by a double-digit decline in trademark Gamesa and a mid-single-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in oatmeal.\nOperating profit decreased slightly, reflecting certain operating cost increases, the net revenue performance and a 3-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 1-percentage-point positive contribution from insurance settlement recoveries related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico.\nPBNA\nNet revenue grew 3%, driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point to the net revenue growth. Volume decreased 1%, driven by a 3% decline in CSD volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected a mid-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio, partially offset by a low-single-digit decrease in our juice and juice drinks portfolio.\nOperating profit decreased 4%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses, an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and the volume decline. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings. Year-over-year gains on asset sales negatively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit performance. A gain associated with an insurance recovery positively contributed 1 percentage point to current-year operating profit performance and was offset by less-favorable insurance adjustments compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted the current-year operating profit performance by 1 percentage point. Additionally, a prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act positively contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit performance.\nNet revenue grew 1%, driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Volume decreased 1%, driven by a 3% decline in CSD volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in non-carbonated beverage volume. The non-carbonated beverage volume increase primarily reflected a high-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio. Additionally, a low-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks was offset by a low-single-digit decline in our juice and juice drinks portfolio.\nOperating profit decreased 16%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including increased transportation costs, a 7-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and the net revenue growth. Higher gains on asset sales positively contributed 1.5 percentage points to operating profit performance. A bonus extended to certain U.S. employees related to the TCJ Act negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1.5 percentage points and was partially offset by 2017 costs related to hurricanes which positively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit performance.\nLatAm\nNet revenue increased 3%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by a 4-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange.\nSnacks volume experienced a slight decline, reflecting a high-single-digit decline in Brazil, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Mexico.\nBeverage volume grew 4%, reflecting high-single-digit growth in Brazil and Guatemala, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Argentina and a low-single-digit decline in Colombia.

Higher restructuring and impairment charges reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points.\nOther Consolidated Results\n(a)\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n(b)\nSee \u201cNon-GAAP Measures.\u201d\n(c)\nDoes not sum due to rounding.\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits expense increased $342 million, primarily reflecting settlement charges of $220 million related to the purchase of a group annuity contract and settlement charges of $53 million related to one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits.\nNet interest expense decreased $284 million reflecting the prior-year charge of $253 million in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes, as well as gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. This decrease also reflects lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances. These impacts were partially offset by lower interest income due to lower average cash balances.\nThe reported tax rate increased 57.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations, which increased the current-year reported tax rate by 47 percentage points. Additionally, the prior-year favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively, increased the current-year reported tax rate by 8 percentage points. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nNet income attributable to PepsiCo decreased 42% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share decreased 41%. Items affecting comparability (see \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d) negatively impacted\nboth net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 38 percentage points.\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $65 million, reflecting the impact of the $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States, as well as the recognition of net asset gains, partially offset by higher amortization of net losses.\nNet interest expense increased $312 million reflecting a charge of $253 million in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. This increase also reflects higher interest rates on debt balances, as well as losses on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by higher interest income due to higher interest rates on cash balances.\nThe reported tax rate decreased 85.6 percentage points, reflecting both other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations, which reduced the reported tax rate by 45 percentage points, and the 2017 provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act, which reduced the 2018 reported tax rate by 25 percentage points. Additionally, the favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively, reduced the reported tax rate by 7 percentage points. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nNet income attributable to PepsiCo increased 158% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 160%. Items affecting comparability (see \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d) positively contributed 150 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and 152 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nCertain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.\nWe consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nIn addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below.\nCost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/income, interest expense, provision for/benefit from income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share - diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates\nThese measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans, inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily associated with our acquisition of SodaStream, pension-related settlement charges, net tax related to the TCJ Act, other net tax benefits and charges related to cash tender and exchange offers (see \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share - diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance.\nOrganic revenue growth\nWe define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Starting in 2018, our reported results reflected the accounting policy election taken in conjunction with the adoption of the revenue recognition guidance to exclude from net revenue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions not already excluded. Our 2018 organic revenue growth excluded the impact of approximately $75 million of these taxes previously recognized in net revenue.\nWe believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\nSee \u201cNet Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth\u201d in \u201cResults of Operations - Division Review\u201d for further information.\nFree cash flow\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.\nSee \u201cFree Cash Flow\u201d in \u201cOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further information.\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability\nWe define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders\u2019 equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.\nWe believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.\nSee \u201cReturn on Invested Capital\u201d in \u201cOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further information.\nItems Affecting Comparability\nOur reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years:\n(a)\nProvision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction.\nMark-to-Market Net Impact\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges\n2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\nThe 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and\ninformation systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, of which we have incurred $508 million plan to date through December 28, 2019 and cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion, of which we have incurred approximately $261 million plan to date through December 28, 2019. We expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $450 million and cash expenditures of approximately $400 million in our 2020 financial results, with the balance to be reflected in our 2021 through 2023 financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2020 and 2021 results.\n2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\nThe 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million, respectively.\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans.\nWe regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges\nIn 2019, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges of $55 million ($47 million after-tax or $0.03 per share), including $46 million in our Europe segment, $7 million in our AMESA segment and $2 million in corporate unallocated expenses. These charges are primarily related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in SodaStream\u2019s balance sheet at the acquisition date, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-related costs.\nIn 2018, we recorded merger and integration charges of $75 million ($0.05 per share), including $57 million in our Europe segment and $18 million in corporate unallocated expenses, related to our acquisition of SodaStream. These charges include closing costs, advisory fees and employee-related costs.\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nPension-Related Settlement Charges\nIn 2019, we recorded pension settlement charges of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share), reflecting settlement charges of $220 million ($170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share) related to the purchase of a group annuity contract and settlement charges of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) related to one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nNet Tax Related to the TCJ Act\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018.\nIn 2017, we recorded a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act.\nWe recognized net tax benefits of $8 million ($0.01 per share) and $28 million ($0.02 per share) in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the TCJ Act.\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOther Net Tax Benefits\nIn 2018, we reorganized our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result, we recognized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ($3.05 per share). Also in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits associated with both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS, collectively, resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $717 million ($0.50 per share).\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nCharges Related to Cash Tender and Exchange Offers\nIn 2018, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253 million ($191 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, bridge loan facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments, the proposed acquisition of Pioneer Foods and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper, bridge loan facilities and long-term debt and cash and cash equivalents. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our revolving credit facilities and bridge loan facilities. See also \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cOur Business Risks\u201d for further discussion.\nAs of December 28, 2019, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.\nThe TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 28, 2019, our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $0.1 billion of this liability in 2020. See \u201cCredit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments.\u201d Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.\nFurthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.\nThe table below summarizes our cash activity:\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $9.6 billion, compared to $9.4 billion in the prior year. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year, partially offset by higher net cash tax payments in the current year.\nDuring 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $9.4 billion, compared to $10.0 billion in 2017. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects discretionary contributions of $1.5 billion to our pension and retiree medical plans in 2018, partially offset by lower net cash tax payments in 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2019, net cash used for investing activities was $6.4 billion, primarily reflecting $4.1 billion of net capital spending, as well as $1.9 billion of the remaining cash paid in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream.\nDuring 2018, net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 billion, primarily reflecting net maturities and sales of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $8.7 billion, partially offset by net capital spending of $3.1 billion and $1.2 billion of cash paid, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream.\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities.\nWe expect 2020 net capital spending to be approximately $5 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $8.3 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0 billion and debt redemptions of $1.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.6 billion.\nDuring 2018, net cash used for financing activities was $13.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.9 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0 billion, cash tender and exchange offers of $1.6 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $1.4 billion.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.\nWe annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. On February 13, 2020, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.09 per share from $3.82 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2020. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.5 billion to shareholders in 2020 through share repurchases of approximately $2 billion and dividends of approximately $5.5 billion.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see \u201cNon-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nThe table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected in our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow.\nWe use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cOur Business Risks\u201d for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.\nAny downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our\nfuture borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d \u201cOur Business Risks\u201d and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCredit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities.\nThe following table summarizes our long-term contractual commitments by period:\n(a)\nBased on year-end foreign exchange rates.\n(b)\nExcludes $2,848 million related to current maturities of debt, $6 million related to the fair value adjustments for debt acquired in acquisitions and interest rate swaps and payments of $163 million related to unamortized net discounts.\n(c)\nPrimarily reflects building leases. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on operating leases.\n(d)\nReflects our transition tax liability as of December 28, 2019, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act.\n(e)\nInterest payments on floating-rate debt are estimated using interest rates effective as of December 28, 2019. Includes accrued interest of $305 million as of December 28, 2019.\n(f)\nReflects non-cancelable commitments, primarily for the purchase of commodities and outsourcing services in the normal course of business and does not include purchases that we are likely to make based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur.\n(g)\nReflects non-cancelable commitments, primarily for sports marketing in the normal course of business.\nReserves for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any such settlements. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in the table above as it is negotiated on an annual basis. Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in the table above. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\nWe coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly. Consequently, transactions between our independent bottlers and suppliers are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party, we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our independent bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote.\nReturn on Invested Capital\nROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on ROIC, see \u201cNon-GAAP Measures.\u201d\n(a)\nResults include the impact of the TCJ Act. Additionally, our 2018 results included other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n(b)\nAverage debt obligations includes a quarterly average of short-term and long-term debt obligations.\n(c)\nAverage common shareholders\u2019 equity includes a quarterly average of common stock, capital in excess of par value, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive loss and repurchased common stock.\nThe table below reconciles ROIC as calculated above to net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability.\n(a)\nSee \u201cItem 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d for further information.\nOUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAn appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans, our critical accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies with our Audit Committee.\nOur critical accounting policies are:\n\u2022\nrevenue recognition;\n\u2022\ngoodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nincome tax expense and accruals; and\n\u2022\npension and retiree medical plans.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\nWe estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data.\nOur policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.\nAs discussed in \u201cOur Customers\u201d in \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\nA number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.\nWe believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.\nIn connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management\u2019s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cOur Business Risks.\u201d\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.\nSee Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIncome Tax Expense and Accruals\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws or tax authority settlements. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion.\nAn estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items.\nTax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe recorded a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) in 2018, related to the TCJ Act. Our provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018 and while our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million ($0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019 and adjustments related to the filing of our 2018 U.S. federal tax return. See further information in \u201cItems Affecting Comparability.\u201d\nOn May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF, effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF in 2019 resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2019, we recorded net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to December 28, 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results.\nIn 2019, our annual tax rate was 21.0% compared to (36.7)% in 2018, as discussed in \u201cOther Consolidated Results.\u201d The tax rate increased 57.7 percentage points compared to 2018, primarily reflecting the prior-year other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations, which increased the current-year reported tax rate by 47 percentage points. Additionally, the prior-year favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively, increased the current-year reported tax rate by 8 percentage points.\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nPension and Retiree Medical Plans\nOur pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.\nIn 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220 million ($170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share).\nAlso in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant\u2019s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share).\nEffective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were reorganized into Plan A and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I) to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of these changes, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42 million ($27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.\nSee \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur Assumptions\nThe determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.\nSignificant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:\n\u2022\ncertain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;\n\u2022\nthe expected return on assets in our funded plans;\n\u2022\nfor pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings;\n\u2022\nfor retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and\n\u2022\nfor pension and retiree medical expense, the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities.\nCertain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management\u2019s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.\nAt each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans\u2019 investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.\nThe health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans\u2019 liability and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers.\nWeighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:\nIn 2019, we incurred pension settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract of $220 million and one-time lump sum settlements of $53 million to certain former employees who had vested benefits. In addition, based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2020 primarily driven by the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets and the impact of approved plan contributions, primarily offset by the decrease in discount rates.\nSensitivity of Assumptions\nA decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2020 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:\nFunding\nWe make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.\nWe made discretionary contributions to Plan A in the United States of $150 million in January 2020, $400 million in 2019 and $1.4 billion in 2018.\nOur pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nFiscal years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017\n(in millions except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nFiscal years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017\n(in millions)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nFiscal years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017\n(in millions)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nDecember 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018\n(in millions except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statement of Equity\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nFiscal years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017\n(in millions)\n(a) Cash dividends declared per common share were $3.7925, $3.5875 and $3.1675 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.\nRaw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived brands, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. Certain operations in our Europe segment report on a weekly calendar basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for the three years presented:\nUnless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years\u2019 consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\nOur Divisions\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned our ESSA and AMENA reportable segments to be consistent\nwith a recent strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. As a result, our beverage, food and snack businesses in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia that were part of our former AMENA segment and our businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa that were part of our former ESSA segment are now reported together as our AMESA segment. The remaining beverage, food and snack businesses that were part of our former AMENA segment are now reported together as our APAC segment and our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe are now reported as our Europe segment.\nThese changes did not impact our FLNA, QFNA, PBNA or LatAm reportable segments or our consolidated financial results.\nOur historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure.\nWe are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:\n1)\nFLNA, which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada;\n2)\nQFNA, which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada;\n3)\nPBNA, which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;\n4)\nLatAm, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America;\n5)\nEurope, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe;\n6)\nAMESA, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and\n7)\nAPAC, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region.\nThrough our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and Brazil.\nThe accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies:\n\u2022\nshare-based compensation expense;\n\u2022\npension and retiree medical expense; and\n\u2022\nderivatives.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nOur divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.\nThe allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:\nThe expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.\nPension and Retiree Medical Expense\nPension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.\nDerivatives\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.\nNet revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows:\n(a)\nOur primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products to our customers, with our food and snack business representing approximately 55% of our consolidated net revenue. Internationally, LatAm\u2019s food and snack business is approximately 90% of the segment\u2019s net revenue, Europe\u2019s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 55% and 45%, respectively, of the segment\u2019s net revenue, AMESA\u2019s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 40% and 60%, respectively, of the segment\u2019s net revenue and APAC\u2019s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 25% and 75%, respectively, of the segment\u2019s net revenue. Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, is approximately 40% of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our\nfinished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. See Note 2 for further information.\nCorporate Unallocated Expenses\nCorporate unallocated expenses include costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as commodity derivative gains and losses, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives, unallocated research and development costs, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, and certain other items.\nOther Division Information\nTotal assets and capital spending of each division are as follows:\n(a)\nCorporate assets consist principally of certain cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, derivative instruments, property, plant and equipment and tax assets. In 2019, the change in assets was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Refer to the cash flow statement for additional information.\nAmortization of intangible assets and depreciation and other amortization of each division are as follows:\nNet revenue and long-lived assets by country are as follows:\n(a)\nLong-lived assets represent property, plant and equipment, indefinite-lived intangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and investments in noncontrolled affiliates. These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used.\nNote 2 - Our Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts.\nThe transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\nAs a result of the implementation of the revenue recognition guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018, which did not have a material impact on our accounting policies, we recorded an adjustment in the first quarter of 2018 of $137 million to beginning retained earnings to reflect marketplace spending that our customers and independent bottlers expect to be entitled to in line with revenue recognition. In addition, starting in 2018, we excluded from net revenue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions. The impact of these taxes previously recognized in net revenue and cost of sales was approximately $75 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, with no impact on operating profit.\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\nWe estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses on our income statement.\nWe are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. In 2019, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam\u2019s) represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.\nTotal Marketplace Spending\nWe offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\nA number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\nThe terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year, and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $272 million as of December 28, 2019 and $218 million as of December 29, 2018 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.\nFor interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period\u2019s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.\nAdvertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.7 billion in 2019, $4.2 billion in 2018 and $4.1 billion in 2017, including advertising expenses of $3.0 billion in 2019, $2.6 billion in 2018 and $2.4 billion in 2017. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:\n\u2022\nmedia and personal service prepayments;\n\u2022\npromotional materials in inventory; and\n\u2022\nproduction costs of future media advertising.\nDeferred advertising costs of $55 million and $47 million as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.\nDistribution Costs\nDistribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $10.9 billion in 2019, $10.5 billion in 2018 and $9.9 billion in 2017.\nSoftware Costs\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $166 million in 2019, $204 million in 2018 and $224 million in 2017. Net capitalized software and development costs were $572 million and $577 million as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $711 million, $680 million and $737 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite lived-intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management\u2019s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market\ninformation and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.\nSee Note 4 for further information.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nOur other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:\n\u2022\nBasis of Presentation - Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation.\n\u2022\nProperty, Plant and Equipment - Note 4.\n\u2022\nIncome Taxes - Note 5.\n\u2022\nShare-Based Compensation - Note 6.\n\u2022\nPension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans - Note 7.\n\u2022\nFinancial Instruments - Note 9.\n\u2022\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n\u2022\nInventories - Note 15. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in, first-out (FIFO) or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods.\n\u2022\nTranslation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries - Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders\u2019 equity as currency translation adjustment.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted\nIn 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to the TCJ Act for the optional reclassification of the residual tax effects, arising from the change in corporate tax rate, in accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in other comprehensive income at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the TCJ Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019; however, we did not elect to make the optional reclassification.\nIn 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. Under this guidance, certain of our derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that did not previously qualify for hedge accounting treatment can now qualify prospectively. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2019; the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. See Note 9 for further information.\nIn 2016, the FASB issued guidance on leases, with amendments issued in 2018. The guidance requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet, but does not change the manner in which expenses are recorded\nin the income statement. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the modified retrospective transition approach, which requires application of the guidance for all comparative periods presented, and the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires prospective application at the adoption date.\nWe utilized a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including the increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio from both a lessor and lessee perspective. We completed our comprehensive review of our lease portfolio, including significant leases by geography and by asset type that were impacted by the new guidance, and enhanced our controls. In addition, we implemented a new software platform, and corresponding controls, for administering our leases and facilitating compliance with the new guidance.\nWe adopted the guidance prospectively during the first quarter of 2019. As part of our adoption, we elected not to reassess historical lease classification, recognize short-term leases on our balance sheet, nor separate lease and non-lease components for our real estate leases. In addition, we utilized the portfolio approach to group leases with similar characteristics and did not use hindsight to determine lease term. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, resulting in an increase of 2% to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, and had an immaterial increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2019. See Note 13 for further information.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted\nIn 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption.\nIn 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. For our trade, certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments, we will be required to use a new forward-looking expected credit loss model that will replace the existing incurred credit loss model, which would generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2020. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nNote 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges\nA summary of our restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives is as follows:\n2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\nThe 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion and cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 70% of severance and other employee-related costs, 15% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to complete this plan by 2023.\nThe total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:\nA summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows:\n(a)\nIncludes other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs, consulting and other professional fees.\nA summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity is as follows:\n(a)\nExcludes cash expenditures of $4 million reported in the cash flow statement in pension and retiree medical contributions.\nSubstantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 28, 2019 is expected to be paid by the end of 2020.\n2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\nThe 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, included the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believed would strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above that further strengthened our beverage, food and snack businesses.\nThe 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. In 2019, there were no material pre-tax charges related to this plan and all cash payments were paid at year end. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million, respectively. These total plan pre-tax charges consisted of 59% of severance and other employee costs, 15% of asset impairments and 26% of other costs, including costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including certain consulting and other contract termination costs. These total plan pre-tax charges were incurred by division as follows: FLNA 14%, QFNA 3%, PBNA 29%, LatAm 15%, Europe 23%, AMESA 3%, APAC 3% and Corporate 10%.\nA summary of our 2014 Productivity Plan charges is as follows:\n(a)\nIncome amount primarily reflects a gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment.\n(b)\nIncome amount primarily relates to other pension and retiree medical benefits.\nA summary of our 2014 Productivity Plan activity is as follows:\n(a)\nIncome amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates and a gain on the sale of property, plant, and equipment.\n(b)\nExcludes cash expenditures of $11 million reported in the cash flow statement in pension and retiree medical plan contributions.\nOther Productivity Initiatives\nThere were no material charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans.\nWe regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives described above.\nNote 4 - Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets\nA summary of our property, plant and equipment is as follows:\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation and amortization are recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.\nA summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows:\n(a)\nThe change from 2018 to 2019 primarily reflects revisions to the purchase price allocation for our acquisition of SodaStream.\nAmortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 28, 2019 and using average 2019 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:\nDepreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. We did not recognize any material impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in each of the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. As of December 28, 2019, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an\nimpairment of the carrying value of PBNA\u2019s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PBNA\u2019s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia and Brazil on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in these countries and have concluded that there were no impairments for the year ended December 28, 2019. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of certain brands in these countries, including juice and dairy brands in Russia, if there is a deterioration in these conditions, if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions), if there are significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.\nThe change in the book value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is as follows:\n(a)\nThe change in acquisitions/(divestitures) in 2019 is primarily related to our acquisition of CytoSport Inc.\n(b)\nThe change in acquisitions/(divestitures) in 2019 and 2018 is primarily related to our acquisition of SodaStream. See Note 14 for further information.\n(c)\nThe change in translation and other in 2019 primarily reflects the appreciation of the Russian ruble. The change in translation and other in 2018 primarily reflects the depreciation of the Russian ruble, euro and Pound sterling.\nNote 5 - Income Taxes\nThe components of income before income taxes are as follows:\nThe provision for/(benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following:\nA reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to our annual tax rate is as follows:\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018.\nIn 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period, not to exceed one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act is not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAs a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion recognized in 2017, was a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This provisional mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required\nremeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. The effect of the remeasurement was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act, and reflected in our provision for income taxes.\nThe provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, in 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) related to the TCJ Act, primarily reflecting the impact of the final analysis of certain foreign exchange gains or losses, substantiation of foreign tax credits, as well as cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2018, the tax year-end of our foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by additional transition tax guidance issued by the United States Department of Treasury, as well as the TCJ Act impact of both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, each discussed below.\nWhile our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million ($0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019 and adjustments related to the filing of our 2018 U.S. federal tax return.\nAs of December 28, 2019, our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $663 million in 2019 and $150 million in 2018. We currently expect to pay approximately $0.1 billion of this liability in 2020.\nThe TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. During the first quarter of 2018, we elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.\nOther Tax Matters\nOn May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF, effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF in 2019 resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2019, we recorded net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to December 28, 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results.\nIn 2018, we reorganized certain of our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result, we recognized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ($3.05 per share) in 2018. The related deferred tax asset of $4.4 billion is being amortized over a period of 15 years beginning in 2019. Additionally, the reorganization generated significant net operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized, resulting in the recording of a full valuation allowance.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following:\nA summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows:\nReserves\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows:\nIn 2018, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $364 million ($0.26 per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain international tax audits. Additionally, in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $353 million ($0.24 per share) as a result of our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits\nof taxable years 2012 and 2013, including the associated state impact. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS, collectively, resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $717 million ($0.50 per share) in 2018.\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.\nAs of December 28, 2019, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $1.4 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $250 million as of December 28, 2019, of which $84 million of tax expense was recognized in 2019. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $179 million as of December 29, 2018, of which $64 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2018.\nA reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nCarryforwards and Allowances\nOperating loss carryforwards totaling $24.7 billion at year-end 2019 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion in 2020, $20.3 billion between 2021 and 2039 and $4.2 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nUndistributed International Earnings\nIn 2018, we repatriated $20.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held in our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability, related to the TCJ Act. As of December 28, 2019, we had approximately $6 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $6 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\nNote 6 - Share-Based Compensation\nOur share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees\u2019 interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, PEPunits and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.\nThe Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits.\nAs of December 28, 2019, 59 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.\nThe following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense and excess tax benefits recognized:\n(a)\nPrimarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n(b)\nReflects tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year.\nAs of December 28, 2019, there was $284 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.\nMethod of Accounting and Our Assumptions\nThe fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.\nWe do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.\nStock Options\nA stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.\nOur weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:\nThe expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price.\nA summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 28, 2019 is as follows:\n(a)\nOptions are in thousands and include options previously granted under the PBG plan. No additional options or shares were granted under the PBG plan after 2009.\n(b)\nIn thousands.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units\nEach RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo\u2019s performance against specified financial and/or operational performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant.\nA summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 28, 2019 is as follows:\n(a)\nIn thousands.\n(b)\nGrant activity for all PSUs are disclosed at target.\n(c)\nReflects the net number of PSUs above and below target levels based on actual performance measured at the end of the performance period.\n(d)\nThe outstanding PSUs for which the performance period has not ended as of December 28, 2019, at the threshold, target and maximum award levels were zero, 0.7 million and 1.3 million, respectively.\nPEPunits\nPEPunits provide an opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon changes in PepsiCo\u2019s absolute stock price as well as PepsiCo\u2019s Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a three-year performance period.\nThe fair value of PEPunits is measured using the Monte-Carlo simulation model, which incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, until actual performance is determined.\nPEPunits were last granted in 2015 and all 248,000 units outstanding at December 30, 2017, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $68.94, were converted to 278,000 shares in 2018.\nLong-Term Cash\nCertain executive officers and other senior executives were granted long-term cash awards for which final payout is based on PepsiCo\u2019s Total Shareholder Return relative to a specific set of peer companies and achievement of a specified performance target over a three-year performance period.\nLong-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation guidance are valued through the end of the performance period on a mark-to-market basis using the Monte Carlo simulation model.\nA summary of our long-term cash activity for the year ended December 28, 2019 is as follows:\n(a)\nIn thousands.\n(b)\nGrant activity for all long-term cash awards are disclosed at target.\n(c)\nReflects the net number of long-term cash awards above and below target levels based on actual performance measured at the end of the performance period.\n(d)\nThe outstanding long-term cash awards for which the performance period has not ended as of December 28, 2019, at the threshold, target and maximum award levels were zero, 28.5 million and 57.1 million, respectively.\nOther Share-Based Compensation Data\nThe following is a summary of other share-based compensation data:\n(a)\nIn thousands.\nAs of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, there were approximately 269,000 and 248,000 outstanding awards, respectively, consisting primarily of phantom stock units that were granted under the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program and will be settled in shares of PepsiCo common stock pursuant to the LTIP at the end of the applicable deferral period, not included in the tables above.\nNote 7 - Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans\nIn 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220 million ($170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share).\nAlso in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant\u2019s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share).\nEffective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were reorganized into Plan A and Plan I. Actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of this change, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42 million ($27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.\nGains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 10 years) and retiree medical (approximately 8 years), or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 23 years). The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I.\nSelected financial information for our pension and retiree medical plans is as follows:\nThe net (gain)/loss arising in the current year is attributed to the change in discount rate, primarily offset by the actual asset returns different from expected returns.\nThe amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the\nvalue of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.\nThe amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:\n\u2022\nInterest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.\n\u2022\nExpected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.\n\u2022\nAmortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments.\n\u2022\nAmortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.\n\u2022\nSettlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Curtailments are due to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).\n\u2022\nSpecial termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.\nThe components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows:\n(a)\nIn 2019, U.S. includes settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract of $220 million and a pension lump sum settlement charge of $53 million.\nThe following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to determine projected benefit liability and net periodic benefit cost for our pension and retiree medical plans:\nThe following table provides selected information about plans with accumulated benefit obligation and total projected benefit liability in excess of plan assets:\nOf the total projected pension benefit liability as of December 28, 2019, approximately $847 million relates to plans that we do not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment.\nFuture Benefit Payments\nOur estimated future benefit payments are as follows:\n(a)\nExpected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $2 million for each of the years from 2020 through 2024 and approximately $4 million in total for 2025 through 2029.\nThese future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.\nFunding\nContributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows:\n(a)\nIncludes $400 million contribution in 2019 and $1.4 billion contribution in 2018 to fund Plan A in the United States.\nIn January 2020, we made discretionary contributions of $150 million to Plan A in the United States. In addition, in 2020, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $150 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and approximately $60 million for retiree medical benefits.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.\nPlan Assets\nOur pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans\u2019 benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected liabilities. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.\nFor 2020 and 2019, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.8% and 7.1%, respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:\nActual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.\nThe expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.\nPlan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2019 and 2018 are categorized consistently by level, and are as follows:\n(a)\n2019 and 2018 amounts include $302 million and $285 million, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries.\n(b)\nThe equity securities portfolio was invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio in the U.S. was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. The common stock is based on quoted prices in active markets. The commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and the U.S. commingled funds include one large-cap fund that represents 16% and 15% of total U.S. plan assets for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The preferred stock investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets.\n(c)\nThese investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represent 28% of total U.S. plan assets for both 2019 and 2018.\n(d)\nBased on the fair value of the contracts as determined by the insurance companies using inputs that are not observable. The changes in Level 3 amounts were not significant in the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.\n(e)\nThe real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. These funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. The majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days.\n(f)\nBased on the published price of the fund.\nRetiree Medical Cost Trend Rates\nThese assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability, however the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact.\nSavings Plan\nCertain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement, and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.\nCertain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.\nIn 2019, 2018 and 2017, our total Company contributions were $197 million, $180 million and $176 million, respectively.\nNote 8 - Debt Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our debt obligations:\n(a)\nAmounts are shown net of unamortized net discounts of $163 million and $119 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(b)\nThe interest rates presented reflect weighted-average effective interest rates at year-end. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates through the use of interest rate derivative instruments. See Note 9 for further information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments.\nAs of December 28, 2019, our international debt of $69 million was related to borrowings from external parties including various lines of credit. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings.\nIn 2019, we issued the following senior notes:\n(a)\nRepresents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums.\n(b)\nThese notes, issued in euros, were designated as net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.\nThe net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, except for an amount equivalent to the net proceeds from our 2.875% senior notes due 2049 that will be used to fund, in whole or in part, eligible green projects in the categories of investments in sustainable plastics and packaging, decarbonizing our operations and supply chain and water sustainability, which promote our selected Sustainable Development Goals, as defined by the United Nations.\nIn 2019, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) which expires on June 3, 2024. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period.\nIn 2019, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on June 1, 2020. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $3.75 billion five-year credit agreement and our $3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, both dated as of June 4, 2018. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 28, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.\nIn 2019, we entered into two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) which together enable one of our consolidated subsidiaries to borrow up to 25.0 billion South African rand, or approximately $1.8 billion, to provide potential funding for our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. Each facility is available from the date the conditions precedent are met for the acquisition up through July 30, 2020 in the case of one facility and July 31, 2020 in the case of the other facility. Borrowings under the facilities are for up to one year once drawn and can be prepaid at any time. Interest rates are reset either every one month or three months. As of December 28, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Loan Facilities.\nIn 2019, we paid $1.0 billion to redeem all $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due 2020.\nIn 2018, we completed a cash tender offer for certain notes issued by PepsiCo and predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for $1.6 billion in cash to redeem the following amounts:\nAlso in 2018, we completed an exchange offer for certain notes issued by predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for the following newly issued PepsiCo notes. These notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount equal to the exchanged notes:\nAs a result of the above transactions, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253 million ($191 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense in 2018, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes.\nNote 9 - Financial Instruments\nDerivatives and Hedging\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:\n\u2022\ncommodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and\n\u2022\ninterest rates.\nIn the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.\nOur hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument\u2019s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 28, 2019 were not material.\nCash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.\nWe do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.\nCertain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position on December 28, 2019 was $415 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 28, 2019.\nCommodity Prices\nWe are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for energy, agricultural products and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\nOur commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.\nForeign Exchange\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $2.0 billion as of December 29, 2018. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.5 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $0.9 billion as of December 29, 2018. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.\nInterest Rates\nWe centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.\nOur interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $5.0 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $10.5 billion as of December 29, 2018.\nAs of December 28, 2019, approximately 9% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 29% as of December 29, 2018.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\nInvestments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Our investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders\u2019 equity. Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in debt securities as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were not material. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. We recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for-sale debt securities for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.\nIn 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $95 million ($85 million after-tax or $0.06 per share), net of discount and fees, associated with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic. The gain on the sale of this equity investment was recorded in our Europe segment in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 are categorized as follows:\n(a)\nFair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.\n(b)\nBased on quoted broker prices or other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. As of December 29, 2018, these debt securities were primarily classified as cash equivalents. The decrease in available-for-sale debt securities was due to maturities and sales during the current year.\n(c)\nBased on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.\n(d)\nBased primarily on the price of our common stock.\n(e)\nBased on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees\u2019 investment elections.\n(f)\nBased on LIBOR forward rates. As of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $2.2 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, and classified on our balance sheet within short-term and long-term debt obligations. As of December 28, 2019, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was $5 million. As of December 28, 2019, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $49 million loss, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations.\n(g)\nBased on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates.\n(h)\nBased on quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets.\n(i)\nBased on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements.\n(j)\nDerivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions is classified as restricted cash. See Note 15 for further information.\nThe carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 28, 2019 and\nDecember 29, 2018 was $34 billion and $32 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.\nLosses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows:\n(a)\nForeign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in interest expense. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt, which are also included in interest expense. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity.\n(b)\nForeign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are included in interest expense. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity.\nBased on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net losses of $47 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months.\nNote 10 - Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share\nThe computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share are as follows:\n(a)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions).\n(b)\nSee Note 11 for further information.\n(c)\nThe dilutive effect of these securities is calculated using the treasury stock method.\nOut-of-the-money options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share are as follows:\n(a)\nIn millions.\nNote 11 - Preferred Stock\nIn connection with our merger with The Quaker Oats Company (Quaker) in 2001, shares of our convertible preferred stock were authorized and issued to an ESOP fund established by Quaker. Quaker made the final award to its ESOP in June 2001.\nIn 2018, all of the outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock were converted into an aggregate of 550,102 shares of our common stock. As a result, there are no shares of our convertible preferred stock outstanding as of December 29, 2018 and our convertible preferred stock is retired for accounting purposes.\nAs of December 30, 2017, there were 3 million shares of convertible preferred stock authorized, 803,953 preferred shares issued and 114,753 shares outstanding. The outstanding preferred shares had a fair value of $68 million as of December 30, 2017.\nActivities of our preferred stock are included in the equity statement.\nNote 12 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Attributable to PepsiCo\nThe changes in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to PepsiCo are as follows:\n(a)\nPension and retiree medical amounts are net of taxes of $1,280 million as of December 31, 2016, $1,338 million as of December 30, 2017, $1,466 million as of December 29, 2018 and $1,370 million as of December 28, 2019.\n(b)\nCurrency translation adjustment primarily reflects the appreciation of the euro, Russian ruble, Pound sterling and Canadian dollar.\n(c)\nCurrency translation adjustment primarily reflects the depreciation of the Russian ruble, Canadian dollar, Pound sterling and Brazilian real.\n(d)\nCurrency translation adjustment primarily reflects the appreciation of the Russian ruble, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Pound sterling.\nThe following table summarizes the reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the income statement:\nNote 13 - Leases\nLessee\nWe determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years, and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use\nassets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nWe have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).\nComponents of lease cost are as follows:\n(a)\nIncludes right-of-use asset amortization of $412 million.\n(b)\nPrimarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax.\n(c)\nNot recorded on our balance sheet.\nIn 2019, we recognized gains of $77 million on sale-leaseback transactions with terms under four years.\nSupplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:\nMaturities of lease liabilities by year for our operating leases are as follows:\nAs of December 29, 2018, minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases by period were expected to be as follows:\nA summary of rent expense for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 is as follows:\nLessor\nWe have various arrangements for certain foodservice and vending equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\nNote 14 - Acquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisition of Pioneer Food Group Ltd.\nOn July 19, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion. Also in 2019, one of our consolidated subsidiaries entered into Bridge Loan Facilities to provide potential funding for our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 8 for further information.\nThe transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and is expected to be recorded primarily in the AMESA segment. Closing is expected in the first half of 2020.\nAcquisition of SodaStream International Ltd.\nOn December 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of SodaStream, a manufacturer and distributor of sparkling water makers, for $144.00 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $3.3 billion. The total consideration transferred was approximately $3.3 billion (or $3.2 billion, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired).\nWe accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of SodaStream and the resulting goodwill as of the acquisition date, all of which are recorded in the Europe segment.\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of SodaStream primarily reflects the value of expected synergies from our product portfolios and is not deductible for tax purposes.\nRefranchising in Thailand\nIn 2018, we refranchised our beverage business in Thailand by selling a controlling interest in our Thailand bottling operations to form a joint venture, where we now have an equity method investment. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $144 million ($126 million after-tax or $0.09 per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses in our APAC segment as a result of this transaction.\nRefranchising in Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia\nIn 2018, we refranchised our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS.

These charges are primarily related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in SodaStream\u2019s balance sheet at the acquisition date, recorded in cost of sales, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-related costs, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIn 2018, we recorded merger and integration charges of $75 million ($0.05 per share), including $57 million in our Europe segment and $18 million in corporate unallocated expenses, related to our acquisition of SodaStream, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges include closing costs, advisory fees and employee-related costs.\nNote 15 - Supplemental Financial Information\nBalance Sheet\n(a)\nIncludes accounts written off.\n(b)\nIncludes adjustments related primarily to currency translation and other adjustments.\n(c)\nApproximately 7% and 5% of the inventory cost in 2019 and 2018, respectively, were computed using the LIFO method. The differences between LIFO and FIFO methods of valuing these inventories were not material.\n(d)\nSee Note 7 for further information.\n(e)\nSee Note 13 for further information.\nStatement of Cash Flows\n(a)\nIn 2018, excludes the premiums paid in accordance with the debt transactions discussed in Note 8.\n(b)\nIn 2019 and 2018, includes tax payments of $423 million and $115 million, respectively, related to the TCJ Act.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported within the balance sheet to the same items as reported in the cash flow statement.\n(a)\nIn 2018, primarily represents consideration held by our paying agent in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream.\n(b)\nPrimarily relates to collateral posted against our derivative asset or liability positions.\nNote 16 - Selected Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited)\nSelected financial data for 2019 and 2018 is summarized as follows and highlights certain items that impacted our quarterly results:\n(a)\nMark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses.\n(b)\nExpenses related to the 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans.

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of certain sales incentive accruals\nAs discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the \u201cAccounts payable and other current liabilities\u201d line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the Company\u2019s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends.\nThe primary procedures that we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s sales incentive process, including (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company\u2019s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals\nto actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.\nAssessment of the carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 28, 2019 was $30.1 billion which represents 38% of total assets, and includes PepsiCo Beverages North America\u2019s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of $8.6 billion as of December 28, 2019.\nWe identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA\u2019s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of Europe\u2019s juice and dairy brands in Russia as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company\u2019s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows.\nThe primary procedures that we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s indefinite-lived assets impairment process to develop the forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the Company\u2019s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company\u2019s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company\u2019s historical forecasted results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.\nEvaluation of unrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 28, 2019, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, or new tax law or tax authority settlements.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority\u2019s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years\u2019 tax returns in light of new information.\nThe primary procedures that we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority\u2019s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company\u2019s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company\u2019s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, and associated external counsel opinions.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1990.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 13, 2020\nGLOSSARY\nAcquisitions and divestitures: all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler Case Sales (BCS): measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nBottler funding: financial incentives we give to our independent bottlers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our beverage products.\nConcentrate Shipments and Equivalents (CSE): measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers, retailers and independent distributors.\nConstant currency: financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.\nConsumers: people who eat and drink our products.\nCSD: carbonated soft drinks.\nCustomers: authorized independent bottlers, distributors and retailers.\nDirect-Store-Delivery (DSD): delivery system used by us and our independent bottlers to deliver snacks and beverages directly to retail stores where our products are merchandised.\nEffective net pricing: reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nFree cash flow: net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment.\nIndependent bottlers: customers to whom we have granted exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographical area.\nMark-to-market net impact: change in market value for commodity derivative contracts that we purchase to mitigate the volatility in costs of energy and raw materials that we consume.
