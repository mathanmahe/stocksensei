To address these requirements, manufacturers often use integrated circuit-based embedded control systems that enable them to:\n\u2022differentiate their products\n\u2022replace less efficient electromechanical control devices\n\u2022reduce the number of components in their system\n\u2022add product functionality\n\u2022reduce the system level energy consumption\n\u2022make systems safer to operate\n\u2022reduce the consumption of natural resources\n\u2022add security to their products\n\u2022decrease time to market for their products\n\u2022significantly reduce product cost\nEmbedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide, including:\n\u2022actuators\n\u2022applications requiring touch buttons, touch screens and graphical user interfaces\n\u2022automotive access control\n\u2022automotive comfort, safety, information and entertainment applications\n\u2022avionics\n\u2022communication infrastructure systems\n\u2022consumer electronics\n\u2022data center solutions\n\u2022defense and military hardware\n\u2022electric vehicles\n\u2022handheld tools\n\u2022home and building automation\n\u2022industrial automation\n\u2022large and small home appliances\n\u2022medical devices\n\u2022motor controls\n\u2022portable computers and accessories\n\u2022power supplies\n\u2022residential and commercial security systems\n\u2022robotics\n\u2022routers and video surveillance systems\n\u2022satellites\n\u2022smart home and IoT edge devices\n\u2022smart meters and energy monitoring\n\u2022storage and server systems\n\u2022touch control\n\u2022wireless communication\nEmbedded control systems typically incorporate a mixed-signal microcontroller, microprocessor or FPGA as the principal active, and sometimes sole, component. A mixed-signal microcontroller is a self-contained computer-on-a-chip consisting of a central processing unit, often with on-board non-volatile program memory for program storage, random access memory for data storage and various analog and digital input/output peripheral capabilities. In addition to the mixed-signal microcontroller, a complete embedded control system often incorporates application-specific software, various analog, mixed-signal, timing, connectivity, security and non-volatile memory components such as EEPROMs and Flash memory.\nMixed-signal microcontrollers are primarily available in 8-bit through 32-bit architectures. 8-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers remain very cost-effective and easy to use for a wide range of high-volume embedded control applications and, as a result, continue to represent a significant portion of the overall mixed-signal microcontroller market. 16-bit and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality, and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications. FPGAs are programmable integrated circuits that are used to implement complex logic functions and can be re-programmed at any time, allowing for multiple implementations and revisions during or after the customer system is manufactured. Some versions of FPGAs also include a mixed-signal microcontroller or microprocessor core to provide additional system on chip functionality to compute intensive tasks. Microprocessors integrate 32-bit (or above) central processing units (CPUs) with various high performance peripherals, such as communications and graphics, and execute code from external memory, typically dynamic random access memory.\nOur Products\nOur strategic focus is on providing cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance, extreme low power usage, wide voltage range operation, mixed-signal integration, and ease of development, thus enabling timely and cost-effective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products.\nMixed-signal Microcontrollers\nWe offer a broad family of proprietary general purpose mixed-signal microcontroller products, with significant analog and mixed-signal functionality incorporated within them, which are marketed under multiple brand names. We believe that our mixed-signal microcontroller product families provide leading function and performance characteristics in the worldwide market. We target the 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontroller and 32-bit embedded mixed-signal microprocessor markets. We also offer specialized mixed-signal microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications.\nWe leverage our circuit design, process technologies, development tools, applications knowledge, and manufacturing experiences to enable our customers to implement various embedded control functions in their end systems with our mixed-signal microcontrollers.\nAnalog\nOur analog product line consists of several families including power management, linear, mixed-signal, high voltage, thermal management, discrete diodes and MOSFETS, RF, drivers, safety, security, timing, USB, ethernet, wireless and other interface products.\nWe market and sell our analog product line into our mixed-signal microcontroller, microprocessor and FPGA customer base, and to customers who use mixed-signal microcontrollers and FPGA products from other suppliers and to customers who use other products that may not fit our traditional mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and memory products customer base.\nOther\nOur other product line includes FPGA products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and products for aerospace applications.\nOur portfolio of non-volatile FPGAs are recognized for their low power, high security and extended reliability. We market and sell our FPGA products and related solutions into a broad range of applications within the industrial, automotive, defense, aviation, space and communications markets.\nOur technology licensing business generates license fees and royalties associated with technology licenses for the use of our SuperFlash\u00ae embedded flash and other technologies. We also generate fees for engineering services related to these technologies. We license our Non-Volatile Memory technologies to foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced mixed-signal microcontroller products, gate array, RF, analog and neuromorphic compute products that require embedded non-volatile memory.\nOur memory products consist of EEPROMs, Serial Flash memories, Parallel Flash memories, Serial SRAM memories and EERAMs. Serial EEPROMs, Serial Flash memories, Serial SRAMs and EERAMs have a very low I/O pin requirement, permitting production of very small footprint devices. We sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market, complementing our mixed-signal microcontroller offerings.\nDevelopment Tools\nWe offer a comprehensive set of low-cost and easy-to-learn application development tools. These tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and microprocessor products for specific applications and, we believe, they are an important factor for facilitating design wins.\nOur family of development tools for our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and microprocessor products range from entry-level systems, which include an assembler or a compiler and programmer or in-circuit debugging hardware, to fully configured systems that provide in-circuit emulation capability. We also offer a complete suite of compilers, software code configurators and simulators. Customers moving from entry-level designs to those requiring real-time emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future mixed-signal microcontroller devices in our portfolio.\nMany independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our mixed-signal microcontroller and microprocessor product architectures, including an extensive amount of third-party tool suppliers whose products support our mixed-signal microcontroller architectures.\nWe believe that familiarity with and adoption of development tools from Microchip as well as from third-party development tool partners by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products. These development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of application-specific products from our standard mixed-signal microcontrollers.\nManufacturing\nOur manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe, assembly and test. The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry. By owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical techniques (such as statistical process control, designed experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields. Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles. This control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin. We outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of companies that outsourced all or substantial portions\nof their manufacturing. We comply with several quality systems, including: ISO9001 (2015 version), IATF16949 (2016 version), AS9100 (2016 version), and TL9000.\nRefer to \"Item 2. Properties\" for further information regarding the location and principal operations of our manufacturing facilities.\nWafer Fabrication\nFab 2 currently produces 8-inch wafers and supports various manufacturing process technologies, and predominantly utilizes our 0.25 microns to 1.0 microns processes. During fiscal 2024, we reduced wafer starts in Fab 2 to decrease production to be more in line with demand for our products. Fab 2 continues to add additional process technologies, implement process improvements, upgrade existing equipment, and add equipment to support future demand.\nFab 4 currently produces 8-inch wafers using predominantly 0.13 microns to 0.5 microns manufacturing processes.\nWhile select investments are still being made, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we paused most of our multi-year $800 million expansion and capital equipment investment plan at Fab 4. We plan to resume our expansion efforts to increase Fab 4's capacity as the business outlook improves.\nFab 5 currently manufactures discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products on 6-inch wafers. In February 2023, we announced our plan to invest $880 million over the next several years to expand our silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon production capacity, including the production of 8-inch wafers, at our Fab 5 facility. While select investments are still being made, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we paused most of our expansion activity. We plan to resume our expansion efforts as the business outlook improves.\nWe believe the combined capacity of Fab 2, Fab 4, and Fab 5 will allow us to respond to future demand for internally fabricated products with incremental capital expenditures. In light of the current macroeconomic environment, we have paused capacity expansion while continuing new technology implementation in all three facilities.\nAs a result of our prior acquisition activity, we acquired several smaller wafer fabrication facilities, which utilize older technologies that are appropriate for the discrete products they manufacture. We currently plan to continue to operate these fabrication facilities with modest investment to keep them operational.\nWe continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs. We believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive.\nWe augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a significant portion of our wafer production requirements to third-party wafer foundries, including all of our 300mm wafer requirements and some of our 200mm and 150mm specialty process technologies. In fiscal 2024, approximately 64% of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries.\nAssembly and Test\nWe perform product assembly and test at various facilities located around the world. During fiscal 2024, we increased capacity and capabilities at our Thailand and Philippines facilities to support more technologies by making process improvements, upgrading existing equipment, and adding equipment. During fiscal 2024, approximately 59% of our assembly requirements were being performed in our internal facilities and approximately 71% of our test requirements were performed in internal facilities. We use third-party assembly and test contractors for the balance of our assembly and test requirements. We plan to continue to invest in assembly and test equipment to increase our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.\nGeneral Matters Impacting Our Manufacturing Operations\nDue to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing, consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results. Our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities. Our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control, extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment. Maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results. The manufacture of integrated circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable\ncomplementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) memory and logic devices, such as those that we produce, are complex processes. These processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels.\nHistorically, we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules. In order to respond to such requirements, we have historically maintained a significant work-in-process and finished goods inventory. Refer to Note 3 for a summary of our long-lived assets, consisting of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, by geography.\nWe have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors that provide our various materials and service needs. We generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services, but, in some cases, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers.\nSales and Distribution\nGeneral\nWe market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors.\nOur direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia. We currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets. We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market. Many of our CEMs, ESEs, and sales managers have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments. We believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products. The primary mission of our ESE team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team. ESEs also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts.\nOur licensing division has dedicated sales, technology, design, product, test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees.\nFor information regarding our revenue, results of operations, and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years, refer to our financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nDistribution\nOur distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base. We believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.\nIn each of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we derived 47% of our net sales through distributors compared to 53% of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us. With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 12% and 11% of our net sales, in fiscal 2024 and in fiscal 2023, respectively, no distributor or direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales.\nGenerally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice, with the exception of orders placed under our Preferred Supply Program or otherwise designated as non-cancellable. The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.\nCompetition\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has historically been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, some of which have greater market recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. We also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied, cloned, pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such\ncountries as China and Taiwan. We are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis.\nWe currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products, including the following product characteristics:\n\u2022performance\n\u2022analog, digital and mixed-signal functionality and level of functional integration\n\u2022field programmability\n\u2022memory density\n\u2022low power consumption\n\u2022extended voltage ranges\n\u2022reliability\n\u2022security and functional safety\n\u2022packaging alternatives\n\u2022comprehensive suite of development tools\nWe believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include:\n\u2022our broad product portfolio offers a Total System Solutions through a combination of hardware, software and services\n\u2022ease of use\n\u2022functionality of application development systems\n\u2022hardware, software and tool compatibility within product families to increase migration flexibility\n\u2022dependable delivery, quality and availability\n\u2022technical and innovative service and support\n\u2022time to market\n\u2022total solution cost\n\u2022reference design\nWe believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors, but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business.\nPatents, Licenses and Trademarks\nWe maintain a portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents, expiring on various dates from 2024 through 2043. We also have numerous additional U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. We do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our semiconductor business. While our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes, we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products. As with any operating company, the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets, including our pending and existing patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Moreover, pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. Further, the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\nWe have also entered into certain in-bound and outbound intellectual property licenses and cross-licenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we and our customers from time to time receive, and may continue to receive, demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights. We diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate. In most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, however, we cannot be certain that this would be the case, or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided. Licensees of our technology may become unable to pay, and have in the past and are currently disputing their obligations to pay us royalties or fees. Litigation, arbitration or other proceedings, which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management, has been and is expected to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others. The failure to obtain necessary licenses, the necessity of engaging in defensive legal proceedings, or any negative results of these proceedings could harm our business.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe must comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our products and manufacturing processes. Our waste disposal programs in our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations. However, any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could result in an increase in capital expenditures such as acquiring costly equipment or other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure by us to adequately control the storage, use, discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities.\nIncreasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations. While we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations, technological changes, or weather, our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of, hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur Employees\nWe invest in our highly-skilled global workforce of approximately 22,300 people in accordance with our Guiding Value: employees are our greatest strength. We believe that our culture, values, and organizational development and training programs provide an inclusive work environment where our employees are empowered and engaged to deliver the best embedded control solutions to our customers.\nCulture and Core Values\nBefore Microchip went public in 1993, Microchip created a cultural framework to unite its employees through shared workplace values, and to guide employees\u2019 strategies, decisions, actions and job performance. Our culture is centered on a values-based, highly-empowered, continuous-improvement oriented approach. This corporate culture strengthens our business, and enables us to fulfill our purpose. Our focus on communication aims to provide transparency among leadership, to promote trust among employees, and is a critical part of Microchip\u2019s culture.\nOur culture is important to our employees, and is a key reason why we have a significant number of employees with long tenure with Microchip that have grown from individual contributors in the early stages of their careers into senior leadership positions today. This long tenure among our employee-base results in deep relationships and trust being built among colleagues, retention of our knowledge base, and continuation of our culture. More information on our Guiding Values can be found at www.microchip.com/en-us/about/investors/investor-information/mission-statement.\nWe promote employee adoption of our culture through a number of methods including training, mentorship, values-based performance reviews, company-wide quarterly meetings, town hall meetings with the President and Chief Executive Officer and other executive team members, and an open-door policy of communication where employees are encouraged to interact directly with management. To assess and improve employee engagement, we conduct our annual employee engagement survey, which is administered in a manner that allows employees to respond confidentially. The survey solicits feedback on a variety of factors, including engagement, culture, leadership, continuous improvement, collaboration, work environment, and ethics.\nTraining and Development\nMicrochip\u2019s culture focuses on continuous improvement. We provide training on our culture, management skills, communication, technical skills, and personal improvement. Microchip also has a leadership program that provides for the growth and development of its future leaders. This program helps us develop leaders that serve as role models of Microchip culture, and support empowerment and open communication.\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted development programs, mentoring and peer coaching, and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences. We create learning paths focused on our most common development needs and regularly upgrade our offerings to help ensure that our employees are exposed to current content. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to\nsubsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We have an employee resource group for women and one for employees from traditionally underrepresented groups in order to support readiness for future advancement.\nCompensation Programs\nWe strive to provide competitive pay and benefits, that help meet the varying needs of our employees and encourage employees to be shareholders in Microchip through our various equity incentive plans. Our total compensation package includes base pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, healthcare and retirement plans, employee stock purchase plans, paid time off and family leave. Benefit programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., and statutory pension programs outside the U.S. Microchip has multiple equity programs in place including restricted stock unit awards and employee stock purchase plans that align employee interests with those of our shareholders.\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers as of April 30, 2024:\nMr. Moorthy was appointed as Chief Executive Officer in March 2021 and to the Board of Directors in January 2021.

and\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry\nOur operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability.\nOur operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability, many of which are beyond our control. Some of the factors that may affect our operating results include:\n\u2022general economic, industry, public health or political conditions in the U.S. or internationally, including uncertain economic conditions in U.S., China and Europe, increases in interest rates, high inflation or instability in the banking sector;\n\u2022the level of order cancellations or push-outs due to uncertain economic conditions or other factors;\n\u2022disruptions in our business, our supply chain or our customers' businesses due to public health concerns (including viral outbreaks and pandemics), cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, armed conflict, war (including military conflict in the Middle East and Russia's invasion of Ukraine), worldwide oil prices and supply, fires, natural disasters or disruptions in the transportation system;\n\u2022changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers, and market fluctuations in the industries into which such products are sold;\n\u2022levels of inventories held by our customers and the customers of our distributors;\n\u2022availability of raw materials including rare earth minerals, supplies and equipment due to supply chain constraints or other factors;\n\u2022constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers' ability to ship their products, which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers;\n\u2022our ability to continue to increase our factory capacity as needed to respond to changes in customer demand;\n\u2022our ability to secure sufficient wafer foundry, assembly and testing capacity;\n\u2022trade restrictions and increase in tariffs, including those on business in China, or focused on specific companies;\n\u2022increased costs and availability of raw materials, supplies, equipment, utilities, labor, and/or subcontracted services for wafers, assembly and test;\n\u2022the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory;\n\u2022changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields;\n\u2022changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality;\n\u2022changes in tax regulations in countries in which we do business;\n\u2022new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices;\n\u2022risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\n\u2022competitive developments including pricing pressures;\n\u2022unauthorized copying of our products resulting in pricing pressure and loss of sales;\n\u2022our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce manufacturing costs;\n\u2022the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter, including the impact of product lead times;\n\u2022the level of sell-through of our products through distribution or resale;\n\u2022our ability to realize the expected benefits of our past or future acquisitions;\n\u2022fluctuations in our mix of product sales;\n\u2022announcements of other significant acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022costs and outcomes of any current or future tax audits or any litigation, investigation or claims involving intellectual property, our acquisitions, customers or other issues; and\n\u2022property damage or other losses, whether or not covered by insurance.\nPeriod-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance. In future periods, our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock. Uncertain global economic and public health conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused and may in the future cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparisons between periods less meaningful.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by the financial viability and performance of our licensees, customers, distributors, or suppliers.\nWe regularly review the financial viability and performance of our licensees, customers, distributors and suppliers. Any downturn in global or regional economic conditions, as a result of rising interest rates, high inflation, instability in the banking sector, the enactment of broad sanctions by the U.S. or other countries against Russia or China, the enactment of broad sanctions against the U.S. by other countries, public health concerns, industry work stoppages or other factors, may adversely impact their financial viability. The financial decline of a large licensee, customer, reseller or distributor, an important supplier, or a group thereof, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our inability to collect our accounts receivable balances, higher allowances for credit losses, and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Also, these parties may not comply with their contractual commitments, or may interpret them differently than we do, which could lead to termination of their performance with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, has business leverage, or favorable contractual terms, then our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's cessation of performance may be limited by their liquidity, the applicable laws, or their willingness to negotiate a resolution. In the event of such default or cessation of performance, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe have various arrangements with financial institutions for our cash deposits, and other banking activities, that subject us to risk if such institutions were to experience financial or regulatory difficulties. As a result, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and cash equivalents due to failures of financial institutions or other related parties.\nWe may lose sales if suppliers of raw materials, components or equipment fail to meet our or our customers' needs, increase prices, are impacted by increases in tariffs, or such raw materials, components or equipment become restricted or unavailable.\nOur manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards. We generally have multiple sources for these supplies, but there may be a limited number of suppliers capable of meeting our standards. We have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past, and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time to fill our orders, that they cannot fill certain orders, that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or parts, or that they are increasing prices. In particular, in fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2022, we experienced\nincreased prices at certain suppliers for certain materials required for production purposes. However in fiscal 2024, the pricing environment stabilized compared to the two prior fiscal years. An interruption of any materials or equipment sources, or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment, could harm our business. The supplies necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors increases, or due to supply chain disruptions, trade restrictions or political instability. Additionally, consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them. Also, the reduced availability of necessary labor, the application of sanctions, trade restrictions or tariffs by the U.S. or other countries or the impact of public health concerns, may adversely impact the industry supply chain. For example, in 2019, the U.S. government increased tariffs on U.S. imports with China as their country of origin. Likewise, the China government increased tariffs on China imports with U.S. as their country of origin. We have taken steps to attempt to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business. Although these increases in tariffs did not significantly increase the operating costs of our business, they did, however, adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. The additional tariffs imposed on components or equipment that we or our suppliers source from China will increase our costs and could have an adverse impact on our operating results in future periods. We may also incur increases in manufacturing costs in mitigating the impact of tariffs on our operations. This could also impair our sourcing flexibility.\nOur customers may also be adversely affected by these same issues. The labor, supplies and equipment necessary for their businesses could become more difficult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers, reduced availability of labor, consolidation in their supply chain, or sanctions, trade restrictions or tariffs or the impact of public health concerns that impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs. If our customers are not able to produce their products, then their need for our products will decrease. Such interruptions of our customers\u2019 businesses could harm our business.\nWe do not, nor have we historically, purchased significant amounts of equipment from Russia, Belarus, or Ukraine. However, the semiconductor industry, and purchasers of semiconductors, use raw materials that are sourced from these regions, such as neon, palladium, cesium, rubidium, and nickel. If we, or our direct or indirect customers, are unable to obtain the requisite raw materials or components needed to manufacture products, our ability to manufacture products, or demand for our products, may be adversely impacted. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While there has been an adverse impact on the world\u2019s palladium, neon, cesium, and rubidium supply chains, at this time, our supply chains have been able to meet our needs. While sales of our products into Russia, Belarus and Ukraine and to customers that sell into these countries, have been negatively impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at this time, we have not experienced a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial conditions. Further, because we do not support the actions of Russia against Ukraine, in March 2022 we stopped selling products to customers and distributors located in Russia and Belarus.\nAdditionally, certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues, may limit our ability to obtain materials or equipment. Although rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers' ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China or other countries.\nWe are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors, as are our SuperFlash and other licensees.\nWe rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs. Specifically, during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, approximately 64% and 63%, respectively, of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries. We also use several contractors for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products. Specifically, during fiscal 2024, approximately 41% of our assembly requirements and 29% of our test requirements were performed by third-party contractors compared to approximately 41% of our assembly requirements and 33% of our test requirements during fiscal 2023. Due to increased demand for our products, we took actions in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 to increase our capacity allocation from our wafer fabrication, assembly and test subcontractors. As product demand softened in fiscal 2024, we took actions to selectively reduce our purchases from foundries. In the event of future increases in demand, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the necessary allocation of capacity from our wafer foundries and other contractors, that any such capacity will have the ability to manufacture the process technologies that we need, or that such capacity will be available on acceptable terms. Although we are continuing to expand our internal wafer fabrication, assembly and test capacity, we expect that our reliance on third-party contractors may increase over time as our business grows, and\nany inability to secure necessary external capacity could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs our manufacturing subcontractors move to more advanced process technologies over time, we may find that they do not invest in some of the trailing edge process technologies on which a large portion of our products are manufactured. If this occurs, it may limit the amounts of net sales that we can achieve or require us to make significant investments to be able to manufacture these products in our own existing facilities, at new facilities or at other foundries and assembly and testing contractors. In August 2022, the U.S. government passed the CHIPS Act to provide billions of dollars of cash incentives and a new investment tax credit to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in our industry. We expect to receive the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capital expenditures in future periods and have applied for other incentives provided by the legislation; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such other incentives, what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be, as to which other companies will receive incentives and whether the legislation will have a positive or negative impact on our competitive position. If we do receive a CHIPS Act grant, the restrictions and operational requirements that are imposed on CHIPS Act grant recipients could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs.\nOur use of third parties reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business. Our future operating results could suffer if a significant contractor were to experience production difficulties, insufficient capacity, decreased manufacturing, reduced availability of labor, assembly and test yields, or increased costs due to disruptions such as political upheaval, infrastructure disruption or pandemics. Additionally, our future operating results could suffer if our wafer foundries and other contractors increase the prices of the products and services that they provide to us. If third parties do not timely deliver products or services in accordance with our quality standards, we may be unable to qualify alternate manufacturing sources in a timely manner or on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, these subcontractors could abandon processes that we need, or fail to adopt technologies that we desire to control costs. In such event, we could experience an interruption in production, an increase in manufacturing costs or a decline in product reliability, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Further, use of subcontractors increases the risks of misappropriation of our intellectual property.\nCertain of our SuperFlash and other technology licensees rely on wafer foundries. If our licensees experienced disruption in supply at such foundries, this would reduce the revenue from our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results.\nWe are highly dependent on foreign sales, suppliers, and operations, which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks.\nSales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales. During fiscal 2024, approximately 75% of our net sales were made to foreign customers, including 18% in China, 12% in Taiwan and 10% in Germany. During fiscal 2023, approximately 78% of our net sales were made to foreign customers, including 21% in China and 14% in Taiwan.\nA strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. Although our sales in the Chinese market were very strong in calendar 2021, competition in China is intense, and China's economic growth slowed in calendar 2022 and through the first half of calendar 2023. In fiscal 2024, economic weakness in the Chinese market adversely impacted our sales volumes in China. As discussed above, the trade relationship between the U.S. and China remains challenging, economic conditions in China remain uncertain, and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods. Additionally, over the last several years, the impact of unpredictable COVID-19 related lockdowns and the adverse impact of the rapid transmission of COVID-19 when lockdowns in China were lifted has adversely impacted Chinese customers and the supply chain. Further, increasing investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned of affiliated entities are intended to advance China's stated national policy objectives. The Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market, or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies. Weakening of foreign markets has resulted in lower demand for our products, which has adversely impacted our revenue in recent quarters and, if such conditions continue, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nWe purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers. Please see the risks related to access to raw materials, components, or equipment on page 14. In addition, we own product assembly and testing facilities, and finished goods warehouses near Bangkok, Thailand, which has experienced periods of political instability and severe flooding in the past. There can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in Thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations. We have a test facility in Calamba, Philippines. We use foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements.\nOur reliance on foreign operations, foreign suppliers, maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022economic uncertainty in the worldwide markets served by us;\n\u2022political instability, including changes in relations between China and Taiwan which could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, and subcontractors;\n\u2022social and economic instability due to public health concerns, wars, or other factors;\n\u2022trade restrictions and changes in tariffs;\n\u2022supply chain disruptions or delays;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022import and export license requirements and restrictions;\n\u2022changes in laws related to taxes, trade, environmental, health and safety, technical standards, climate change, and consumer protection;\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China, which could negatively affect the amount and timing of certain customer payments, and as a results our cash flows;\n\u2022currency fluctuations and foreign exchange regulations;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022employment regulations;\n\u2022disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents;\n\u2022disruptions in international transport or delivery;\n\u2022public health conditions (including viral outbreaks such as COVID-19); and\n\u2022difficulties in collecting receivables and longer payment cycles.\nIf any of these risks occur or are worse than we anticipate, our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer, we could face an increase in the cost of components, production delays, business interruptions, delays in obtaining export licenses, or denials of such licenses, tariffs and other restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions.\nWe depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and have limited visibility to product shipments other than orders placed under our LTSAs.\nOur net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog, and orders that are both received and shipped in the same quarter, which we call turns orders. We measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter. Historically, our ability to respond quickly to customer orders has been part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules. Shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our visibility on future shipments. Turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times. Although our backlog had been strong in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2023 and the first half of fiscal 2024, due to favorable business conditions and the impact of our Preferred Supply Program and our LTSAs, the business conditions that led us to implement the Preferred Supply Program changed and, as a result, on February 1, 2024, we discontinued the Preferred Supply Program for new orders. This change in our Preferred Supply Program does not impact our LTSAs. With the cancellation of the Preferred Supply Program, turns orders are once again key to our ability to meet our business objectives. Because turns orders can be difficult to predict, especially in times of economic volatility where customers may change order levels within the quarter, varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales. The level of turns orders has in the past and may in the future decrease in periods where customers are holding excess inventory of our products. Our customers may have increased their order levels in previous periods of tight supply to help ensure they have sufficient inventory of our products to meet their needs, or they may have been unable to sell their products at their forecasted levels which would reduce our level of turns orders. As a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries, foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders. If we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets or effectively manage our production based on changes in order forecasts, our revenue and operating results will likely suffer.\nIn February 2021, we announced our Preferred Supply Program and, starting in the first quarter of calendar 2022, we began entering into LTSAs, which offer our customers the ability to receive prioritized capacity. To participate in the original\nPreferred Supply Program, customers were expected to place 12 months of orders, which could not be cancelled or rescheduled by the customer except in the event of price increases. In August 2023, we modified our Preferred Supply Program to allow orders for six months of continuous backlog, and those orders could be cancelled or rescheduled if our planned delivery date was greater than six months from the request date. The capacity priority under the Preferred Supply Program began for shipments in July 2021, and ended upon delivery of orders that were placed under the Preferred Supply Program prior to February 1, 2024. The Preferred Supply Program and the LTSAs are not a guarantee of supply; however, they were designed to provide the highest priority for those orders which are under these programs, and the capacity priority was on a first-come, first-served basis until the available capacity was booked. A significant portion of our backlog was booked under these programs while the programs were in effect. There can be no assurance that these programs will continue to be successful or that they will provide the benefits we expect to our business. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2024, we accommodated requests by customers to push-out certain orders to help them manage inventory levels and, in some cases, to help other customers that are experiencing supply shortages. However, in the event that we decide to not accommodate a request to push out orders and customers under these programs still attempt to cancel or reschedule orders, or refuse shipment, we may have to take legal or other action to enforce the terms of the programs, and any such actions could result in damage to our customer relationships or cause us to incur significant costs. We may be unable to recover damages from customers that default under these programs. Additionally, these programs have resulted in some customers holding excess inventory of our products and thus decreased their need to place new orders, including turns orders, in recent periods.\nIntense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures, reduced sales or reduced market share.\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and faces price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. In addition, some governments, such as China, may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors, or to new entrants, and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors, including to try to disrupt the U.S. semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue, product offerings and scale. We may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022changes in demand in the markets that we serve and the overall rate of growth or contraction of such markets, including but not limited to the automotive, personal computing and consumer electronics markets;\n\u2022our ability to obtain adequate foundry and assembly and test capacity and supplies at acceptable prices;\n\u2022our ability to ramp production and increase capacity as needed, at our wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities;\n\u2022the quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use, pricing and diversity of our products;\n\u2022our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies;\n\u2022the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their applications and the success of such applications;\n\u2022the rate at which the markets that we serve redesign and change their own products;\n\u2022product introductions by our competitors;\n\u2022the number, nature and success of our competitors in a given market;\n\u2022our ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022our ability to address the needs of our customers; and\n\u2022general market and economic conditions.\nHistorically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of a product. The average selling prices of our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA products, and proprietary products in our analog product line have remained relatively constant over time, while average selling prices of our memory and non-proprietary products in our analog product line have declined over time. The overall average selling price of our products is affected by these trends; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period.\nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, modest pricing declines in certain of our proprietary product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. In the past, we have moderated average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. However, we may not be able to do so in the future. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, competitive pricing pressures on our memory and non-proprietary products in our analog product line. In fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we experienced cost increases which we were able to pass on to our customers. However, in the future, we may be unable to maintain average\nselling prices due to increased pricing pressure, including as a result of actions taken by foreign governments such as China to favor companies located in their own country, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe, and our competitors, seek to expand production capacity, increase wafer output, improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor products, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields.\nIntegrated circuit manufacturing processes are complex and sensitive to many factors, including contaminants in the manufacturing environment or materials used, the performance of our personnel and equipment, and other quality issues. As is typical in the industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels. This could include delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, and penalties for failure to meet shipment deadlines. Our operating results are adversely affected when we operate below normal capacity. In fiscal 2024, we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of $40.7 million. In fiscal 2023, we operated at or above normal capacity levels.\nWe may not be able to achieve expected returns from our planned capacity expansions.\nIn fiscal 2023, we announced our intent to expand our production capacity in the U.S. While select investments are still being made, due to weak business conditions, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we paused most of our multi-year $800 million expansion and capital equipment investment plan at Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon and paused our $880 million silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon production capacity expansion at Fab 5 in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\nThese expansion projects subject us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022availability of necessary funding, which may include external sources;\n\u2022ability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through the CHIPS Act and foreign, state, and local grants;\n\u2022increases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale;\n\u2022sufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity;\n\u2022slowing macroeconomic business conditions;\n\u2022growth in our inventories;\n\u2022ability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022potential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives;\n\u2022availability of labor, services, equipment, and construction materials;\n\u2022ability to complete construction as scheduled, and within budget; and\n\u2022availability of the necessary workforce to support the expanded capacity.\nInvestments in capital expenditures for our capacity expansion projects may not generate expected returns, or cash flows. Significant judgement is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in commencement, completion and ramping of expanded production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, or increased costs could significantly adversely impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures. Changes in laws or rulemaking in jurisdictions where we have planned expansion may cause us to reconsider the location or size of such expansion plans. For example, Regulation 27, a recently adopted rule in Colorado requires companies to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a short timeframe. Because we have contractual obligations to certain customers to assess the impact that manufacturing process changes may have on the products that we provide to such customers, we have to take a measured approach when implementing changes to our facilities, manufacturing processes, and manufacturing inputs. We have designed our Colorado expansion plan to meet the requirements of Regulation 27. Further adverse impacts to our construction projects could negatively impact our ability to reduce costs or meet customer demand. If we do receive government incentives through the CHIPS Act, or through foreign, state, and local grants, the restrictions and operational requirements that are associated with such grants could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs. With regard to the CHIPS Act, we have signed a non-binding Preliminary Memorandum of Terms to receive a grant under the CHIPS Act for modernization and expansion of our Colorado Springs, Colorado facility and expansion of our Gresham, Oregon facilities. These preliminary terms are subject to a comprehensive due diligence process and continued negotiation and\nreview and ultimately may not result in us receiving CHIPS Act funding. Our failure to conclude definitive agreements for any reason and receive final awards could make it more difficult to meet the requirements of Regulation 27, and could create a negative perception or reputational concern with respect to us and our business. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operating results are impacted by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand. Historically, since a significant portion of our revenue is from international sales and consumer markets, our business generates stronger revenues in the first half and comparatively weaker revenues in the second half of our fiscal year. However, broad fluctuations in our business, changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions (including the impact of strong demand in the industry, public health conditions or trade tensions) and our acquisition activity have had and can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality. In periods when broad fluctuations, changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur, it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonality on our business. The semiconductor industry has had significant economic downturns, characterized by diminished product demand and production over-capacity. We have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products, that cannot be quickly replaced, to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments. However, we have experienced substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results and expect, in the future, to experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions. In this regard, many of our customers felt the effects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty and customer requests to push-out or cancel backlog increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2024, and adversely impacted our revenue in recent periods. Consistent with the slowing macroeconomic environment, and the growth in our inventory, we have paused most of our factory expansion actions and reduced our planned capital investments through fiscal 2025. We are unable to predict the timing or impact of any such slowdown on our business.\nOur business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers.\nSales to distributors accounted for approximately 47% of our net sales in each of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. With the exception of certain orders placed under our original Preferred Supply Program (which has been discontinued for new orders effective February 1, 2024) and LTSAs, we do not have long-term purchase agreements with our distributors, and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice.\nFuture adverse conditions in the U.S. or global economies and labor markets or credit markets could materially impact distributor operations. Any deterioration in the financial condition, or disruption in the operations of our distributors, could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation. In addition, during an industry or economic downturn, there may be an oversupply and decrease in demand for our products, which could reduce our net sales in a given period, increase order push-outs, increase inventory returns, and cause us to carry elevated levels of inventory. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2024, we have accommodated requests by customers to push-out certain orders to help them manage inventory levels and, in some cases, to help other customers that are experiencing supply shortages. As a result of the foregoing, we have incurred charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventory, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and sanction laws, or similar laws, by our distributors could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis.\nOur future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements. The success of our new product introductions depends on various factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022effective new product selection;\n\u2022timely completion and introduction of new product designs;\n\u2022availability of skilled employees;\n\u2022procurement of licenses for intellectual property rights from third parties under commercially reasonable terms, including those that may be needed to offer interoperability between our products and third-party products;\n\u2022implementation of appropriate technical standards developed by standard setting organizations;\n\u2022timely filing and protection of intellectual property rights for new product designs;\n\u2022availability of development and support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use; and\n\u2022market acceptance of our customers' end products.\nBecause our products are complex, we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development. New products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance. We may be unable to timely design, develop and introduce competitive products, which could adversely impact our future operating results.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies. Semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant R&D expenditures. We and others in the industry have, from time to time, experienced difficulties in transitioning to advanced process technologies and have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries. Our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented.\nBusiness interruptions to our operations or those of our key vendors, licensees or customers could harm our business.\nOperations at any of our facilities, at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors, or at any of our significant vendors, licensees or customers may be disrupted due to public health concerns (including outbreaks such as COVID-19), work stoppages or reduction in available labor, power loss, insufficient water, cyber-attacks, computer network compromises, incidents of terrorism or security risk, political instability, governmental actions, telecommunications, transportation or other infrastructure failure, radioactive contamination, adverse changes in climate, or fires, earthquakes, floods, droughts, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur; however, we cannot be certain that we will avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a business interruption. For example, in the first three months of fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2022, COVID-19 related restrictions adversely impacted our manufacturing operations in the U.S., Philippines and Thailand along with our subcontractors' manufacturing operations in Malaysia, Taiwan and China. Similar challenges arose for our logistics service providers, which adversely impacted their ability to ship product to our customers. The pandemic could adversely impact our business in future periods if the impact of COVID-19 or other public health issues again becomes severe in one or more of our key markets such as China or in areas where our suppliers or manufacturing operations are located. In the future, local governments could require us to reduce production or cease operations at any of our facilities, and we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders.\nAdditionally, operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons. In April and May 2020, we received a greater number of order cancellations and requests by our customers to reschedule deliveries to future dates. Some customers requested order cancellations within our firm order window and claimed applicability of force majeure clauses due to the impact of COVID-19. Likewise, if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology, or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption, our royalty revenue may decline.\nAlso, Thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years. While our facilities in Thailand have continued to operate normally, there can be no assurance that future flooding in Thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations. If operations at any of our facilities, or our subcontractors' facilities are interrupted, we may not be able to timely shift production to other facilities, and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment. Business interruptions would likely cause delays in shipments of products to our customers, and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms. This could result in reduced revenues, cancellation of orders, or loss of customers. Although we maintain business interruption insurance, such insurance will likely not compensate us for any losses or damages, and business interruptions could significantly harm our business. For more information on adverse climate change see our risk \"Sustained adverse climate change poses risks that could harm our results of operations\" on page 34.\nOur technology licensing business exposes us to various risks.\nOur technology licensing business is based on our SuperFlash and other technologies. The success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop such technologies, to introduce new technologies, and to enforce our license terms. To be successful, any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees, provide satisfactory yield rates, address licensee and customer requirements, and perform competitively. The success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022proper identification of licensee requirements;\n\u2022timely development and introduction of new or enhanced technology;\n\u2022our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights for our licensed technology, and enforce the terms of our licenses;\n\u2022our ability to limit our liability and indemnification obligations to licensees;\n\u2022availability of development and support services to assist licensees in their design and manufacture of products;\n\u2022availability of foundry licensees with sufficient capacity to support OEM production; and\n\u2022market acceptance of our customers' end products.\nBecause our licensed technologies are complex, there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies. There can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance. Our licensees may experience disruptions in production or reduced production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive. Our technology license agreements generally include a clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages (including legal defense costs) arising from certain intellectual property matters. We could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims. We have a program to audit the royalty payments made by our licensees to help ensure that the payments are in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreements. From time to time, we or our licensees have contested the amount of royalty payments and related claims have resulted and could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management. These issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results.\nSales into governmental projects, and compliance with associated regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales are from or are derived from government agencies or customers who sell to U.S. government agencies. Such sales are subject to uncertainties regarding governmental spending levels, spending priorities, regulatory and policy changes. Future sales into U.S. government projects are subject to uncertain government appropriations and national defense policies and priorities, including the budgetary process, changes in the timing and spending priorities, the impact of any past or future government shutdowns, contract terminations or renegotiations, future sequestrations, changes in regulations that we must comply with to be eligible to accept new contracts, such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification requirements, or the impact of pandemics. For example, in fiscal 2022, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced suspensions and stop work orders for some of our subcontracts. Additionally, the amendment to the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was signed into law on December 23, 2022, and its provisions go into effect in December 2027. The NDAA amendment prohibits U.S. government agencies from buying semiconductor products or services manufactured by SMIC, YMTC, CXMT and any other entity that the U.S. government determines is owned, controlled, or connected to the government of a foreign country of concern (Prohibited Companies). Some of our products are manufactured at SMIC, and some of our suppliers buy products manufactured at YMTC. If we are unable to alternately source or manufacture certain of our products, or discontinue use of products from Prohibited Companies, if any, when the NDAA amendment goes into effect in December 2027, this could adversely impact our sales to U.S. government agencies and their prime customers. Although such actions have not yet had a material adverse impact on our business, there can be no assurance as to the future costs or implications of such actions. Sales into government projects are also subject to uncertainties related to monetary, regulatory, tax and trade policies implemented by current or future administrations or by the U.S. Congress.\nDelays, reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts, including those caused by any past or future shutdown of the U.S. federal government, could materially and adversely affect our operating results. If, in the future, the U.S. government fails to complete its annual budget process, provide for a continuing resolution to fund government operations or increase the federal debt limit, another federal government shutdown may occur, during which we may experience further delays, reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. While we generally function as a subcontractor in these type of transactions, further changes in U.S. government procurement regulations and practices, particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs or increase compliance obligations (such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification), may adversely impact the contracting environment, our ability to hire and retain employees, and our operating results.\nThe U.S. government and its contractors may terminate their contracts with us at any time. Uncertainty in government spending and termination of contracts for government related projects could have a material adverse impact on the revenue from our government related business. Our contracts with U.S. governmental agencies or prime customers require us to comply with the contract terms, and governmental regulations, particularly for our facilities, systems and personnel that service such customers. To be awarded new contracts, we may be required to meet certain levels of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certifications that we may not meet, or may choose not to meet. We are also required to have facility\nsecurity clearances to perform classified contracts and to build and sell classified products for U.S. governmental agencies. These clearances are subject to the requirements and regulations including the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual that governs the protection of classified information released or disclosed in connection with the performance of classified government contracts. Complying with these regulations, including audit requirements, requires that we devote significant resources to such matters in terms of training, personnel, information technology and facilities. The increased cost of compliance may adversely affect our operating results. Any failure to comply with these requirements and regulations may result in fines and penalties, or loss of current or future business including our ability to continue as a supplier to U.S. governmental agencies and its contractors and may materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time we receive grants from governments, agencies and research organizations, or enter into tax arrangements. If we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants or arrangements, we may not be able to receive or recognize benefits or we may be required to repay benefits, recognize related charges, or could be required to implement certain limitations on our business, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nFrom time to time, we have received, and may in the future receive, economic incentive grants, tax benefits, and allowances from national, state and local governments, agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment, production or investment at specific locations. Tax arrangements and subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive, headcount, capital and research and development expenditures and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain benefits, and these programs can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments. The CHIPS Act and its associated regulations, for example, may contain certain restrictions on grant recipient technology licensing activities and the expansion of certain facilities. Compliance with these restrictions could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs. In addition, noncompliance with the conditions of the grants or arrangements could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. We may be unable to obtain future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs, without which our cost structure would be adversely impacted. Further, any decrease in amounts received could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures.\nWe have acquired, and expect in the future to acquire, additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses. In May 2018, we acquired Microsemi, which was our largest and most complex acquisition ever. Integration of our acquisitions is complex and may be costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. We may not successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, procedures and policies. We may not realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration. There may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems. It may be difficult to develop, manufacture and market the products of a newly acquired company, or grow the business at the rate we anticipate. Following an acquisition, we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition. We may suffer loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies. We have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminated employees, stockholders of Microchip or the acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction. In particular, in connection with our Microsemi and Atmel acquisitions, we became involved with third-party claims, litigation, governmental investigations and disputes related to such businesses and transactions. Acquisitions may also result in charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs, restructuring charges, or future impairment of goodwill), contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional share-based compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results. To fund our acquisition of Microsemi, we used a significant portion of our cash balances and incurred approximately $8.10 billion of additional debt. We may fund future acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, issuing Commercial Paper, raising debt, issuing shares of our common stock, or other mechanisms.\nFurther, if we decide to divest assets or a business, it may be difficult to find or complete divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies, which may include site closures, timely or on acceptable terms. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to the desired divestiture, or the price or terms of the divestiture may be less favorable than we had anticipated. Even following a divestiture or other exit strategy, we may have certain continuing obligations to former employees, customers, vendors, landlords or other third parties. We may also have continuing liabilities related to former employees, assets or businesses. Such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to acquisitions, we have in the past, and expect in the future, to enter into joint development agreements or other strategic relationships with other companies. These transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we\nface with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction, to successfully market and sell products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions.\nAs a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets increased significantly and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangible assets.\nWhen we acquire a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. As of March 31, 2024, we had goodwill of $6.68 billion and net intangible assets of $2.78 billion. In connection with the completion of our acquisition of Microsemi in May 2018, our goodwill and intangible assets increased significantly. We review our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. Because we operate in highly competitive environments, projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results. Through March 31, 2024, we have never recorded a goodwill impairment charge. There were no material intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2024 or in fiscal 2023. If in future periods, we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control and remediate any future control deficiencies, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation with investors.\nWe have in the past identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to IT system access. Although such material weaknesses were remediated in fiscal 2020, there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identified in the future. If we cannot remediate future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner, or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, our ability to accurately record, process, and report financial information and our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in violations of applicable securities laws, stock exchange listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt agreements, subject us to litigation and investigations, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements, and adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors. In addition to the identified material weaknesses related to accounting for income taxes and to IT system access, which were remediated as of March 31, 2020, we have from time to time identified other significant deficiencies. If we fail to remediate any future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock.\nCustomer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs.\nSome of our customers require that we implement practices that are more stringent than those required by applicable laws with respect to labor requirements, the materials contained in our products, energy efficiency, environmental impact or other items. To comply with such requirements, we also require our suppliers to adopt such practices. Our suppliers may in the future refuse to implement these practices, or may charge us more for complying with them. If certain of our suppliers refuse to implement the practices, we may be forced to source from alternate suppliers. The cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability, and if we do not implement such practices, such\ncustomers may disqualify us as a supplier, resulting in decreased revenue opportunities. Developing, enforcing, and auditing customer-requested practices at our own sites and in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require more personnel.\nWe must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful, and competition for qualified personnel has intensified.\nWe must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful, and competition for qualified personnel and available labor may intensify for a variety of reasons, including the increase in work-from home arrangements brought about by COVID-19, and the wage inflation in our industry. Also, long-term labor conditions may intensify due to the expected construction of new wafer fabrication facilities by foundries and third parties in locations near our existing facilities.\nOur ability to attract and retain skilled employees such as management, technical, marketing, sales, research and development, manufacturing, and operational personnel is critical to our business. We rely on a direct labor force at our manufacturing facilities. Any inability to maintain our labor force at our facilities may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, and ultimately could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our inability to attract and retain hardware and software engineers and sales and marketing personnel, could delay the development and introduction of, and harm our ability to sell, our products. We have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team, and it is possible that they could leave with little or no notice, which could make it more difficult for us to execute our planned business strategy. Our inability to retain, attract or motivate personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of events for which we are self-insured, or which exceed our insurance limits, may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\nWe have insurance coverage related to many different types of risk; however, we self-insure for some potentially significant risks and obligations, because we believe that it is more cost effective for us to self-insure than to pay the high premium costs. The risks and exposures that we self-insure include, but are not limited to, employee health matters, certain property matters, product defects, cybersecurity matters, employment risks, environmental matters, political risks, and intellectual property matters. Should there be a loss or adverse judgment in an area for which we are self-insured, then our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Products, Privacy, Intellectual Property, and Litigation\nWe continue to be the target of attacks on our IT systems. Interruptions in and unauthorized access to our IT systems, security breaches or incidents impacting our systems or data that we or our service providers maintain or otherwise process, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the uninterrupted operation of complex IT systems and networks to operate our business. Any improper handling of confidential data, or significant disruption to our systems or networks, including, but not limited to, any that may relate to new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches or incidents, cyber-attacks, ransom-style attacks, theft or tampering, inadvertent error, facility issues, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures or energy blackouts, security breaches or incidents in our customers\u2019 or third-party providers\u2019 networks, in third-party products we use, or in cloud-based services provided to, by, or enabled by us, or any perception any of the foregoing has occurred, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations, supply chain, sales and operating results, result in regulatory inquiries, investigations or other proceedings against us, result in claims, demands and litigation against us, or damage our reputation. Such improper handling of confidential data, or system or network disruption, or any cyber-attack or other means of effectuating a security breach or incident, could result in loss, unavailability, an unauthorized release of, or other unauthorized use or processing of, personal data, or our suppliers\u2019 or our customers\u2019 intellectual property or confidential, proprietary or sensitive information. Any such matter, or any perception that it has occurred, could harm our business or competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages, and may result in regulatory investigations, inquiries or other proceedings, enforcement actions, remediation obligations, claims for damages, litigation, and fines, penalties, damages, other liabilities, and other sanctions.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience verifiable attacks on our IT systems and data, including network compromises, attempts to breach our security measures and attempts to introduce malicious software into our IT systems. For example, in fiscal 2019, we learned of an ongoing compromise of our computer networks by what is believed to be sophisticated hackers. We engaged outside legal counsel and a leading forensic investigatory firm with experience in such\nmatters. We took steps to identify malicious activity on our network including a compromise of our network and, in May 2019, we began implementing a containment plan. We routinely evaluate the effectiveness of the containment mechanisms that were implemented and continue to implement additional measures. We analyzed the information that was compromised and we do not believe that this IT system compromise has had a material adverse effect on our business or resulted in any material damage to us. As a result of the IT system compromise, our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, concluded that our internal controls related to IT system access were not effective resulting in a material weakness in our internal controls for fiscal 2019. Although this material weakness in our internal control was remediated in fiscal 2020, there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identified in future periods. Additionally, new information can develop that may impact our assessment of cyber events, including information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations.\nDue to the types of products we sell and the significant amount of sales we make to government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to U.S. government agencies, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience in the future, attacks on our IT systems and data, including attempts to breach our security, network compromises and attempts to introduce malicious software into our IT systems. Geopolitical events and tensions may increase these risks. Also, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could use AI to develop malicious code, sophisticated phishing attempts, and convincing deep fakes. A deep fake is a manipulation of our content or the voices or images of our leaders to maliciously publish false messages that appear to be authentic. Such messages may harm our reputation, which may in turn have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits, and reduce the trading price of our stock. A threat could also be introduced by our or our customers and business partners use of AI tools. The output of these tools may include threats such as introducing malicious code when AI generated source code is incorporated into products or systems. Were any future attacks to be successful, or through the unintentional introduction of security vulnerability due to AI usage, we may be unaware of the incident, its magnitude, or its effects until significant harm is done. More generally, we may face significant delays in identifying, remediating, and otherwise responding to any interruption, disruption, security breach or incident.\nIn recent years, we have regularly implemented improvements to our protective measures that have included, but have not been limited to, implementation of the following: firewalls, endpoint intrusion detection and response software, regular patches, log monitors, event correlation tools, network segmentation, routine backups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, dual factor identification, data partitioning, privileged account segregation and monitoring, routine password modifications, and an enhanced information security program including training classes and phishing exercises for employees and contractors with system access, along with tabletop exercises conducted by information security personnel. As a result of the material weakness in our internal controls resulting from the IT systems compromise in fiscal 2019, we have taken remediation actions and implemented additional controls and we are continuing to take actions to attempt to address evolving threats. However, our system improvements have not been fully effective in preventing attacks on our IT systems and data, including breaches of our security measures, and there can be no assurance that any future system improvements will be effective in preventing future cyber-attacks or disruptions, a ransom-style attack, or limiting the damage from any future cyber-attacks or disruptions. Our ability to recover from ransomware and other ransom-style attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring data from backups is delayed or not feasible. Our system improvements have resulted in increased costs to us and we may be required to dedicate additional expenditures and resources to making system improvements and otherwise addressing cybersecurity matters in the future, whether in response to any disruption, interruption, breach, incident or otherwise. Further any future improvements, attacks or disruptions could result in additional costs related to rebuilding our internal systems, defending litigation, complaints or other claims, providing notices to regulatory agencies or other third parties, responding to regulatory inquiries, actions or other proceedings, or paying damages, fines or penalties. Such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results. Furthermore, our efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations related to cybersecurity, such as the recently enacted SEC rules requiring disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident, may be costly and any actual or alleged failure to comply could result in investigations, proceedings, investor lawsuits and reputational damage.\nIn addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers, licensees, or other third parties, including state actors, have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, wrongfully use, publish, access, process or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, our technology, intellectual property, or other proprietary or confidential information. This risk would be exacerbated to the extent our competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, attempt to hire our employees. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property, and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees and certain of our consultants, who may wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors.\nThird-party service providers, such as wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, distributors, credit card processors, and other vendors have access to portions of our and our customers' data. These service providers also face significant cybersecurity threats, and they may be subject to cyber-attacks, disruptions, and interruptions to their networks and systems, and otherwise may suffer from security breaches and incidents. Any such breach or incident, including any involving misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized processing of data maintained or otherwise processed by our third-party service providers, or any perception any of these has occurred, could negatively impact our business, operations and financial results, as well as our relationship with our customers.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our cybersecurity practices or measures. We do not have insurance coverage specially for cybersecurity matters. Insurance coverage that we do have may not be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our cybersecurity practices or measures or otherwise relating to any cybersecurity breach or incident, and we cannot be sure that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.\nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.\nOur products, or IP that we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications that we implement in our products, may be subject to security vulnerabilities. And, while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect third-party content or user-generated data stored on our products, these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised, breached, or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers. Our products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity, privacy or safety risks including applications that gather and process data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and automotive applications. We, our customers, and the users of our products may not promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Additionally, new information can develop that may impact our assessment of a security vulnerability, including information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations, or become aware of additional variants or evaluate the competitiveness of products.\nSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, sales, customer relationships, share price, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available. This, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits of vulnerabilities, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation.\nWe face risks to our business and proprietary confidential information due to use of AI.\nWe limit our employees\u2019 use of third-party and open-source AI tools, such as ChatGPT, in accordance with our internal guidelines and procedures. However, the internal governance of the use of these technologies can be challenging, and our employees and consultants may use these tools on an unauthorized basis and our partners may use these tools, which poses additional risks relating to the protection of data, including the potential exposure of our proprietary confidential information to unauthorized recipients and the misuse of our or third-party intellectual property. Use of AI tools may result in allegations or claims against us related to violation of third-party intellectual property rights, unauthorized access to or use of proprietary information, failure to comply with open-source software requirements, and failure to comply with actual or asserted legal or other obligations. AI tools may also produce inaccurate responses that could lead to errors in our decision-making, product development or other business activities, which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to mitigate these risks will depend on our continued effective maintaining, training, monitoring and enforcement of appropriate guidelines and procedures governing the use of AI tools, and the results of any such use, by us or our partners.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of technologies, including new and evolving technologies such as AI, in our products may result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore\nour business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI enabling products, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the EU, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could impact us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results.\nOur failure to comply with federal, state, or international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and cybersecurity may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally regarding privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, such as the European Union\u2019s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K. equivalent to the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The scope of these laws and regulations is rapidly evolving, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Some of these laws create a broad definition of personal information, establish data privacy rights, impose data breach notification requirements, and create potentially severe statutory damages or other remedial frameworks and private rights of action for certain data breaches. Some of the laws and regulations also place restrictions on our ability to collect, store, use, transmit and process personal information and other data across our business. For example, the GDPR restricts the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. and other countries. Further, such laws and regulations have resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies such as us that have employees, customers, and operations in the EEA.\nWe have relied mainly on the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), for transfers of personal information from the EEA to the U.S. or other countries. However, the Court of Justice of the EU in a July 2020 decision (Schrems II) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield), and also called for stricter conditions in the use of the SCCs. Following the Schrems II decision, certain data protection authorities in the EU have issued statements advising companies within their jurisdiction not to transfer personal data to the U.S. under the SCCs. The EU and U.S. have established a successor framework to the Privacy Shield, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), but it already has faced a legal challenge and may face additional legal challenges. If we are unable to implement sufficient safeguards to ensure that our transfers of personal information from the EEA are lawful, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions and substantial fines and injunctions against processing personal information from the EEA. The loss of our ability to lawfully transfer personal data out of the EEA may cause reluctance or refusal by European customers to communicate with us as they are currently, and we may be required to increase our data processing capabilities in the EEA at significant expense. Additionally, other countries outside of the EEA have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency which could increase the cost and complexity of providing our products in those jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the GDPR and the U.K. equivalent of the GDPR expose us to two parallel data protection regimes in Europe, each of which potentially authorizes fines and enforcement actions for certain violations. Substantial fines may be imposed for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to 4% of a company\u2019s worldwide revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Although the U.K. data protection regime currently permits data transfers from the U.K. to the EEA and other third countries, covered by a European Commission 'adequacy decision' through the continued use of SCCs and binding corporate rules, these laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such changes could have adverse implications for our transfer of personal data from the U.K. to the EEA and other third countries. Additionally, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.\nIn the U.S., federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. For example, California has enacted the CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CPRA, which became operative January 1, 2023, expands the CCPA\u2019s requirements, including applying to personal information of business representatives and employees and establishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. Additionally, numerous other states have proposed or enacted laws addressing privacy and security, many of which impose obligations similar to those of the CCPA. The U.S. federal government\nalso is contemplating federal privacy legislation. The CCPA, CPRA, and other evolving legislation relating to privacy, data protection, and information security may impact our business activities and require us to modify our policies and practices.\nOther jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China\u2019s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China\u2019s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the U.S. could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR\u2019s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWhile we plan to continue to undertake efforts to conform to current legal and regulatory obligations and to account for relevant best practices, such efforts may be unsuccessful or result in significant costs. We may also experience reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to provide us with personal data due to the potential risk exposure of personal data transfers and the current data protection obligations imposed on them by applicable data protection laws or by certain data protection authorities. These and any other laws relating to privacy or data protection and their interpretations continue to develop and their uncertainty and inconsistency may increase the cost of compliance, cause compliance challenges, restrict our ability to offer products in certain locations in the same way that we have been, and potentially adversely affect certain third-party service providers. Further, any actual or alleged failure by us or our service providers to comply with laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity may subject us to claims, demands, and litigation, sanctions or fines by regulators, and other damages and liabilities. Any of the foregoing may harm our reputation and market position and otherwise could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, investigations or claims.\nWe are currently, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings, investigations or claims regarding intellectual property rights, product defects, breach of contracts, export controls and sanctions, and other matters. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us, our direct or indirect customers, or our licensees. These legal proceedings and claims, even if meritless, have in the past and could in the future result in unexpected and substantial costs to us. If we are unable to resolve or settle a matter, obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, reengineer products or processes to avoid infringement, provide a cost-effective remedy, or successfully prosecute or defend our position, we could incur uninsured liability in any of them, be required to take a charge to operations, be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes, suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories, incur reputational damage, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nIt is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture, performance, or use of our products. These claims may be due to injuries, economic damage, lost intellectual property, or environmental exposures related to manufacturing, a product's nonconformance to our or our customer\u2019s specifications, changes in our manufacturing processes, security vulnerabilities, or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers. We could incur significant expenses related to such matters, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022costs related to writing off the value of our inventory of nonconforming products;\n\u2022recalling nonconforming products;\n\u2022providing support services, product replacements, or modifications to products and the defense of such claims;\n\u2022diversion of resources from other projects;\n\u2022lost revenue or a delay in the recognition of revenue due to cancellation of orders, unpaid receivables, or reimbursement of costs or damages;\n\u2022customer imposed fines or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements; and\n\u2022a requirement to pay damages, penalties or recall costs.\nBecause the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell, the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may be significantly higher than the revenue and profits we received. While we\nexclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities. Further, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by law. We have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects, but we do not expect that insurance will fully protect against such claims. Payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nFurther, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive, aerospace, defense, safety, security, and medical, where failure of the application could cause damage to property or persons. We may be subject to claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. We will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products.\nOur contractual relationships with our customers expose us to risks and liabilities.\nWith the exception of orders placed under our Preferred Supply Program and LTSAs, we do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our non-distributor customers, and therefore we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers. When we enter into customer contracts (other than under our original Preferred Supply Program and LTSAs), the contracts are generally cancelable based on standard terms and conditions. Under our original Preferred Supply Program and LTSAs, customers may cancel contracts in the event of price increases. Preferred Supply Program orders placed during or after August 2023 can be cancelled or rescheduled if our planned delivery date is greater than six months from the request date. We discontinued our Preferred Supply Program for new orders effective February 1, 2024 because the business conditions that led us to implement the Preferred Supply Program had changed. This change does not impact our LTSAs. While we had approximately 123,000 customers, and our ten largest direct customers accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue in fiscal 2024, and four of our top ten direct customers are contract manufacturers that perform manufacturing services for many customers, cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits. For example, due to uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced an increase in order cancellations and requests to reschedule deliveries to future dates in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Also, many of our customers felt the effects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty, and customer requests to push-out or cancel backlog and our accommodation of their requests increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and continued in fiscal 2024.\nCertain customer contracts differ from our standard terms of sale. For some of the markets that we sell into, such as the automotive and personal computer markets, our customers may have negotiating leverage over us as a result of their market size. For example, under certain contracts we have committed to supply products on scheduled delivery dates, or extended our obligations for liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or intellectual property infringement. If we are unable to supply the customer as contractually required, the customer may incur additional production costs, lost revenues due to delays in their manufacturing schedule, or quality-related issues. We may be liable for costs and damages associated with customer claims, and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay associated legal fees. While we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions, manage the risks of such liabilities, and set caps on our liability exposure, sometimes we are unable to do so. In order to win important designs, avoid losing business to competitors, maintain existing business, or be permitted to bid on new business, we have, and may in the future, have to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement or product failure, or have to agree to liquidated damage provisions. This exposes us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products sold under such contracts, the lifetime revenues we receive under such contracts, or potential consequential damages. Further, where we do not have negotiated customer contracts, our customer's order terms may govern the transaction and contain terms unfavorable to us. These risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in competitive harm, lost revenue or market opportunities.\nOur ability to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success. To that end, we have acquired certain patents and licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes. The process of seeking patent protection can be expensive, and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications. In addition, our existing and new patents, trademarks and copyrights that are issued may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. We may be subject to, or may initiate, interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, patent offices of a foreign country or U.S. or foreign courts, which can require significant financial resources. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third-party could result in harm to our competitive position, uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us. Although we continue to aggressively defend and\nprotect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis, there can be no assurance that we will be successful.\nCertain of our software, as well as that of our customers, may be derived from \u201copen source\u201d software that is generally made available to the public by its authors. Open source software licenses impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license we customarily use to protect our intellectual property. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software, in the event that the copyright holder of any open source software were to legally establish that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work if the license is terminated which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nGovernments and courts are considering new issues in intellectual property law with respect to works created by AI technology, which could result in changing and inconsistent intellectual property rights in development processes, procedures and technologies we create with AI technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Taxation, Laws and Regulations\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the FASB and the SEC. New accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future. New accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective.\nRegulatory authorities in jurisdictions into or from which we ship our products or import supplies could issue new export controls or trade sanctions, levy fines, restrict or delay our ability to export products or import supplies, or increase costs associated with the manufacture or transfer of products.\nA significant portion of our sales involve export and import activities. Our U.S.-manufactured products or products based on U.S. technology or U.S. software are subject to laws and regulations that govern international trade, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Export Administration Regulations (EAR), International Traffic in Arms Regulations and economic embargoes or trade sanctions against certain countries and parties, including those administered by the U.S. Departments of State, Commerce, and Treasury. Licenses or license exceptions are often required for the shipment of our products to certain countries. Our inability to timely obtain a license, for any reason, including a delay in license processing due to a federal government shutdown, or changes in government policies of approval or denial of licenses, could cause a delay in scheduled shipments which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue within the quarter of a shutdown, and in following quarters depending on the extent that license processing is delayed. Further, determination by a government that we have failed to comply with trade regulations or anti-bribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges, fines, penalties, and seizure of products, or loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and earnings. A change in laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer product to previously permitted countries, customers, distributors or others. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. Commerce Department published a regulation that imposed restrictions on activities in or involving China, Hong Kong, and Macau related to advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs), advanced-node ICs, computer and other commodities that contain such ICs, certain semiconductor manufacturing items, and supercomputers. The regulation also expanded controls on transactions involving semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor equipment manufacturing end-uses. Further, this regulation expanded the scope of foreign-produced items subject to license requirements under U.S. law and added 28 entities located in China to the U.S. Commerce Department Entity List. In November 2023, the U.S. Commerce Department added restrictions and export license requirements to end uses and product categories previously described in the October 2022 regulation. In addition, the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State, and Treasury have been adding parties to the restricted parties lists, and imposing prohibitions and export licensing requirements on transactions with them. The result is that there has been a slow-down in the processing of export license applications by the U.S. Government and an increased burden on us to conduct additional due diligence imposed by the October 2022 and November 2023 regulations, as well as by sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine. At this time, there has not been a material impact on our ability to obtain necessary licenses for exportation. A previous example occurred in fiscal 2020, when the U.S. Commerce Department effectively banned U.S. companies from selling products or transferring technology to certain Chinese companies, including\nHuawei and their related companies worldwide. In fiscal 2020, the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation prohibited U.S. governmental agencies from buying equipment incorporating covered telecommunications equipment, as a substantial component or critical technology, where the technology came from certain Chinese companies. In July 2020, this was expanded to prohibit U.S. governmental agencies from entering into a contract with any company that uses covered telecommunications equipment whether or not the Chinese technology is related to the procurement. The EAR also effectively prohibits sales of items for a \u201cmilitary end use,\u201d to a \"military end-user,\" or for a \"military intelligence\" end-user, or end-use to certain countries, such as Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, Cuba, China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria and Venezuela. Any of the foregoing changes to the regulatory requirements could adversely impact our operational costs due to the administrative impacts of complying with these regulations and may limit those with whom we conduct business. Any one or more of these sanctions, future sanctions, a change in laws or regulations, or a prohibition on shipment of our products or transfer of our technology to significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods, implemented trade restrictions, and introduced national security protection policies. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, have continued to escalate from 2018 to present, and include the U.S. increasing tariffs on Chinese origin goods and China increasing tariffs on U.S. origin goods. We took steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business by adjusting our operations and supply chain. Although these tariff increases did not result in a material adverse impact on our operating costs in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2020, they did reduce demand for our products during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Increased tariffs on our customers' products could adversely impact their sales, and increased tariffs on our products in comparison to those of our competitors could each result in lower demand for our products. Further, governments may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any applications containing our products. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, and they may direct companies within China to purchase Chinese-made products. Similar restrictions on our products or the products of our customers or suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results. It is also possible that evolving U.S. export controls may encourage non-U.S. governments to request that our customers purchase from companies not subject to U.S. export controls, thereby harming our business, market position, and financial results. Excessive export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\nFurther changes in trade or national security protection policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, including those taken against the U.S. in retaliation for U.S. policies, may limit our ability to obtain equipment, components or raw materials (including rare earth minerals), limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, reduce our ability to sell products, or reduce our ability to have mergers and acquisitions approved by governmental agencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nThe outcome of future examinations of our income tax returns and existing tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to examination of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns for fiscal 2007 and later. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes of these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from current or future examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these or any future examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates, financial position and results of operations.\nIn September 2021, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (2007 to 2012 Notice) from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2012. The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2007 to 2012 Notice. In September 2023, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2016. In October 2023, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (2014 to 2015 Notice) from the IRS for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. The disputed amounts for fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2016 largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2023, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2014 to 2015 Notice.\nIn May 2023, we received a proposed income adjustment from the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (IRB) for fiscal 2020. In December 2023, we received a Notice of Assessment from the IRB asserting the same proposed income adjustment. If the adjustment is upheld by the highest court that has jurisdiction over this matter in Malaysia, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $410.0 million. The disputed amounts largely relate to the characterization of certain assets. Depending on\nthe outcome of the IRB audit, we may need to adjudicate this matter in Malaysia, and if we do, we may be required to pay the assessment and then, upon a series of favorable court rulings, request a refund of the amount. The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could commence in the next 12 months.\nThe ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS and IRB were to prevail on their assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nExposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities, changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in the interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect our effective tax rates, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including changes to our operating structure, intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies.\nOur income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period. Our future effective tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and regulations, including those that align with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Base Erosion Profit Shifting recommendations, or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted by policies implemented globally by the current or future administrations.\nThe current administration in the U.S. and administrations in other global jurisdictions in which we operate, have indicated support for significant legislative and policy changes in areas including but not limited to tax, trade, labor, and the environment. If implemented, these changes could increase our effective tax rate, decrease our revenue and increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions. Changes in tax policy, trade regulations or other matters, and any uncertainty surrounding the scope or timing of such changes, could negatively impact the stock market, and reduce the trading price of our stock. For example, in February 2022, the U.S. began implementing widescale sanctions against Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions against Belarus and certain Ukrainian regions were later implemented. Because the actions by Russia against Ukraine are in conflict with our Guiding Values, we chose to cease shipments into Russia and Belarus, and we will continue to comply with applicable U.S. sanctions regarding Ukraine. While sales of our products into these regions, and to customers that sell into these regions, have been negatively impacted, at this time, we have not experienced a material adverse impact on our revenue. Retaliatory acts by Russia in response to the sanctions could include cyber-attacks, sanctions, or other actions that could disrupt the economy. As a result of the foregoing risks or similar risks, the imposition of sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nNew technology trends, such as AI, require us to keep pace with evolving regulations and industry standards. In the U.S., the EU, and China, there are various current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and services. We expect that the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to develop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental, climate change and other regulations, which may force us to incur significant expenses and impact our operations.\nWe must comply with federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, emissions, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes, or that are the result of our manufacturing operations, such as greenhouse gases. We must also comply with rules and regulations regarding limiting greenhouse gas emissions, public reporting of environmental metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions and hazardous substances, and obtain third-party assurance of greenhouse gas reporting. Regulations could require us to change manufacturing processes, substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, obtain new permits and undertake\nother costly activities.\nOur failure to comply, or the failure of entities that we have acquired over time to have complied, with regulations could result in significant fines, litigation or administrative actions by regulators or others, liability for clean-up, criminal and civil liabilities, import/export restrictions, reduction or suspension of production, cessation of operations or future liabilities. Restrictions on emissions could result in significant costs such as the need for additional equipment, higher energy costs, carbon taxes, and emission cap and trade programs, and could also result in reduction or suspension of production, or even cessation of operations. Such regulations have required us in the past, and could require us in the future, to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations. Our failure to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could not only impact the health of our employees, customers and communities in which we operate, but could also impact our ability to operate. Such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries, require us to modify our products, shipping materials or logistics, or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses. Environmental laws continue to expand with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products and shipping materials. Future environmental regulations could require us to close or reduce production at certain facilities, reengineer certain of our existing products and may prevent us or make it more expensive for us to manufacture, sell and ship our products. For example, in Colorado, Regulation 27 requires companies operating in Colorado to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a short timeframe. Because we have contractual obligations to certain customers to assess the impact that manufacturing process changes may have on the products that we provide to such customers, we have to take a measured approach when implementing changes to our facilities, manufacturing processes, and manufacturing inputs. We have designed our Colorado expansion plan to meet the requirements of Regulation 27 and some of this plan is dependent on CHIPS Act funding. If we do not receive CHIPS Act funding, or are unable to implement the necessary abatement plan, we may be required to limit our expansion plans in Colorado, ramp down our existing operations significantly or risk noncompliance with the rule. The magnitude of the penalties that may be imposed for non-compliance is not currently known but could include significant monetary penalties and orders to reduce or cease production.\nIn March 2022, the SEC proposed a rule entitled Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors which it then adopted March 6, 2024. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC announced that it was delaying the implementation of the rule pending challenge in the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court. While the rule is not yet implemented, if it were to be implemented in its current form, we would incur significant additional costs of compliance due to the need for expanded data collection, analysis, and certification. Further, certain elements of the proposed rule, such as mandatory third-party verification of emissions, may be difficult to comply with in the proposed required timeframe as there may be an insufficient number of qualified third-party verification entities to meet demand.\nIn addition, the number and complexity of laws and customer requirements focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products, the recycling of electronic products, the reduction of chemicals used in and to manufacture electronic products, and the reduction in the amount of packing materials and the increase in the required recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly. It may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may have insufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers' needs, thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability. We may have to write off inventory if we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations. We expect these risks to continue. These requirements may increase our own costs, as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain.\nS ustained adverse climate change poses risks that could harm our results of operations.\nVoluntary actions we may take or have taken as part of our ESG initiatives could require us to limit emissions, change manufacturing processes, substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities. Voluntary restrictions on emissions could result in significant costs such as the need for additional equipment, higher energy costs, carbon taxes, and emission cap and trade programs. The cost of compliance with such voluntary efforts could restrict our manufacturing operations, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nSustained adverse changes in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us due to the effects of extreme weather and climate events on our production facilities, our supply chain and customers. Utility shortages, higher costs of utilities, and reduced availability of water could disrupt our operations as well as those of our customers and suppliers. Certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions, which some experts believe may become vulnerable to more frequent fires, storms, severe floods and droughts. While our business recovery plans are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other disruptive events, our plans may not protect us from all events.\nCustomer demands and regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, in August 2012, the SEC released investigation, and disclosure requirements regarding the use of \"conflict\" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We filed a Form SD with the SEC regarding such matters on May 17, 2024. Other countries are considering similar regulations. If we cannot certify that our supply chain is free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing, customers and others may demand that we change the sourcing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, even if the costs for compliant materials significantly increases or availability is limited. If we change materials or suppliers, there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity, delivery times and quality could be negatively impacted. Our relationships with customers, suppliers and stockholders may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing. We have incurred, and expect in the future to incur, additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We may be unable to satisfy those that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free in a materially different manner than advocated by the Responsible Minerals Initiative or the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. If we are unable to meet customer requirements, customers may disqualify us as a supplier, resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer or a reduction in purchases from us, and we may have to write off inventory if it cannot be sold.\nIn addition to concerns over \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo, our customers may require that other minerals and substances used within our supply chain be evaluated and reported on. An increase in reporting obligations will increase associated operating costs. This could have negative effects on our overall operating profits.\nFailure to meet ESG expectations, standards or disclosure requirements or achieve our corporate responsibility goals, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus on corporate responsibility matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, data privacy, cybersecurity, trade controls, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, use of products for illegal or unethical purposes, human rights, and social responsibility. We are committed to corporate responsibility and actively manage these issues including through our guiding values and our internal policies. As an example, since we do not support the actions of Russia against Ukraine, in March 2022 we stopped selling products to customers and distributors located in Russia and Belarus. However, we have been made aware that there are entities in Russia that indirectly obtained our products after March 2022 despite the preventative measures we took and continue to take. Though we continue to improve our processes and procedures to prevent the unauthorized flow of our products, our actions have not been fully successful. We operate in an extensive, ever-changing global supply chain, an expectation of complete traceability of standard semiconductor products to every end use and prevention of product misuse and diversion is unachievable. Thus, despite our efforts, our products may be used for illegal or objectionable applications and third parties may engage in conduct that we do not support or condone.\nAlso, we have publicly announced environmental goals including those related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction, achieving net zero carbon emissions and renewable energy usage, which we may refine or expand further in the future. These goals reflect our current plans and aspirations, and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. These goals could expose us to heightened scrutiny and financial, legal, reputational, operational, compliance, and other risks, including lost customer opportunities, which could negatively impact us. Further, any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders' evolving expectations could also negatively impact us.\nIn addition, we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate-related and other sustainability laws and regulations, including, for example, the state of California's new climate change disclosure requirements, the EU's new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and climate-change disclosure requirements from the SEC. Compliance with such laws and regulations, as well as the overall increased focus and scrutiny from the SEC and other regulators, investors, customers, vendors, employees, and other stakeholders concerning ESG and climate matters, could impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks, including resulting in changes to our current ESG goals.\nEvolving stakeholder expectations, voluntary and required reporting regimes that are not harmonized and continue to change, and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals, present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price. It is also possible that government, customers, investors and other stakeholders might not be satisfied with our policies, programs, goals, performance and related disclosures, or the speed of their adoption,\nimplementation and measurable success, or that we have adopted such policies, programs and commitments.\nSuch risks and uncertainties include:\n\u2022reputational harm, including damage to our relationship with customers, supplies, investors, governments, or other stakeholders;\n\u2022we may lose customers who choose not to do business with us, or we may choose to discontinue or restrict business with certain customers due to our policies;\n\u2022liabilities or penalties associated with inadequate processes to collect, audit, or disclose information;\n\u2022adverse impacts on our ability to sell and manufacture products;\n\u2022increased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action;\n\u2022unfavorable ESG ratings or investor sentiment;\n\u2022diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on ESG metrics;\n\u2022our ability to achieve our goals within announced timeframes;\n\u2022increased costs and resources to monitor, report and achieve our goals;\n\u2022unforeseen operational and technological difficulties;\n\u2022access to and increased cost of capital; and\n\u2022adverse impacts on our stock price.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations or industry standards, or achieve our corporate responsibility goals could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation, or stock price.\nRisks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets\nThe future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the recent past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. The future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022global economic and financial uncertainty due to higher interest rates, higher inflation, instability in the banking sector, public health concerns or other factors;\n\u2022quarterly variations in our operating results or the operating results of other technology companies;\n\u2022changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance;\n\u2022changes in analysts' estimates of our financial performance or buy/sell recommendations;\n\u2022general conditions in the semiconductor industry;\n\u2022the amount and timing of repurchases of shares of our common stock;\n\u2022our ability to realize the expected benefits of our completed or future acquisitions; and\n\u2022actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors.\nIn addition, the stock market has recently and in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock. The foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our Convertible Debt to decline or fluctuate substantially.\nThe amount and timing of our share repurchases may fluctuate in response to a variety of factors.\nThe amount, timing, and execution of repurchases of shares of our common stock may fluctuate based on the share price of our common stock, general business and market conditions, tax regulations impacting share repurchases and other factors including our operating results, level of cash flow, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $4.00 billion, of which $1.65 billion is still available, the authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The repurchase authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and may affect the trading price of our common stock and increase volatility.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage or refinance our current or future debt.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $6.02 billion. At March 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility which provides up to $2.75 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate in 2026, $750.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our 2025 Term Loan Facility, and $1.36 billion in outstanding principal amount of our Commercial Paper. At March 31, 2024, we had $3.20 billion in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and $710.2 million in aggregate principal of Convertible Debt outstanding.\nWith respect to such balance of Senior Notes, our 0.983% 2024 Notes in the principal amount of $1.00 billion mature on September 1, 2024, and we intend to finance the repayment of such notes using available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or our Commercial Paper program or by issuing senior notes or convertible debt. Since interest rates have increased significantly since we issued our 0.983% 2024 Notes, we expect our interest expense will increase as a result of the refinancing of such notes. Also, if we refinance such fixed rate notes with variable rate debt, changes in interest rates will have a more significant impact on our interest expense in future periods. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our current or future debt on reasonable terms, if at all.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, we may not have sufficient cash to fund payments and adverse changes in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal, interest, or to refinance our indebtedness, including our outstanding Senior Notes, Convertible Debt, and Commercial Paper, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, competitive and other factors. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases or acquisitions. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to undertake alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on onerous or highly dilutive terms. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Our Senior Notes and Commercial Paper are rated by certain major credit rating agencies. These credit ratings impact our cost of borrowing and our ability to access the capital markets and are based on our financial performance and financial metrics including debt levels. There is no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of our credit rating by a major credit rating agency could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets to refinance our existing debt or finance future debt. Our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nConversion of our Convertible Debt will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.\nThe conversion of some or all of our outstanding Convertible Debt will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of such debt. Following our irrevocable settlement election made on April 1, 2022, upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to such converted Convertible Debt by delivering cash equal to the principal amount of such converted Convertible Debt and cash and shares of common stock or any combination, at our option, with respect to any conversion value in excess thereof (i.e., the conversion spread). There would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the Convertible Debt as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash. The conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share. Any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our Convertible Debt could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Debt may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Debt could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Debt into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the value of our non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, in periods when the value of a non-U.S. currency significantly declines relative to the U.S. dollar, customers transacting in that currency may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products. In periods when the U.S. dollar declines significantly relative to the British pound, Euro, Thai baht and Taiwan dollar, the operational costs in our European and Thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected. Although our business has not been\nmaterially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, there can be no assurance as to the future impact that any weakness or strength in the U.S. dollar will have on our business or results of operations.",

    "item_1C": "Item 1C. Cybersecurity\nCyber Risk Governance\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe define cyber risk governance as a program of measures designed to protect our IT assets and information from unauthorized access, attacks or service disruptions. Our risk governance processes were designed by our IT Shared Services (ITSS) team, which maintains knowledge about the types of high-profile security breaches being reported more frequently across the globe. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of sensitive data, including confidential and other proprietary information about our business and our employees, and information belonging to our customers, suppliers, and business partners, is important to our operations and business strategy. As a result, cybersecurity and data protection are key components of our long-term business strategies.\nWe use various processes to inform our assessment, identification and management of risk from cybersecurity threats. Key areas of our cybersecurity risk management processes and strategy currently include:\nProcesses and Coordination\nWe manage cyber security and assess associated risks in these ways:\n\u2022ITSS, led by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), has first-line responsibility for our cybersecurity risk management processes, and works to coordinate efforts, priorities and oversight of cybersecurity risk;\n\u2022ITSS works with functional groups such as manufacturing, business operations, engineering, human resources, legal, and finance and is responsible for evaluating and assessing overall cybersecurity risk, and advising senior management and the Audit Committee regarding our cybersecurity risk profile and priorities as they evolve\u037e\n\u2022we have established policies and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity threats, and have integrated these processes into our overall risk management systems and processes; and\n\u2022our Internal Audit group monitors certain IT systems controls that are integrated into our larger Sarbanes-Oxley control environment.\nOngoing Evaluation and Assessment of Systems and Processes\nWe take steps to monitor evolving regulatory, industry and legal requirements and best practices relating to cyber risk mitigation, and we employ standards and frameworks that we deem appropriate to address identified risks. In addition to periodic in-depth evaluations of our applicable systems and processes, we monitor our IT systems and processes on an ongoing basis with the goal of identifying and remediating real and potential threats as they arise. We adjust our systems, procedures, and policies as we deem necessary and in response to identified threats and risks. For example, ITSS has implemented improvements to our protective measures that have included, but have not been limited to: endpoint intrusion detection and response software, vulnerability scans, regular patching of vulnerabilities, evaluating and reviewing log monitors, event correlation tools, network segmentation, system audits, data partitioning, privileged account segregation and monitoring, and tabletop exercises.\nSecurity Awareness Program to Train and Test Personnel\nWe sponsor a multi-faceted security awareness program that includes regular, mandatory trainings for our personnel on best practices for cyber-hygiene including: multifactor authentication and single sign-on use for cloud applications; ways to identify social engineering techniques, policy and process awareness, periodic phishing simulations and other preparedness testing.\nCyber Incident Response Plan\nWe maintain a cross-functional cyber incident response plan with defined roles and responsibilities and reporting protocols. This plan focuses on responding to, identifying the severity of, and recovering from a breach as well as mitigating any impact to our business. Generally, when a suspected breach is identified, the ITSS team will escalate the issue to the personnel identified in the plan for initial analysis and guidance. In the event of an actual breach, the CISO will prepare an initial assessment and consult with our general counsel (GC) and our Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Together, our GC, CFO and CISO will consult with other executives, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Operating Officer, to determine the incident\u2019s impact to our business. This management group (in consultation with outside experts) will be responsible for determining whether a particular incident (alone or in combination with other factors) triggers any public reporting or third-party notification requirements.\nRegular Evaluation of Initiatives, Results and Priorities\nThe ITSS team, in consultation with members of senior management, updates its strategy at least annually to account for changes in our business strategy, legal and regulatory developments across our geographic footprint, results of recent ITSS initiatives, and developments in the cybersecurity threat landscape. On an annual basis the CISO updates the Audit Committee (generally with all other Board members in attendance) on the performance of cyber risk key performance indicators (KPIs), cyber risks, staffing and key ITSS initiatives. On a quarterly basis the CISO updates the Audit Committee (generally with all other Board members in attendance) on the KPIs and any changes to our cyber risk mitigation efforts, and any cyber breaches that may have occurred. Feedback from the Audit Committee and senior management assists us in determining whether any further changes to our existing policies and practices are warranted. We expect that our cybersecurity risk management processes and strategy will continue to adapt as the cybersecurity threat landscape evolves. We engage third parties to assist us with our cybersecurity risk management and strategy. Some of these third parties provide us with ongoing assistance (such as threat monitoring, mitigation strategies, updates on emerging trends and developments and policy guidance) while others provide targeted assistance (such as security and forensic expertise) as needed.\nReview of Third Parties\nThere are risks associated with sharing information with third parties, and with allowing third parties to access our systems. Therefore, prior to integrating any third-party provider\u2019s information into our systems, we assess their security maturity against our standards, assess business risks associated with integration and request changes as we deem necessary.\nGovernance\nConsistent with our overall risk management governance structure, management is responsible for the day-to-day management of cybersecurity risk while our Board and its Audit Committee play an active, ongoing oversight role.\nBoard Oversight\nOur Board has delegated to its Audit Committee specific, first-line responsibility for overseeing major cybersecurity risk exposures in addition to our broader enterprise risk management program. Specifically, under its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing and monitoring enterprise risk management, privacy, cybersecurity and data security matters, including the potential impact of those exposures on Microchip\u2019s business, financial results, operations and reputation, and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate such exposures. The CISO reports at least quarterly to the Audit Committee on information security and data privacy and protection. These presentations address a wide range of topics, including trends in cyber threats and the status of initiatives designed to bolster our security systems. Our full Board is typically in attendance at these presentations made to the Audit Committee. At least annually, the Board meets with members of our senior management team to review and discuss our enterprise risk management program, including areas of material risk and how these risks, which may include cybersecurity risk, are being managed and reported to the Board and its committees.\nManagement\u2019s Role\nOur ITSS team is led by our CISO, who reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our CISO is a former CPA that has 34 years of experience in leading global accounting and business information systems groups including strategy, applications, infrastructure, information security, support, and execution.\nDigital security at Microchip is the primary responsibility of our ITSS team. Our ITSS team is responsible for infrastructure services and business continuity as it relates to digital information. The ITSS team oversees compliance with our cybersecurity framework within our Company and facilitates cybersecurity risk management activities. The ITSS team also assists with the review and approval of policies, completes benchmarking against applicable standards and oversees the security awareness training program. ITSS works to address and respond to cyber risk, including cyber risks related to security architecture and engineering, identity and access management and security operations. Collectively, ITSS has decades of relevant education and experience and maintain a wide range of industry certifications. We invest in regular, ongoing cybersecurity and architecture training for our team members.\nConclusion\nAs of March 31, 2024, we have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected Microchip, our business strategy, our results of operations or our financial condition. For a discussion of risks from cybersecurity threats that could be reasonably likely to materially affect us, please see our Risk Factors discussion under the heading, \u201cWe continue to be the target of attacks on our IT systems. Interruptions in and unauthorized access to our IT systems, and security breaches or incidents impacting our systems or data that we or our service providers maintain or otherwise process, could adversely affect our business\u201d, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update the information contained in any forward-looking statement.\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document, as well as with other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" For an overview of our business and recent trends, refer to our \"Business and Macroeconomic Environment\" discussed below.\nWe begin our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) with a discussion of our Business and Macroeconomic Environment followed by the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in the section titled \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\" Our liquidity and capital resources section generally discusses fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. For our discussion of our fiscal 2023 results compared to fiscal 2022 for both our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources sections, refer to \"Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on May 25, 2023 which is incorporated by reference herein.\nBusiness and Macroeconomic Environment\nWhile strong customer demand for our products outpaced capacity in fiscal 2023, many of our customers felt the adverse effects of slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, persistent inflation and higher interest rates in the March 2023 quarter which continued through fiscal 2024. During this period, we continued to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog resulting from customer actions to reduce inventory levels. However, beginning in the March 2024 quarter, we started seeing improvements in our business and customer requests to push out or cancel backlog started to decrease, bookings started to increase and the number of expedites and shipment pull in requests are growing. At the same time we continue to prioritize our efforts to manage our high inventory levels, and during the June 2024 quarter, we reduced production levels and implemented up to two weeks of shutdown days in our global production facilities. Consistent with the weak macroeconomic environment, most of our factory expansion activity remains paused and we have reduced our planned capital investments through fiscal 2025. We are unable to predict the timing or impact of any such slowdown on our business.\nIn response to industry capacity conditions improving and our product lead times reducing, we discontinued our Preferred Supply Program in February 2024 with respect to all new orders. We had initially launched our Preferred Supply Program in February 2021 to provide our customers with prioritized capacity when product demand in the industry significantly exceeded supply. Since the March 2022 quarter, we have been entering into LTSAs with certain of our customers for products that will be shipped in future periods. We also entered into certain LTSAs with key suppliers.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. We review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales of our semiconductor products to distributors and non-distributor customers (direct customers). We apply the following five-step approach to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction\nprice, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.\nSales of semiconductor products to our customers are governed by a purchase order, an order acknowledgment, and a distributor agreement in the case of our distributor customers. Sales to customers do not meet the definition of a contract until the customer has sent in a purchase order, we have acknowledged the order, we have deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable, and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, we offer price concessions and stock rotation rights to many of our distributors. As these are forms of variable consideration, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled using recent historical data and applying the expected value method. Generally, the transaction price associated with contracts with direct customers is set at the standalone selling price and is not variable. After the transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations, we recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. Substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with customers is recognized at, or near to, the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with distributor customers, based on our assumptions, have been materially consistent with our actual results. However, these estimates are subject to management\u2019s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results. A 100-basis point increase in the blended price concession rate would have changed the measurement of our refund liability recorded within accrued liabilities by $10.1 million.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. We record a charge to cost of sales to write down our inventory for estimated excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable. In determining whether there is a risk of excess or obsolete inventory, we evaluate projected demand over periods that align with demand forecasts used to develop manufacturing plans and inventory build decisions and write down inventory on hand that is in excess of estimated demand. Management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations. For example, demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand. Alternatively, demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued. A 1% variance in the estimated demand for our products would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately $3.2 million as of March 31, 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to record our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nVarious taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business may scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses. Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nThe accounting model related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions. The recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue. We will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period. Generally, adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement. Generally, adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition in light of changing facts and\ncircumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the closing of a statutory audit period or changes in applicable law. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process, including the complexity involved to interpret and apply tax laws, and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model, amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model.\nContingencies\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts, product liability, customer claims, governmental investigations and other matters. Additionally, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant. Consequently, we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions. We also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights, or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs. With respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims, although the outcomes are generally not determinable, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Litigation, governmental investigations and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon, and we are, from time to time, subject to such litigation, governmental investigations and disputes. As a result, no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation, governmental investigations or disputes in the future.\nWe accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our matters and, where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. Contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable, which generally is based on a probability weighted model. If fair value is not determinable, contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023:\nNet Sales\nWe operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our SuperFlash and other technologies. We sell our products to distributors and OEMs in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral. In certain circumstances, a customer's financial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided in the form of letters of credit.\nThe following table summarizes our net sales for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 (dollars in millions):\nThe decrease in net sales in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily due to adverse economic conditions, including slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, persistent inflation and higher interest rates which factors resulted in many customers having higher levels of inventory. Additionally, semiconductor industry conditions have resulted in increased costs throughout our supply chain, which we have been generally passing on to our customers in the form of price increases. Our price increases were implemented at various times and in various amounts throughout fiscal 2023 with respect to our very broad range of customers and products. These price increases contributed to the change in net sales during fiscal 2024. Due to the complexity of the implementation of the price increases and the changes in product, geographic and customer mix, we are not able to quantify the impact of the price increases on our net sales. Due to the size, complexity and diversity of our customer base, we are not able to quantify any material factor contributing to the changes in net sales. See our \"Business and Macroeconomic Environment\" discussion above for further information on our business outlook.\nOther factors that we believe contributed to changes in our reported net sales for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 and which are drivers of long-term trends in our net sales but which factors we are not able to quantify include:\n\u2022semiconductor industry conditions;\n\u2022our various new product offerings that have increased our served available market;\n\u2022customers\u2019 increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions; and\n\u2022increasing semiconductor content in our customers\u2019 products through our TSS product portfolio.\nWe sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change in our net sales in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\nNet sales by product line for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nMixed-signal Microcontrollers\nOur mixed-signal microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales. Mixed-signal microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 56.0% and 56.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\nNet sales of our mixed-signal microcontroller products decreased approximately 10.2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to adverse economic conditions, including slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, persistent inflation and higher interest rates which factors resulted in many customers having higher levels of inventory.\nHistorically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product. However, the overall average selling prices of our mixed-signal microcontroller products have increased in recent periods and have remained relatively stable over time due to the proprietary nature of these products. We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our mixed-signal microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices.\nAnalog\nOur analog product line includes analog, interface, mixed-signal and timing products. Our analog product line accounted for approximately 26.4% and 28.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\nNet sales from our analog product line decreased approximately 15.2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to adverse economic conditions, including slowing economic activity, increasing business uncertainty, persistent inflation and higher interest rates which factors resulted in many customers having higher levels of inventory.\nWe consider a majority of the products in our analog product line to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our mixed-signal microcontroller products. The non-proprietary portion of our analog product line will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products.\nOther\nOur other product line includes FPGA products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and certain products for aerospace applications. Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 17.6% and 15.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\nNet sales related to these products and services increased approximately 3.0% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The increase in net sales was primarily due to strength in our FPGA product line. Net sales of our other product line can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our FPGA products, licenses, engineering services, memory products, timing systems, and manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting).\nDistribution\nDistributors accounted for approximately 47% of our net sales in each of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 12% and 11% of our net sales in fiscal 2024 and in fiscal 2023, respectively, no other distributor or direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2024 or in fiscal 2023. Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base and that customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.\nGenerally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice. The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.\nAt March 31, 2024, our distributors maintained 41 days of inventory of our products compared to 24 days at March 31, 2023. Over the past ten fiscal years, the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 17 days and 41 days. Inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales. Due to the relatively high level of inventory days, we have accommodated efforts by our distributors to manage their inventory levels.\nSales by Geography\nSales by geography for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nAmericas sales include sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, Central America and South America. Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 75% and 78% of our net sales in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The decrease in net sales in Asia in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily due to unfavorable business conditions and weakening demand in the China market. The increase in net sales in the Americas and Europe in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was driven by our available capacity due to the weakening demand in Asia and was offset by the adverse economic conditions in the regions. Substantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar denominated. Our sales force in the Americas and Europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to Asia.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit in fiscal 2024 was $5.00 billion, or 65.4% of net sales, compared to $5.70 billion, or 67.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2023.\nThe primary reason for the decrease in gross profit of $545.3 million in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was an unfavorable net impact of sales volume, product mix and average gross profit per unit in fiscal 2024. The net impact of product mix and average gross profit per unit may fluctuate over time due to the mix of sales volumes of lower or higher margin products, changes in selling prices, and fluctuations in product costs. We are not able to separately quantify these impacts on our gross profit. The net impact to our gross profit from inventory reserve charges was an adverse impact of $58.4 million in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The gross margin impact of changes in licensing revenue, which has no associated cost of sales, was an adverse impact of $57.6 million in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The impact of unabsorbed capacity charges was an adverse impact of $40.7 million in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Unabsorbed capacity charges are expensed as incurred when we operate our manufacturing facilities below normal levels.\nOur overall inventory was $1.32 billion at March 31, 2024 and 2023. We maintained 224 days of inventory on our balance sheet at March 31, 2024 compared to 169 days of inventory at March 31, 2023. Our overall inventory level was flat as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, customer demand and inventory levels. However, our days of inventory increased significantly due to lower net sales. Our inventory amounts are impacted by timing of shipment activity in the quarter, the timing of receipt of raw materials, foundry wafers, and strategic last time buy materials and completion of finished goods.\nWe operate assembly and test facilities in Thailand, the Philippines, and other locations throughout the world. Approximately 59% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities during each of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2024, approximately 71% of our test requirements were performed in our internal facilities, compared to approximately 67% during fiscal 2023. The percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities. We believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to third-party contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process. We plan to continue to selectively invest in assembly and test equipment to increase our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.\nWe rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. During fiscal 2024, approximately 64% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries, compared to approximately 63% during fiscal 2023. This percentage may vary based on supply and demand conditions in the market.\nWe anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by capacity utilization levels, the overall mix of products sold during the period, as well as manufacturing yields, unabsorbed capacity charges, and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve. We continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expenses for fiscal 2024 were $1.10 billion, or 14.4% of net sales, compared to $1.12 billion, or 13.3% of net sales, for fiscal 2023. We are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives. R&D expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments.\nR&D expenses decreased $20.9 million, or 1.9%, for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The primary reason for the decrease in R&D expenses in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was lower employee compensation costs.\nR&D expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2024 were $734.2 million, or 9.6% of net sales, compared to $797.7 million, or 9.5% of net sales, for fiscal 2023. Our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses as well as costs related to our direct sales force, CEMs and ESEs who work remotely from sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $63.5 million, or 8.0%, for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The primary reason for the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was lower employee compensation costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2024 was $605.4 million compared to $669.9 million in fiscal 2023. The primary reason for the decrease in acquired intangible asset amortization was due to the use of accelerated amortization methods for assets placed in service in previous fiscal years.\nSpecial (Income) Charges and Other, Net\nDuring fiscal 2024, we earned special income and other, net of $12.3 million primarily due to the favorable resolution of a previously accrued unclaimed property audit matter partially offset by restructuring costs of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency. During fiscal 2023, we earned special income and other, net of $4.0 million primarily related to a favorable resolution of a previously accrued legal matter partially offset by restructuring costs of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency. Restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 include $6.2 million and $16.8 million, respectively, related to the restructuring of our wafer fabrication operations.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest income in fiscal 2024 was $7.6 million compared to $2.1 million in fiscal 2023.\nInterest expense in fiscal 2024 was $198.3 million compared to $203.9 million in fiscal 2023. The primary reason for the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 is due to the cumulative pay down of our debt offset by higher interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt.\nLoss on settlement of debt in fiscal 2024 was $12.2 million compared to $8.3 million in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2024 and in fiscal 2023, the losses related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding Convertible Debt.\nOther loss, net, in fiscal 2024 was $2.2 million compared to other income, net of $3.8 million in fiscal 2023. The primary reason for the change in other (loss) income, net during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 relates to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes is attributable to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, decreased over the same period last year as a result of changes in tax laws and changes to the valuation allowance established for certain deferred tax assets.\nOur effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 includes a $69.8 million tax benefit received from current year generated R&D credits,\nwhich reduced our effective tax rate by 3.0%; and a $62.9 million tax expense for the effects of foreign operations, which increased our effective tax rate by 2.7%.\nOur effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 includes a $63.8 million tax benefit received from R&D credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 2.2%; an $11.4 million tax benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective\ntax rate by 0.4%; a $50.6 million tax expense related to changes in various tax reserves, which increased our effective tax rate by 1.7%; and a $258.9 million tax expense for the effects of foreign operations, which increased our effective tax rate by 8.9%.\nWe are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations. The effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than our combined U.S. federal and state effective tax rate. Our domestic blended statutory tax rate in each of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 was approximately 22%. Our non-U.S. blended statutory tax rates in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 were lower than this amount. The difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, tax holidays, financing arrangements and other factors. Our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses.\nOur foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations in Malta taxed at a 5.0% statutory tax rate and Ireland taxed at a 12.5% statutory tax rate. Additionally, our Thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property, plant, and equipment in Thailand. Our tax holiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays, otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20.0%. We do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nIn September 2021, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (2007 to 2012 Notice) from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2012. The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2007 to 2012 Notice.\nIn September 2023, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2016. In October 2023, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (2014 to 2015 Notice) from the IRS for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. The disputed amounts for fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2016 largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2023, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2014 to 2015 Notice.\nIn May 2023, we received a proposed income adjustment from the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (IRB) for fiscal 2020. In December 2023, we received a Notice of Assessment from the IRB asserting the same proposed income adjustment. If the adjustment is upheld by the highest court that has jurisdiction over this matter in Malaysia, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $410.0 million. The disputed amounts largely relate to the characterization of certain assets. Depending on the outcome of the IRB audit, we may need to adjudicate this matter in Malaysia, and if we do, we may be required to pay the assessment and then, upon a series of favorable court rulings, request a refund of the amount. The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could commence in the next 12 months.\nWe firmly believe that the assessments described above are without merit and plan to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve these matters. We intend to vigorously defend our positions and we are confident in our ability to prevail on the merits. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as these to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves. The ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS and IRB were to prevail on their assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nVarious taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses. Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. For U.S. federal, and in general for U.S. state tax returns, our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities. We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) of 15.0% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.00 billion over a three-year period, as well as a 1% excise tax on the net fair market value of stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The Corporate AMT is effective beginning in fiscal 2024. The Inflation Reduction Act did not have a material impact on our tax expense, cash taxes, or effective tax rate for the years ending March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2024, 27 countries have enacted various aspects of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project to ensure that multinational enterprises pay a GMT. In 24 of those countries, the GMT is effective for tax years beginning in our fiscal 2025. Based on currently enacted law, the impact of GMT on the fiscal 2025 results is not expected to be material.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had $319.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2024, an increase of $85.7 million from the March 31, 2023 balance.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.89 billion in fiscal 2024 primarily due to net income of $1.91 billion, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.06 billion and net cash outflows of $76.7 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal 2024 include a decrease in accounts payable due to lower spending in adverse economic conditions, decreases in accrued liabilities driven by lower accruals related to employee compensation offset by higher deferred revenue and sales related reserves, increases in other assets driven by payments for manufacturing supply capacity reservation commitments offset by increases in other liabilities due to cash collected from customers under our LTSAs, and a decrease in income tax payable, offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable driven primarily by reduced revenue and timing of shipments and collections, and a decrease in inventories related to our efforts to balance manufacturing production, customer demand and inventory levels. The cash collected from these LTSAs is refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments. In future periods, we expect cash inflows under these LTSAs to decrease, and cash outflows to increase as amounts are refunded to customers (see \"Note 2. Net Sales\" to our consolidated financial statements). Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.62 billion in fiscal 2023 primarily due to net income of $2.24 billion, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.40 billion and net cash outflows of $16.0 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $392.1 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $599.5 million for fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 investing cash flows primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets.\nOur level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. Capital expenditures were $285.1 million and $486.2 million in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment. Consistent with the slowing macroeconomic environment which began in the March 2023 quarter, we have paused most of our factory expansion actions and reduced our planned capital investments for fiscal 2025. We currently intend to invest about $175 million in equipment and facilities during the next 12 months. We believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations. In February 2023, we announced our plan to invest $880 million over the next several years to expand our SiC and silicon production capacity, including the production of 8-inch wafers, at our Fab 5 facility. While select investments are still being made, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we paused most of our expansion activity. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS Act which is to provide billions of dollars of cash incentives and a new investment tax credit to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in our industry. In December 2023, we reached a Preliminary Memorandum of Terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce for $162 million in CHIPS Act grants for two of our U.S. wafer fabrication facilities. These preliminary terms are subject to a comprehensive due diligence process and continued negotiation and review and there can be no assurance that the grants will receive final approval. If we do receive a CHIPS Act grant, the restrictions and operational requirements that are imposed on CHIPS Act grant recipients could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs. We expect to receive the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capital expenditures in future periods and expect to apply for other incentives provided by the legislation; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such other incentives, what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be, as to which other companies will receive incentives and whether the legislation will have a positive or negative impact on our competitive position.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $2.41 billion for fiscal 2024 compared to $3.10 billion for fiscal 2023. Significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows included:\n\u2022in fiscal 2024, $537.7 million of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, our 4.333% 2023 Notes, our 2.670% 2023 Notes, our 0.972% 2024 Notes, and our Revolving Credit Facility, partially funded by proceeds from borrowings on our 2025 Term Loan Facility, proceeds from the issuance of our Commercial Paper, and proceeds from the issuance of our 5.050% 2029 Notes, and\n\u2022in fiscal 2023, $1.47 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, and our Revolving Credit Facility, and\n\u2022in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of $911.5 million and $695.3 million, respectively, and\n\u2022in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we repurchased shares of our common stock for $982.1 million and $945.8 million, respectively.\nIn August 2023, our amended and restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2021, was amended by the first incremental term loan amendment, dated as of August 31, 2023. Pursuant to this amendment, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million under the new 2025 Term Loan Facility bearing interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, plus a margin of 1.125% to 1.5%, or Alternate Base Rate, plus a margin of 0.125% to 0.5%, with a maturity date of August 31, 2025. The interest rate margins are determined based on our credit ratings. In September 2023, we established a Commercial Paper program under which we may issue short-term unsecured promissory notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $2.75 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The Commercial Paper is sold from time to time at a discount from par or alternatively, sold at par and bears interest rates that will vary based on market conditions and the time of issuance. The outstanding Commercial Paper balance will reduce the amounts that would otherwise be available to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2024, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $6.02 billion. At March 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility compared to $100.0 million at March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2024, we had $1.36 billion in outstanding principal amount of Commercial Paper.\nCapital Returns\nIn November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In fiscal 2024, we repurchased approximately 11.9 million shares of our common stock for $982.1 million under this authorization. In fiscal 2023, we repurchased approximately 12.9 million shares of our common stock for $945.8 million under this authorization. As of March 31, 2024, approximately $1.65 billion remained available for repurchases under the program. As of March 31, 2024, we held approximately 41.1 million shares as treasury shares. Our current intent is to regularly repurchase shares of our common stock over time based on our cash generation, leverage metrics, and market conditions.\nIn October 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. To date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $6.65 billion. Cash dividends paid per share were $1.682 and $1.263 during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. Total dividend payments amounted to $911.5 million and $695.3 million during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. A quarterly dividend of $0.452 per share was declared on May 6, 2024 and will be paid on June 5, 2024 to stockholders of record as of May 22, 2024. We expect the aggregate cash dividend for the June 2024 quarter to be approximately $243.0 million. Our Board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Our current intent is to increase our quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations, and potential changes in tax laws.\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and our 2025 Term Loan Facility, and proceeds from issuance of our Commercial Paper will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from working capital requirements, interest and principal repayments related to our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, cash dividends, share repurchases, and income tax payments. For additional information regarding our cash requirements see \"Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies\", \"Note 9. Leases\", \"Note 5. Debt\" and \"Note\n11. Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements. The semiconductor industry is capital intensive and in order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development and to expand our existing facilities or potentially construct new facilities. We may increase our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or our Commercial Paper program or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to refinance our existing debt, maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes. The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the maturity dates of our existing debt, our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash, demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates. We plan to refinance certain of our existing notes as they mature and we may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our other outstanding debt or Convertible Debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt, term loans, Commercial Paper, tender offers, exchange transactions or open market repurchases. Such issuances, tender offers or exchanges or purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors. There can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to uncertainties resulting from rising interest rates, higher inflation, economic uncertainty, instability in the banking sector, public health concerns, or other factors, and any additional equity financing or convertible debt financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders. We are also pursuing incentives under the CHIPS Act to increase our domestic manufacturing capacity; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such incentives or what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be.\nSummarized Financial Information\nThe tables below present the summarized financial information on a combined basis for Microchip Technology Incorporated and the following subsidiaries of Microchip Technology Incorporated that provide guarantees of our Senior Notes: Atmel Corporation, Microchip Holding Corporation, Microchip Technology LLC, Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., Microsemi Corporation, and Microsemi Storage Solutions, Inc. (such subsidiaries collectively, the Subsidiary Obligors). The debt securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the aforementioned subsidiaries and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The summarized financial information is provided in accordance with the reporting requirements of Rule 13-01 under Regulation S-X and is not intended to present our financial position or results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as such principles are in effect in the U.S.\nWe have presented summarized financial information below for Microchip Technology Incorporated and the Subsidiary Obligors after the elimination of intercompany transactions and balances among Microchip Technology Incorporated and the Subsidiary Obligors and investments in any subsidiaries (in millions). The Subsidiary Obligors regularly sell goods and services to non-guarantor subsidiaries (Non-Guarantors) and the Subsidiary Obligors regularly purchase goods and services from Non-Guarantor through intercompany arrangements.

    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of March 31, 2024, our current and long-term debt totaled $6.02 billion. We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $5.27 billion as of March 31, 2024. We have interest rate exposure with respect to the $750.0 million of our variable interest rate debt outstanding under our 2025 Term Loan Facility, as of March 31, 2024. A 50-basis point increase in interest rates would increase our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $3.8 million. We intend to finance the repayment of a portion of our fixed rate debt maturing within the next 12 months using available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, new fixed rate notes, term loans, convertible debt, Commercial Paper or other instruments at which point, changes in interest rates will have a more significant impact on our interest expense if we refinance such fixed rate debt with variable rate debt. For additional information, refer to \"Note 5. Debt\" for a summary of our debt obligations by maturity date.\nInflation Risk\nInflation has not had a material adverse impact on our operating results in recent periods. However, if our costs were to continue to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to continue to offset such higher costs through price increases which could adversely impact our operating results.",

Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we\nfile or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management. Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met.\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's assessment included an evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by our finance organization.\nBased on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
