    "item_1": "Item 1.\nBUSINESS\nAmgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as \u201cAmgen,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.\nAmgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people\u2019s lives. A biotechnology pioneer, Amgen has grown to be one of the world\u2019s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.\nAmgen was incorporated in California in 1980 and became a Delaware corporation in 1987. We have a presence in approximately 100 countries worldwide. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics.\nSignificant Developments\nFollowing is a summary of significant developments affecting our business that have occurred and that we have reported since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProducts/Pipeline\nOncology/Hematology\nKANJINTITM* (trastuzumab-anns)\n\u2022\nIn June 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KANJINTITM for all approved indications of the reference product Herceptin\u00ae (trastuzumab) for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer and HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In July 2019, we and Allergan plc (Allergan) launched KANJINTITM in the United States.\nFor a discussion of litigation related to KANJINTITM, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nKYPROLIS\u00ae (carfilzomib)\n\u2022\nIn September 2019, we announced that the phase 3 CANDOR (Carfilzomib, Daratumumab and Dexamethasone for Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma) study evaluating KYPROLIS\u00ae in combination with dexamethasone and DARZALEX\u00ae (daratumumab) compared to KYPROLIS\u00ae and dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).\n\u2022\nIn January 2020, a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) was submitted to the FDA to expand the Prescribing Information to include KYPROLIS\u00ae in combination with dexamethasone and DARZALEX\u00ae for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma based on data from the phase 3 CANDOR study.\n\u2022\nIn January 2020, our Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) was accepted by the China National Medical Products Administration for the use of KYPROLIS\u00ae and dexamethasone for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\nMVASITM* (bevacizumab-awwb)\n\u2022\nIn July 2019, we and Allergan launched MVASITM in the United States.\nFor a discussion of litigation related to MVASITM, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n* Registered in the United States.\nCollaboration with BeiGene, Ltd.\n\u2022\nIn January 2020, we entered into a strategic collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) to support our oncology pipeline and expand our oncology presence in China. As part of the agreement we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene for $2.8 billion in cash.\nAMG 510\n\u2022\nIn October 2019, the FDA granted AMG 510 fast track designation for the treatment of patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) G12C mutation. AMG 510 is a small molecule inhibitor of KRAS G12C.\nABP 798 (biosimilar rituximab)\n\u2022\nIn August 2019, we and Allergan announced positive top-line results from a comparative clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 798, a biosimilar candidate to Rituxan\u00ae (rituximab), compared to Rituxan\u00ae in patients with CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The primary endpoint, an assessment of overall response rate by week 28, was within the prespecified margin for ABP 798 compared to Rituxan\u00ae, showing clinical equivalence. Safety and immunogenicity of ABP 798 were comparable to Rituxan\u00ae.\n\u2022\nIn December 2019, we and Allergan submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for ABP 798.\nCardiovascular\nRepatha\u00ae (evolocumab)\n\u2022\nIn August 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware overturned a unanimous jury verdict upholding the validity of two of our patents related to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibodies in our infringement action against Sanofi, Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, Aventisub LLC and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInflammation\nAVSOLATM (infliximab-axxq/formerly ABP 710)\n\u2022\nIn December 2019, the FDA approved AVSOLATM for all approved indications of the reference product REMICADE\u00ae (infliximab).\nEnbrel\u00ae (etanercept)\n\u2022\nIn August 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled in Amgen\u2019s favor on validity of the two patents that describe and claim ENBREL and methods for making it. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisition of Otezla\u00ae (apremilast)\n\u2022\nIn November 2019, we completed our acquisition of the worldwide rights to Otezla\u00ae, the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis from Celgene Corporation (Celgene). Otezla\u00ae, along with certain related assets and liabilities, was acquired for $13.4 billion in cash.\nBone health\nEVENITY\u00ae (romosozumab-aqqg)\n\u2022\nIn April 2019, the FDA approved EVENITY\u00ae for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture.\n\u2022\nIn December 2019, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for EVENITY\u00ae for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture.\nNeuroscience\nAMG 520/CNP520\n\u2022\nIn July 2019, we and Novartis AG (Novartis) discontinued investigating AMG 520/CNP520, a small molecule inhibitor of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE), for the prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products\nThe largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces is based in the United States and Europe. In addition, we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories, including parts of Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. This expansion is occurring by establishing our own affiliates, by acquiring existing third-party businesses or product rights or by partnering with third parties. Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third party\u2019s varies across these markets. Such use typically depends on several factors, including the nature of entry into the new market, the size of an opportunity and operational capabilities. Together with our partners, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.\nIn the United States, we sell primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, which are the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products through direct-to-consumer channels, including print, television and online media. For further discussion, see Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country.\nOur product sales to three large wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years 2019, 2018 and 2017. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for 81%, 84% and 81% of worldwide gross revenues for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit or obtaining credit insurance.\nOur products are marketed around the world, with the United States being our largest market. The following chart shows our product sales by principal product and by geography for the years 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nEnbrel\u00ae (etanercept)\nWe market ENBREL, a tumor necrosis factor blocker, primarily in the United States. ENBREL was launched in 1998 and is used primarily in indications for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and patients with active psoriatic arthritis.\nNeulasta\u00ae (pegfilgrastim)\nWe market Neulasta\u00ae, a pegylated protein based on the filgrastim molecule, primarily in the United States and Europe. Neulasta\u00ae was launched in 2002 and is used primarily in the indication to help reduce the chance of infection due to a low white blood cell count in patients with certain types of cancer (nonmyeloid) who receive anticancer medicines (chemotherapy) that can cause fever and a low blood cell count. In 2015, the Neulasta\u00ae Onpro\u00ae kit became available in the United States. The Neulasta\u00ae Onpro\u00ae kit provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of Neulasta\u00ae on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery of the recommended dose of Neulasta\u00ae at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor.\nProlia\u00ae (denosumab)\nWe market Prolia\u00ae primarily in the United States and Europe. Prolia\u00ae contains the same active ingredient as XGEVA\u00ae (denosumab) but is approved for different indications, patient populations, doses and frequencies of administration. Prolia\u00ae was launched in the United States and Europe in 2010. In the United States, it is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In Europe, Prolia\u00ae is used primarily for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture.\nXGEVA\u00ae\nWe market XGEVA\u00ae primarily in the United States and Europe. XGEVA\u00ae was launched in the United States in 2010 and is now used primarily in the indication for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and multiple myeloma. XGEVA\u00ae was launched in Europe in 2011 and is used primarily in the indication for the prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. It was approved in January 2018 in the United States and in April 2018 in Europe for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma.\nAranesp\u00ae (darbepoetin alfa)\nWe market Aranesp\u00ae primarily in the United States and Europe. It was launched in 2001 and is indicated to treat a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) (in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis). Aranesp\u00ae is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy in certain patients with nonmyeloid malignancies and when chemotherapy will be used for at least two months after starting Aranesp\u00ae.\nKYPROLIS\u00ae (carfilzomib)\nWe market KYPROLIS\u00ae primarily in the United States and Europe. KYPROLIS\u00ae was launched in 2012 and is indicated in combination with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. It is also approved as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more previous therapies. In September 2019, the CANDOR phase 3 study of KYPROLIS\u00ae in combination with dexamethasone and DARZALEX\u00ae met its primary endpoint of PFS in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. FDA approval of KYPROLIS\u00ae in combination with dexamethasone and DARZALEX\u00ae is expected in 2020.\nEPOGEN\u00ae (epoetin alfa)\nWe market EPOGEN\u00ae in the United States for dialysis patients. EPOGEN\u00ae was launched in 1989, and we market it for the indication to treat anemia caused by CKD in patients on dialysis in order to lessen the need for red blood cell transfusions. The majority of our sales are to a large dialysis provider.\nSensipar\u00ae/Mimpara\u00ae (cinacalcet)\nWe market cinacalcet as Sensipar\u00ae primarily in the United States and as Mimpara\u00ae primarily in Europe. It was launched in 2004 and is used primarily in the indication for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients with CKD who are on dialysis.\nOther Marketed Products\nWe also market a number of other products in various markets worldwide, including Nplate\u00ae (romiplostim), Vectibix\u00ae (panitumumab), Repatha\u00ae (evolocumab), Parsabiv\u00ae (etelcalcetide), BLINCYTO\u00ae (blinatumomab), Aimovig\u00ae (erenumab-aooe), NEUPOGEN\u00ae (filgrastim), Otezla\u00ae (apremilast), AMGEVITATM (adalimumab), KANJINTITM (trastuzumab), EVENITY\u00ae (romosozumab-aqqg), IMLYGIC\u00ae (talimogene laherparepvec), MVASITM (bevacizumab-awwb) and Corlanor\u00ae (ivabradine).\nOtezla\u00ae\nIn November 2019, we began to market Otezla\u00ae upon the closing of our acquisition. Otezla\u00ae is used primarily for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis for whom phototherapy or systemic therapy is appropriate.\nPatents\nThe following table lists our outstanding material patents for the indicated product by territory, general subject matter and latest expiry date. Certain of the European patents are the subjects of supplemental protection certificates that provide additional protection for the products in certain European countries beyond the dates listed in the table. See footnotes to the patent table below.\nOne or more patents with the same or earlier expiry dates may fall under the same general subject matter and are not listed separately.\nCGRP = calcitonin gene-related peptide, RANKL = receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand\n(1)\nA European patent with this subject matter may also be entitled to supplemental protection in one or more countries in Europe, and the length of any such extension will vary by country. For example, supplementary protection certificates have been issued related to the indicated products for patents in at least the following countries:\n\u2022denosumab - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2025\n\u2022cinacalcet - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2020\n\u2022carfilzomib - France, Germany, Italy and Spain, expiring in 2030\n\u2022romiplostim - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2024\n\u2022panitumumab - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2022\n\u2022evolocumab - France and Spain, expiring in 2030\n\u2022etelcalcetide - France and Italy, expiring in 2031\n\u2022blinatumomab - France, Italy and Spain, expiring in 2029\n\u2022erenumab - France, Italy and Spain, expiring in 2033\n\u2022talimogene laherparepvec - Spain, expiring in 2026; France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, expiring in 2027\n\u2022apremilast - Italy, expiring in 2028\n(2)\nA patent with this subject matter may be entitled to patent term extension in the United States.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. A number of our marketed products are indicated in disease areas in which other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through research and development (R&D) activities. Additionally, some competitor-marketed products target the same genetic pathways as our recently launched marketed products or are being pursued currently. This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products. We continue to pursue ways to increase the value of our medicines through innovations during their life cycles, which can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly. Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation. For example, we market the Neulasta\u00ae Onpro\u00ae kit, which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta\u00ae on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor. We also market the AutoTouch\u00ae reusable auto-injector to be used with Enbrel Mini\u00ae single-dose prefilled cartridges (50 mg/mL). The Enbrel Mini\u00ae utilizes a drug formulation of ENBREL that was associated with statistically significant lower-mean-injection site pain than the current formulation. We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position. Such position may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience, delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration.\nCertain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired, and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars and generics. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is \u201chighly similar\u201d to the original reference product. We expect that the adverse impact on our originator product sales from biosimilar competition will reflect current trends and actual results given similar conditions. We also believe that when multiple biosimilar versions of one of our originator products get approved and launched, competition could intensify more rapidly, leading to net price declines for both reference and biosimilar products, resulting in a greater impact on our products\u2019 sales. We have seen biosimilar markets evolve differently across our major markets. For example, biosimilar adoption rates tend to be faster in the European Union (EU) than in the United States. In the United States, companies now have launched biosimilar versions of EPOGEN\u00ae, NEUPOGEN\u00ae and Neulasta\u00ae and have approved biosimilars for ENBREL. See also Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Approval of Biosimilars. Although we expect competitor biosimilars to compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, reliability and safety of our products. As additional biosimilar competitors come to market, we will leverage our global experience versus both branded and biosimilar competition.\nWe also have our own biosimilar products in the United States and outside the U.S. markets that are competing against branded and biosimilar versions of our competitors\u2019 products. In 2019, Amgen, in collaboration with Allergan, launched in the United States MVASITM, a biosimilar to Avastin\u00ae (bevacizumab), and KANJINTITM, a biosimilar to Herceptin\u00ae (trastuzumab). We have also received FDA approval for AMJEVITATM (adalimumab-atto), a biosimilar to Humira\u00ae (adalimumab), and\nAVSOLATM(infliximab-axxq), a biosimilar to Remicade\u00ae (infliximab). We expect additional biosimilar competition to both our branded and biosimilar products in the future across all markets.\nIn addition, although most of our products are biologics, some of our products are small molecule products. Because the FDA approval process allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than having to conduct their own costly and time-consuming clinical trials, generic manufacturers can often develop and market their competing versions of our small molecule products at much lower prices. As a result, upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a small molecule product, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time.\nThe introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result (i) in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents or (ii) in reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. (As used in this document, the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies.) See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our products face substantial competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors-We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.\nThe following table reflects our significant competitors and is not exhaustive.\n* Approved biosimilars available.\n(1)\nA subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n(2)\nDermatology only.\n(3)\nOther biosimilars under regulatory review in the United States and Europe.\n(4)\nPROCRIT\u00ae competes with Aranesp\u00ae in supportive cancer care and predialysis settings.\n(5)\nMIRCERA\u00ae competes with Aranesp\u00ae only in the nephrology segment.\n(6)\nOur U.S. composition-of-matter patent for Sensipar\u00ae expired in March 2018. We are engaged in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar\u00ae surrounding our U.S. formulation patent that expires in September 2026. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information. Several of these generic versions of Sensipar\u00ae have been approved by the FDA.\n(7)\nA subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.\n(8)\nA subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.\n(9)\nKYPROLIS\u00ae is facing increased competition from several recently approved products.\n(10)\nA subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS).\nReimbursement\nSales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare, and their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs and economic challenges. Drugs remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefits such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. These pressures are intensified where our products are subject to competition, including from biosimilars.\nIn the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private payer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We provide negotiated rebates to healthcare providers, private payers, government payers and PBMs. In addition, we are required to (i) provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program.\nBoth private and government payers utilize formularies to manage access and utilization of drugs. A drug\u2019s inclusion and favorable positioning on formulary is essential to ensure patients have access to a particular drug. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions due to economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients\u2019 use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug, higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion, which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Furthermore, over the past few years, PBMs and insurers have consolidated, resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as with ENBREL, Otezla, Repatha\u00ae and Aimovig\u00ae, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order to gain and/or maintain their formulary position.\nIn addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers from both major U.S. political parties are pursuing policies to lower drug costs. Potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing importation of drugs from other countries, creating an International Pricing Index, which would set the prices of certain drugs based on those available in other countries, establishing caps on price increases based on inflation metrics, increasing greater transparency on drug pricing and utilizing third party value assessments to determine drug prices. For example, in December 2019, a drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3, passed the U.S. House of Representatives, which would, among other things, enable direct price negotiations by the federal government on certain drugs (with the maximum price paid by Medicare capped based on an international price index), include a penalty for failing to reach agreement with the government and require that manufacturers offer these negotiated prices to other payers. It also would penalize manufacturers for raising prices on drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and D faster than the rate of inflation and make other changes to the structure of Medicare Part D benefit design. The path forward on drug-pricing policy reforms remains unclear from both a congressional and administrative perspective despite all of the activity in 2019. Deliberations are continuing into 2020.\nIn many countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in mandates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies; and these organizations are expanding in established and emerging markets. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than our product label or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies.\nThe dynamics and developments discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products and the industry. Given the diverse interests in play between payers, biopharmaceutical manufacturers, policy makers, healthcare providers and independent organizations, if and whether the parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remains unclear and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:\n\u2022\ninvesting billions of dollars annually in R&D;\n\u2022\ndeveloping more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably-supplied biosimilars;\n\u2022\npricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;\n\u2022\npartnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;\n\u2022\nproviding patient support and education programs;\n\u2022\nhelping patients in financial need access our medicines; and\n\u2022\nworking with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.\nManufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials\nManufacturing\nWe believe we are a leader in the manufacturing of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally-occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Further, our expertise in manufacturing of biologics positions us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties.\nOur internal manufacturing network has the commercial production capabilities of bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, finish, tableting and device assembly. These activities are performed within the United States and its territories in our Puerto Rico, Rhode Island and California facilities as well as internationally in our Ireland, Netherlands and Singapore facilities. In addition, we utilize third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network.\nTo support our clinical trials, we manufacture product candidates primarily at our California facilities. We also utilize third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our overall clinical manufacturing network.\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products.\nDistribution\nWe operate distribution centers in Puerto Rico, Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide.\nOther\nIn addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, each of our manufacturing locations also includes key manufacturing support functions, including quality control, process development, engineering, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies. See Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Regulation of Manufacturing Standards.\nManufacturing Initiatives\nWe have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and/or mitigating risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products.\nIn 2017, our next-generation biomanufacturing plant in Singapore was licensed by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for certain commercial-scale production. In 2019, we were approved to produce an additional product at that site. A next-generation biomanufacturing plant incorporates multiple innovative technologies into a single facility and therefore can be built in half the construction time with approximately half the operating cost of a traditional plant. Next-generation biomanufacturing plants require a smaller manufacturing footprint and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. Within the plants, the equipment is portable and smaller, and some components are disposable, which provides greater flexibility and speed when manufacturing different medicines simultaneously. This eliminates costly and complex retrofitting inherent in standard plants and allows Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility, ultimately impacting the speed at which a medicine becomes available for patients. The Singapore site also has a plant that has been approved to produce small molecule drugs for commercial manufacturing.\nIn July 2018, we announced the groundbreaking of our newest next-generation biomanufacturing plant, which is being constructed at our West Greenwich, Rhode Island, campus. The new plant is expected to be the first of its kind in the United States and will use our next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities. After construction has been completed and upon approval by the FDA and other global regulatory authorities, this plant will expand our capacity to manufacture certain products for U.S. and global markets.\nIn 2019, we also initiated projects to expand our manufacturing capabilities in Thousand Oaks, California as well as at contract manufacturers. These investments will initially support clinical manufacturing, but in the future may also be leveraged for commercial manufacturing.\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors-Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\nRaw Materials and Medical Devices\nCertain raw materials, medical devices (including companion diagnostics) and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by, and are the proprietary products of, unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\nWe perform various procedures to help authenticate the source of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. The procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform.\nGovernment Regulation\nRegulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. In order to clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex, and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of factors, including global regulatory implications, that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products.\nRegulation in the United States\nIn the United States, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products in addition to the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals.\nClinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky, and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very long-approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk-benefit profile.\nAfter laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program.\n\u2022\nIn phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects.\n\u2022\nIn phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side-effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.\n\u2022\nIn phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.\nThe FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDA\u2019s risk-benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of either a BLA for biologic products or a New Drug Application for small molecule products. We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application.\nApproval of Biosimilars. The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be \u201chighly similar\u201d and to have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity and potency. The relevance of demonstrating \u201csimilarity\u201d is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, as risk-benefit has previously been established. In order to preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators\u2019 products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator\u2019s data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. The FDA has released a number of guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, some of which remain in draft form.\nRegulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products. Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDA\u2019s implementing regulations and guidance. The FDA\u2019s review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses but is not limited to direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare-provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws.\nRegulation of Manufacturing Standards. The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to reinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval.\nRegulation of Combination Products. Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well.\nRegulation outside the United States\nIn EU countries as well as in Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States.\nIn the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessment-based on safety, quality and efficacy-is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products of Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMP\u2019s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval.\nIn the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, applicants seek and obtain regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is \u201chighly similar\u201d in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area.\nAs a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the EU, the EMA, in March 2019, relocated to Amsterdam. While negotiations continue regarding the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, the specific impact to the supervision, regulation and supply of medicines in the United Kingdom and Europe remain unclear.\nOther countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements.\nIn Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, the regulatory timelines can be less predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more-mature systems that would allow for submissions in more competitive time frames. Regarding biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., Australia, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea).\nIn some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby manufacturers must establish that their medical devices conform to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements.\nPostapproval Phase\nAfter approval, we continue to monitor adverse events and product complaints reported following the use of our products through routine post-marketing surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required per local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure implementation of signal detection, assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We also proactively monitor product complaints through our quality systems, which includes assessing our drug delivery devices for device complaints, adverse events and malfunctions. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Health authorities, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product\u2019s life cycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products.\nHealth authorities, including the FDA, also have the authority, before or after approval, to require companies to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), and we currently have REMSs for Prolia\u00ae, Nplate\u00ae and BLINCYTO\u00ae.\nOther Regulation\nWe are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false-claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescribing of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False-claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false-claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim.\nIn 2012, Amgen entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), which was formally closed out in August 2018. On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations related to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. Additionally, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future, our practices might be further challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA arguably includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Failure by our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators to comply with FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and/or regulations could result in significant civil or criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection. These laws and regulations relate to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continually evolving and developing, as these issues are the subjects of increasing amounts of attention in countries globally. For example, we are subject to the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020. Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant penalties.\nOur business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and regulations.\nResearch and Development and Selected Product Candidates\nWe focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness. We capitalize on our strengths in human genetics, novel biology and protein engineering. We leverage our biologic expertise and take a modality-independent approach to R&D. We use cutting-edge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases.\nOur discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, other combination modalities or new modalities. Leveraging more than two decades of research at deCODE, a global leader in analysis of the human genome, we are reshaping our portfolio and increasingly focusing efforts on validated targets. Human genetic validation is used whenever possible in order to enhance the likelihood of success.\nWe have continued to expand our genetics validation efforts as we believe it to be a strategic advantage by acquiring a DNA-encoded library drug discovery platform, which enables efficient discovery of novel small molecule drug candidates. The platform provides access to the screening of billions of molecules and efficient optimization of drug properties in the process of identifying the drug candidate. In addition, we announced a collaboration with a focus on discovering new connections between genetics and human disease and another collaboration to participate in a consortium to provide the whole-genome sequencing of approximately 500,000 participants in the United Kingdom.\nOther collaborations entered into include: one to create custom-designed proteins to improve human health and another with BeiGene to advance 20 medicines from our innovative oncology pipeline in China and globally. We anticipate utilizing data from clinical trials conducted in China to advance the development of our oncology portfolio globally.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our R&D expenses were $4.1 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.\nWe have major R&D centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California; Iceland; and the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties.\nOur clinical trial activities are conducted by both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Clinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors-We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.\nSome of our competitors are actively engaged in R&D in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to a product\u2019s eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position.\nIn addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal R&D efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these R&D arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the R&D.\nThe following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 11, 2020, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) The information in this section does not include other, nonregistrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication.\nWe may conduct nonregistrational clinical trials for various reasons, including to evaluate real-world outcomes or to collect additional safety information with regard to the use of our products.\nPhase 3\nClinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study; typically performed with registrational intent.\nPhase 2\nClinical trials investigate side-effect profiles and efficacy of product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.\nPhase 1\nClinical trials investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of product candidates in a small number of human subjects.\nPhase 3 Product Candidate Program Changes\nAs of February 12, 2019, we had 12 phase 3 programs, including biosimilars. As of February 12, 2020, we had 14 phase 3 programs, as regulatory approvals were received for two programs, one program terminated, one study was completed, three programs initiated phase 3 studies and three programs were acquired from Celgene. These changes are set forth in the following table.\nPhase 3 Product Candidate Patent Information\nThe following table describes our composition-of-matter patents that have been issued thus far for our product candidates in phase 3 development that have yet to be approved for any indication in the United States or the EU. Patents for products already approved for one or more indications in the United States or the EU but that are currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trials for additional indications are previously described. See Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Patents.\n* Patent expiration estimates are based on issued patents, which may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by competitors. The patent expiration estimates do not include any term adjustments, extensions or supplemental protection certificates that may be obtained in the future and thereby extend these dates. Corresponding patent applications are pending in other jurisdictions. Additional patents may be filed or issued and may provide additional exclusivity for the product candidate or its use.\nPhase 3 and 2 Program Descriptions\nThe following provides additional information about selected product candidates that have advanced into human clinical trials.\nEVENITY\u00ae\nEVENITY\u00ae is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of sclerostin.

It is being investigated in a phase 3 study for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The reference-product primary conditions are PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).\nBusiness Relationships\nFrom time to time, we enter into business relationships, including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the R&D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. In addition, we acquire product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. These arrangements generally provide for nonrefundable, upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature.\nTrade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of a business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information.\nNovartis\nWe are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig\u00ae. In the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly develop and collaborate on the commercialization of Aimovig\u00ae. Amgen, as the principal, recognizes product sales of Aimovig\u00ae in the United States, shares U.S. commercialization costs with Novartis and pays Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis holds global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig\u00ae and other specified migraine programs. Novartis pays Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the products in the Novartis exclusive territories and funds a portion of global R&D expenses. In addition, Novartis will make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds are achieved with respect to Aimovig\u00ae in the United States. Amgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig\u00ae worldwide.\nWe are currently involved in litigation with Novartis over our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of Aimovig\u00ae. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBayer HealthCare LLC\nWe are in a collaboration with Bayer HealthCare LLC (Bayer) to jointly develop and commercialize Nexavar\u00ae (sorafenib). In 2015, we amended the terms of our collaboration agreement with Bayer, which terminated the co-promotion agreement in the United States and transferred all U.S. operational responsibilities to Bayer, including commercial and medical affairs activities. Prior to the termination of the co-promotion agreement, we co-promoted Nexavar\u00ae with Bayer and shared equally in the profits in the United States. In lieu of this profit share, Bayer now pays us a royalty on U.S. sales of Nexavar\u00ae at a percentage rate in the high 30s. Outside the United States and Japan, Bayer manages all commercialization activities and incurs all sales and marketing expenditures and mutually agreed R&D expenses, and we reimburse Bayer for half of those expenditures. In all countries outside the United States and Japan, we receive 50% of net profits on sales of Nexavar\u00ae after deducting certain Bayer-related costs. The rights to develop and market Nexavar\u00ae in Japan are reserved to Bayer.\nDaVita Inc.\nIn January 2017, we entered into a six-year supply agreement with DaVita Inc. (DaVita), which superseded the previously existing, seven-year supply agreement that commenced in 2012. Pursuant to the 2017 agreement, we supply EPOGEN\u00ae and Aranesp\u00ae in amounts necessary to meet specified annual percentages of DaVita\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 requirements for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. Such percentages vary during the term of the agreement, but in each year are at least 90%. The agreement expires in 2022. The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by the other party.\nHuman Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, Amgen had approximately 23,400 staff members. We consider our staff relations to be good.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe executive officers of the Company as of February 12, 2020, are set forth below.\nMr. Robert A. Bradway, age 57, has served as a director of the Company since 2011 and Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2013.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management\u2019s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.\nOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability.\nSales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug utilization and contain costs. These payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result for our products in lower reimbursement rates or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, may limit our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced in an attempt to lower drug prices. These include proposals that would, for example, allow the U.S. government to negotiate directly on drug prices, limit drug prices based on prices abroad or permit importation of drugs from Canada. Proposals addressing drug pricing are likely to continue to be introduced and may be adopted and implemented in some form.\n-Changing U.S. federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our products\nA substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments. See Item 1. Business-Reimbursement. Our business has and will continue to be affected by legislative actions changing U.S. federal reimbursement policy. For example, beginning in 2019, legislation requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to provide greater discounts on products dispensed to patients in the coverage gap between the initial coverage limit of Medicare Part D and the program\u2019s catastrophic-coverage threshold has, and will continue to, reduce our net product sales relating to such patients. Further, following the change of party control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2018, Congressional focus on drug pricing has increased, placing our industry under greater Congressional scrutiny. For example, in January 2019, the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee sent letters to twelve different biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including Amgen, seeking documents and detailed information about such companies\u2019 drug-pricing practices. A number of other Congressional committees have also held hearings and evaluated proposed legislation on drug-pricing and payment policy. For example, in July 2019, the Senate Finance Committee advanced a bill that would, among other things, penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and\nD faster than the rate of inflation, cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D beneficiaries and require higher/additional manufacturer discounts in Medicare Part D. In December 2019, a drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3, passed the House of Representatives, which would, among other things, enable direct price negotiations by the federal government on certain drugs (with the maximum price paid by Medicare capped based on an international index), include a penalty for failing to reach agreement with the government and require that manufacturers offer these negotiated prices to other payers. Additional legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced by members of Congress or the Administration that, if enacted and implemented, could also affect access to and sales of our products, including but not limited to proposals to overhaul provisions of the ACA, to allow importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries and to base Medicare payment rates on an international index price. We expect continued significant focus on health care and drug-pricing legislation through 2020 leading up to the November U.S. presidential election and beyond.\nAlso, our business has been, and is expected to continue to be, affected by changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy resulting from executive actions, federal regulations and federal demonstration projects. For example, the Administration\u2019s drug-pricing blueprint released in May 2018 contains an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the negotiating power of the federal government, reduce drug prices and lower patient out-of-pocket costs with the potential to significantly affect, whether individually or collectively, our industry. Such policy ideas include, but are not limited to, moving coverage and reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare Part D and instituting a competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs in which competing third-party vendors take on the financial risk of acquiring drugs and billing Medicare.\nSince the release of the Administration\u2019s drug-pricing blueprint, the Administration and federal agencies, including the CMS, have announced a number of demonstration projects, recommendations, policies and proposals to implement various elements of the blueprint. CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and overseeing state Medicaid programs and Health Insurance Marketplaces and has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. For example, in late 2018, CMS began evaluating a pilot program that would initially, among other things, include fifty percent of Medicare Part B single source drugs and set payment amounts to more closely align with international drug prices, and in June 2019, Administration officials announced that the Office of Management and Budget was in the process of reviewing a draft proposed rule to implement this model. CMS has also issued guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to require that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before covering another therapy (Step Therapy) and lowered reimbursement rates for new Medicare Part B drugs. Congress is also interested in exploring solutions that may move biopharmaceutical manufacturers from back-end rebate agreements with PBMs to front-end discounts. In December 2019, the Administration released a proposed rule to allow states (or other non-federal government entities) to submit proposals to the FDA allowing for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. Such a rule could subject some of our product to importation.\nSeparate from the drug-pricing blueprint, CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. In ESRD, CMS uses a bundled payment system. Since 2018, Sensipar\u00ae and Parsabiv\u00ae, which are used in dialysis clinics and are curently outside of the bundled payment system, have been eligible for temporary drug add-on payment adjustments (TDAPA) and will continue to be eligible in 2020. CMS is expected to release details in 2020 on the rate setting analysis that it will conduct to determine whether and how CMS would adjust ESRD Prospective Payment System base rates to account for calcimimetics after the TDAPA for calcimimetics ends, which is expected in 2021. Additionally, in July 2019, CMS released a proposed rule creating a new mandatory payment model focused on encouraging greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for ESRD patients that, if finalized as proposed, could result in changes to treatment of dialysis patients, including reduction of the use of our ESAs. In November 2019, CMS announced additional voluntary payment models for nephrologists and dialysis facility partners that also seek to encourage home dialysis and preemptive transplantation through increased risk sharing beginning in 2021. CMS has also solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models. CMS initiated in 2016 the Oncology Care Model demonstration, which provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively affecting the efficacy of care. We believe the Oncology Care Model has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and expect it to continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, CMS announced a request for information on the Oncology Care First model, a new voluntary model that builds on the Oncology Care Model that would be slated to begin in January 2021.\nIn this dynamic environment, we are unable to predict which or how many of these various federal policy, legislative, regulatory, executive or administrative changes may ultimately be enacted and implemented. However, to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives further decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or affect our decisions regarding the pricing of or otherwise reduce the use of our U.S. products, or limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a biopharmaceutical manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.\n-Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states may negatively affect access to and have affected and may continue to affect sales of our products\nAt the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, drug importation programs or other new pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers publicly to report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. For example, in late 2017, California enacted a drug-pricing transparency bill that requires biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. Similar laws in Oregon and Washington were passed in 2019. States are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs. In January 2019, California\u2019s governor issued an executive order expanding state Medicaid coverage and directing its agencies and programs to develop a plan to consolidate drug purchases and to negotiate drug prices with biopharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, New York, Massachusetts and Ohio have established Medicaid drug spending caps. Additionally, Colorado, Florida, Maine and Vermont, have enacted laws, and several other states have proposed laws, to facilitate the importation of drugs from Canada. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs. Ultimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\n-U.S. commercial payer actions have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our products\nPayers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from the consolidation of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients\u2019 use of manufacturer commercial co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Payers have sought and will likely continue to seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as Step Therapy or requiring that patients receive the payer\u2019s prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mail-order pharmacy or a limited network of payer fully-owned mail-order or specialty pharmacies; payers may also choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha\u00ae has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria, and these requirements have limited, and may continue to limit, patient access to Repatha\u00ae treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha\u00ae by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers, including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has and may continue to limit patient use. For example, a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoned their Repatha\u00ae prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment. In late 2018 and early 2019, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha\u00ae available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare and on December 31, 2019 we discontinued the higher list price option for Repatha\u00ae. Despite these net and list price reductions, some payers have restricted and may continue to restrict patient access and may change formulary coverage for Repatha\u00ae, seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha\u00ae. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use and negatively affect Repatha\u00ae sales.\nFurther, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates requirements and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in the United States, in 2018, the top three PBMs oversaw greater than two-thirds of prescription claims as well as government and commercial covered lives. The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers. Also in 2018, two of\nthe nation\u2019s largest PBMs, Express Scripts and CVS Health, completed their combinations with major insurance companies Cigna and Aetna, respectively. Additional consolidation would further increase the leverage of such entities. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Policy reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the U.S. marketplace could have downstream implications or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities.\n-Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our products\nOutside the United States, we expect countries will continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See Item 1. Business-Reimbursement. International reference pricing (IRP) has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product\u2019s price in other countries. IRP policies can change quickly and frequently and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. In addition, countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA\u2019s approval of Repatha\u00ae for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the reimbursement for Repatha\u00ae in France is limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) following a national health technology assessment. While the pricing and reimbursement process in that country remains ongoing, the assessment currently limits our efforts in France to expand Repatha\u00ae access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region. Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products, a deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement, or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers has affected and may further negatively affect the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients and otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we realize for them. Such changes have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nWe currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future.\nWe currently face competition from biosimilars in Europe, the United States and Canada and from generics in the United States, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period has accelerated such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products have also experienced greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive regulatory approval standards and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate.\nIn the EU, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries and some Canadian provinces have adopted or are considering the adoption of biosimilar uptake measures such as physician prescribing quotas or automatic pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. While the degree of competitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products, in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing.\nIn the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Approval of Biosimilars. The first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market was Sandoz\u2019s Zarxio\u00ae, a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN\u00ae, in 2015. Since then, the FDA has approved additional biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of ENBREL, Neulasta\u00ae and EPOGEN\u00ae, and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. Three biosimilar versions of Neulasta\u00ae are now marketed in the United States and we expect other biosimilar versions of Neulasta\u00ae to receive approval in 2020. Impact to our Neulasta\u00ae sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. An approved biosimilar version of EPOGEN\u00ae has also launched in the United States, and we are currently involved in patent litigations with the manufacturers of the approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. Manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to compete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing or a broader portfolio of other products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.\nThe U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain interchangeable status from the FDA, which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products without prior approval from the prescriber in some states. In November 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. This may open the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products.\nIn addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law\u2019s provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. In December 2019, the Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product\u2019s original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as \u201cumbrella exclusivity\u201d). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements and implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars.\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents for the product by an additional six months. Our U.S. composition-of-matter patent for Sensipar\u00ae, a small molecule product, expired in March 2018. We are engaged in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic cinacalcet products surrounding our U.S. formulation patent that expires in September 2026. Several of these generic products have been approved by the FDA, and the manufacturer of one of the approved generic products began selling its product in late 2018 before reaching a settlement agreement with us in early January 2019. Our current litigation also includes disputes with a number of other manufacturers that began selling their approved generic cinacalcet products in the United States in early 2019. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If we do not prevail in these matters, these manufacturers and other companies may be able to launch their approved generic products into the U.S. market. In addition, even before the resolution of our ongoing litigation, a number of other companies have elected to launch their approved generic products at risk or have sought and obtained a judicial declaration that they are permitted to launch their generic products. As a result of the product already introduced and/or that could further be introduced into the U.S. market, our product sales for Sensipar\u00ae have been adversely affected and could be further materially and adversely affected.\nCalifornia is the first state to have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against \u201cpay for delay\u201d settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this newly-passed legislation, such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive. The legislation may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements.\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere this year and beyond as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nOur products face substantial competition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. We expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products have been competing and may continue to compete against products that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Driven by cost pressures, efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing. Third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included, and may in the future include, litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation has not discouraged, and may not in the future discourage, a potential violator from bringing the allegedly-infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nFurther, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the ACA. In addition, we are facing patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies, including those that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products or who are developing or have developed other biosimilar versions of such products. For example, we are currently engaged in litigation in the United States regarding MVASITM and KANJINTITM. While we have attempted, and may\ncontinue to attempt, to challenge the patents held by other companies, our efforts may be unsuccessful. Alternatively, such patents have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies. For information related to our patent litigation, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain of the existing patents on our products have expired. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Patents. As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors have been, and may continue to be, able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.\nGovernment agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. Professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians\u2019 groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. In addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products\u2019 reimbursement by government and private payers. Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations. For example, CVS Caremark indicated in August 2018 that it will begin utilizing third-party cost effectiveness analyses to make formulary and coverage determinations for newly-approved drugs. In addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service effects of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such health technology assessment organizations have recommended, and may in the future recommend, reimbursement for certain of our products for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDA\u2019s or foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations, or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets. We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In the United States, a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019. A subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDA\u2019s activities, including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals.\nRegulatory authorities have questioned, and may in the future question, the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD), or to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by PFS. Demonstrating that the product candidate induces MRD-negative responses or produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the cardiovascular setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, as an elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha\u00ae reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha\u00ae to prevent cardiovascular events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha\u00ae to reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular events, and also to be used, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDL-C. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current labels.\nSome of our products have been approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in March 2018, we announced that the FDA approved BLINCYTO\u00ae under accelerated approval for the treatment of adults and children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission with MRD greater than or equal to 0.1 percent. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators\u2019 requirements that were conditions of a product\u2019s accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product\u2019s labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market.\nRegulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product\u2019s marketing authorization.\nSafety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drug\u2019s benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product\u2019s approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:\n\u2022\nrevised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;\n\u2022\nrequirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;\n\u2022\npost-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls of our approved products;\n\u2022\nrequired changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing;\n\u2022\nrevocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;\n\u2022\nincreased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or\n\u2022\ntreatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies.\nFor example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials for EVENITY\u00ae but not in another, larger phase 3 study, in April 2019 the FDA approved EVENITY\u00ae for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial.\nIn addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the ACA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to implement it, discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA or other legislation or policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure \u201cfirst-to-market\u201d or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D.\nAmgen invests heavily in R&D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&D projects produce commercial products. Product candidates, including biosimilar product candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:\n\u2022\nthe product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans;\n\u2022\nthe necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize;\n\u2022\nother parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\nthe pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined;\n\u2022\nthe biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; and\n\u2022\na companion diagnostic device that is required with the use of a product candidate is not approved by the necessary regulatory authority.\nWe have spent considerable time, energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics and acquiring access to libraries of genetic information with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our R&D decisions and investments. We have focused our R&D strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence. However, product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including the factors listed above.\nA number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in May 2015, we terminated our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab, a product candidate in phase 3, with AstraZeneca. The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program that occurred late in the development program, which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative effect on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPR&D) or other intangible assets.\nWe must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.\nBefore we sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels.\nFurther, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened, and will continue to open, clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. Additionally, regional disruptions, including natural disasters or health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics), could significantly disrupt the timing of clinical trials. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, or such sites experience disruptions as a result of a natural disaster or health emergency, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening or monitoring patients in our clinical trials. See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights\nto products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. In addition, delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products\u2019 or product candidates\u2019 relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively affect the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively affected. As a result, such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide.\nClinical trials must generally be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In some cases, we may design a clinical trial based on the standard of care we anticipate will exist at the time our study is completed. The duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer or that have not become the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. Additionally, the views of regulatory agencies relating to the requirements for accelerated approval may change over time, and trial designs that were sufficient to support accelerated approvals for some oncology products may not be considered sufficient for later candidates. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval.\nEven after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we agreed to and conducted additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations.\nSome of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.\nMany of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta\u00ae is available as part of the Neulasta\u00ae Onpro\u00ae kit, and our AutoTouch\u00ae reusable autoinjector is used with Enbrel Mini\u00ae single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology products in early stage development, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development or approval of such devices is delayed, such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop, modify, or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could\nresult in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017, the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it is evaluating our Neulasta\u00ae Onpro\u00ae kit. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related, approved products.\nSome of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products.\nWe depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. Business-Significant Developments-Collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd., and Item 1. Business-Business Relationships.\nFailures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&D and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. For example, we are currently involved in litigation with Novartis over our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of Aimovig\u00ae. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While our collaboration remains in place until the litigation is resolved and we remain committed to continuing to work with Novartis to sell and deliver Aimovig\u00ae, it is possible that the dispute may nevertheless affect the efficiency of operation and future growth of the collaboration. The litigation may also affect or delay, or lead to a termination of, other projects with Novartis.\nThe adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax.\nOur tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business, and a number of audits are currently underway. Tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS\u2019s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Although final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months, such resolution could have a material negative effect on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued.\nOur provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act) is complex and further regulations and interpretations are still being issued. We could face audit challenges to our application of the new law that could have a negative effect on our provision for income taxes. A change to the U.S. tax system, such as a repeal or modification of the 2017 Tax Act, a change to the tax system in a jurisdiction where we have\nsignificant operations, such as the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, or changes in tax law in the United States or other jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations.\nWe perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials.\nThe global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\nWe currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Thousand Oaks manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates.\nIn addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes in early 2020 and Hurricane Maria in 2017. These natural disasters have affected public and private properties and Puerto Rico\u2019s electric grid and communications networks. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility operated with electrical power from backup diesel powered generators for some time. We are also operating on backup generators since the early 2020 earthquakes. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase the use of our generators or to continue using them exclusively. In addition, future storms or other natural disasters or events could cause a more significant effect on our manufacturing operations. Also, during the summer of 2019 political instability in the Puerto Rico government led to civil unrest and the resignation and replacement of the governor. Although our ability to manufacture and supply our products has not, to date, been affected by these natural disasters or the political instability, any substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\nHurricane Maria, the earthquakes of early 2020 and the political situation in Puerto Rico have placed greater stress on the island\u2019s already challenged economy. Beginning in 2016, the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion in debt. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which established a Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including a stay of debtholder litigation. In May 2017, the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico and certain of its governmental entities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Certain creditors and labor unions have brought suit claiming the appointment process of the Oversight Board was unconstitutional, and as of October 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on these claims. If the U.S. Supreme Court were to hold that PROMESA has a constitutional infirmity and that actions taken by the Oversight Board are invalid, the commencement of all Title III proceedings could be invalid and the current debt restructuring process and the debtholder litigation stay under Title III of PROMESA could be in jeopardy.\nEach year since 2017, the Oversight Board has prepared and updated Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal plan and has certified its budget, imposing significant expense reductions across the government, considering federal disaster funding related to Hurricane Maria and projecting material deficits once the stimulus effects of the disaster recovery dissipate. Each plan has stressed the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address Puerto Rico\u2019s challenging economic and demographic trends. The government of Puerto Rico challenged several budget measures imposed by the Oversight Board; these challenges have been dismissed by the Title III Court and affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\nIn addition, the 2017 Tax Act no longer permits deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings, although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced 10.5% rate. Given Puerto Rico\u2019s challenged economy and disaster recovery needs, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base, which contributes significantly to Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, due to competition from other locations subject to similar levels of taxation.\nWhile PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, Puerto Rico\u2019s ongoing economic and demographic trend challenges and political situation, the effects of natural disasters and the\neffects of the 2017 Tax Act or other potential tax law changes have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, the territorial government\u2019s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business and could create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products, on our business and on our product sales.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\nWe rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, Scandinavian Health Limited Group is our single source of SureClick\u00ae autoinjectors for Repatha\u00ae, ENBREL, Aimovig\u00ae, AMGEVITATM and Aranesp\u00ae. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.\nAmong the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;\n\u2022\nadverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nunexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;\n\u2022\na material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials;\n\u2022\ndiscovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks on supplier systems; and\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics) and natural disasters.\nFor example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN\u00ae glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nManufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\nManufacturing biologic and small molecule human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. Business-Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials-Manufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be affected by:\n\u2022\ncapacity of manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\ncontamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nnatural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics) or natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in forecasts of future demand;\n\u2022\ntiming and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;\n\u2022\nupdates of manufacturing specifications;\n\u2022\ncontractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\ntiming and outcome of product quality testing;\n\u2022\npower failures and/or other utility failures;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks on supplier systems;\n\u2022\nbreakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment (including our information technology systems and network-connected control systems or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers); and/or\n\u2022\ndelays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews, inspections and approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended U.S. federal government shutdown.\nIf any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our third-party contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials, we may be unable to start or increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp\u00ae lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot, and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix\u00ae distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on some product vials. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes, those of our third-party contract manufacturers and those of certain of our third-party service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider. If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements, new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons, this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes. Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to timely implement such changes, or at all.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our third-party contract manufacturers and service providers. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations, they may mandate corrective actions and/or issue warning letters, or even restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, prohibiting us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. See also Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. See A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems and network-connected control systems and our data, interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on\nthe uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively affected by natural disasters or security threats.\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business.\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN\u00ae, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and accounts for approximately 80% of all EPOGEN\u00ae sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. The three largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor.\nOur efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.\nWe seek innovation through significant investment in both internal R&D and external transactions including collaborations, partnering, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (collectively, acquisition activity). Acquisition activities may be subject to regulatory approvals or other requirements that are not within our control. There can be no assurance that such regulatory or other approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions required in connection with our acquisition activities will be satisfied or waived, which could result in us being unable to complete the planned acquisition activities.\nAcquisition activities are complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may divert our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities and restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of such transactions within the expected timeframe or at all. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Further, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses, products or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the transaction and grow our business and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. These and other challenges may arise in connection with our recent acquisition of Otezla\u00ae and/or collaboration with BeiGene, or with other acquisition activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.\nAs we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Emerging market countries, including China, may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to\nreduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. In addition, we have a number of financial instruments referencing the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the U.K Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021, and it is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2022. While various replacement reference rates have been proposed, an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted and the specific mechanisms to replace LIBOR in our existing LIBOR-linked financial instruments have not been finalized. As such, the replacement of LIBOR could have an adverse effect on the market for, or value of, our LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nOur international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments. Our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, including China, is dependent upon the establishment of an environment that is supportive of biopharmaceutical innovation, sustained access for our products and limited pricing controls. We are also subject to the economic and political uncertainties stemming from the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d which occurred on January 31, 2020. While our manufacturing and packaging activities take place largely outside the United Kingdom, minimizing the need to make costly and significant changes to those operations, we have nevertheless been working to put in place contingency plans to attempt to mitigate the effects of Brexit on us. Overall, the legal and operational challenges of our international business operations, along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products, may result in a material adverse effect on our international product sales, business and results of operations.\nOur business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.\nWe are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act. We cannot ensure that all our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations relating to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. As a result, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and our being excluded from government healthcare programs. We may also see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. For example, prosecutors are placing greater scrutiny on commercial co-pay support programs, and further enforcement actions and investigations regarding such programs could limit our ability to provide co-pay assistance to commercial patients. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems and network-connected control systems and our data, interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation.\nTo achieve our business objectives, we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems, including cloud services and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or affect our reputation.\nOur information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our R&D efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the use of harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, and can be deployed through various means including the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites and the use of social engineering. Attacks such as those seen with other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access important data needed to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and/or distributing our products. For example, in 2017, a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. As a result of the cyberattack, its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively affected. Our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials and/or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other parties. In some cases, we utilize third-party service providers to process, store, manage or transmit such data, which may increase our risk. Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) or lapses by employees, service providers (including providers of information technology-specific services), nation states, organized crime organizations, \u201chacktivists\u201d or others, create risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors, or the public. Finally, domestic and global government regulators, our business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners with business services and companies we may acquire may face similar risks, and security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data. For example, in 2019, two vendors that perform testing and analytical services that we use in developing and manufacturing our products have experienced cyberattacks requiring us to disconnect our systems from the vendors\u2019 systems. While we were able to reconnect our systems following restoration of the vendor\u2019s capabilities without significantly affecting product availability, a more extended service outage affecting this or other vendors, particularly where such vendor is the single source from which we obtain the services, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers.\nAlthough we have experienced system breakdowns, attacks and information security breaches, we do not believe such breakdowns, attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical or sensitive data and systems. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks, or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss or exposure of critical, proprietary, private, confidential or otherwise sensitive data, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or negatively affect our stock price. While we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data.\nWe are also subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection, including laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and developing and the subject of significant attention globally. For example, we are subject to the EU\u2019s GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective in January 2020, each of which contemplate substantial penalties (penalties for noncompliance could be 4% of an organization\u2019s annual global revenues under the GDPR. Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. Failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.\nOur operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. Financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients\u2019 ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors\u2019, customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant worsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks facing us.\nWe maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nOur stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions, including via social media channels, of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would negatively affect our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid effect on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially affected.\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nThe capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We expect to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we strategically plan to pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.",

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.\nForward-looking statements\nThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management\u2019s assumptions.

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world\u2019s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. In 2020, we celebrate our 40th anniversary, continuing our history of focusing on innovative medicines that have the potential to be first-in-class molecules and that have a large-effect size on serious diseases.\nOur principal products-those with the most significant annual commercial sales-are ENBREL, Neulasta\u00ae, Prolia\u00ae, XGEVA\u00ae, Aranesp\u00ae, KYPROLIS\u00ae, EPOGEN\u00ae and our recently acquired product Otezla\u00ae. We also market a number of other products, including Nplate\u00ae, Vectibix\u00ae, Repatha\u00ae, Parsabiv\u00ae, Sensipar\u00ae/Mimpara\u00ae, BLINCYTO\u00ae, Aimovig\u00ae, NEUPOGEN\u00ae, KANJINTITM, AMGEVITATM, EVENITY\u00ae, MVASITM, IMLYGIC\u00ae and Corlanor\u00ae. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.\nOur strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, cardiovascular disease, nephrology and neuroscience and conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and cardiovascular/metabolic diseases. In 2019, we advanced our innovative pipeline, launched branded biosimilar programs, built our global geographic reach and expanded our next generation manufacturing capabilities, while returning capital to shareholders.\nDuring the year we delivered strong financial results while facing competition from biosimilars and generics. Total product sales decreased 1% as lower net selling prices were offset partially by volume growth. Product sales decreased 5% in the United States and grew 11% in the rest of the world. Total operating expenses increased 2% as we invested in our innovative R&D pipeline, including our early oncology assets.\nWe continued to advance our pipeline, including AMG 510, which was granted fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with previously treated metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation. We launched EVENITY\u00ae in the United States and Japan, and it was granted marketing authorization in Europe; and the United States label for KYPROLIS\u00ae was expanded. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program with the launches of KANJINTITM and MVASITM in the United States and the approval of AVSOLATM for all approved indications of the reference product REMICADE\u00ae (infliximab) in the United States. Lastly, we made a regulatory submission for ABP 798 in the United States.\nWe have also continued to invest in external opportunities to augment our internal programs and products. We completed our acquisition of worldwide rights to Otezla\u00ae, the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We strengthened our international footprint with the announcement of a strategic collaboration with BeiGene to expand our oncology presence in China. In addition, we expanded our human genetics capabilities, by entering into a collaboration with a regional healthcare system in the United States and joining a consortium to perform whole genome sequencing of approximately 500,000 participants from the United Kingdom. Our human genetics capabilities allow us to identify new development targets in our chosen areas of therapeutic focus.\nCash flows from operating activities were $9.2 billion, enabling us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2019, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.45 per share of common stock. In December 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2020. We also repurchased 40.2 million shares of our common stock throughout 2019 at an aggregate cost of $7.6 billion.\nOur long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Patents, and Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and we also are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.\nRising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year.\nSee Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.\nSelected Financial Information\nThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data):\nIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held at wholesaler customers and end users such as pharmacies.\nTotal product sales decreased for 2019, driven primarily by a decline in net selling price, offset partially by higher unit demand. For 2020, we expect net selling price to continue to decline.\nOther revenues decreased for 2019, driven primarily by lower milestone payments, offset partially by higher royalties.\nOperating expenses increased for 2019, driven primarily by higher spending in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, offset partially by an impairment charge associated with an IPR&D asset in 2018.\nAlthough changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nResults of Operations\nProduct sales\nWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nFuture sales of our products will depend in part on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition, in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products\u2019 significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition.\nENBREL\nTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increase in ENBREL sales for 2019 was driven primarily by favorable impacts from changes in accounting estimates of sales deductions and an increase in net selling price, offset partially by lower unit demand. For 2020, we expect the trend of lower unit demand to continue.\nThe decrease in ENBREL sales for 2018 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price.\nIn April 2019, the FDA approved a second biosimilar version of ENBREL, and we are involved in patent litigations with the two companies seeking to market their FDA-approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other companies are also developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL. Companies with approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL may seek to enter the U.S. market if we are not successful in our litigations, or even earlier.\nNeulasta\u00ae\nTotal Neulasta\u00ae sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe decrease in global Neulasta\u00ae sales for 2019 was driven by the impact of biosimilar competition on net selling price and unit demand. Neulasta\u00ae sales for 2019 included a $98 million order in the first quarter from the U.S. government.\nThe decrease in global Neulasta\u00ae sales for 2018 was driven primarily by favorable changes in accounting estimates of product returns in 2017, offset partially by favorable changes in inventory. Neulasta\u00ae sales for 2018 included a $55 million order in the fourth quarter from the U.S. government.\nBiosimilar versions of Neulasta\u00ae have been approved and launched, and other biosimilar versions may also receive approval in the near future. Therefore, we face increased competition in the United States and Europe, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of Neulasta\u00ae. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations related to these and other biosimilars, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProlia\u00ae\nTotal Prolia\u00ae sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increases in global Prolia\u00ae sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven by higher unit demand. Prolia\u00ae, which has a six-month dosing interval, has exhibited a historical sales pattern, with the first and third quarters of a year representing lower sales than the second and fourth quarters of a year.\nXGEVA\u00ae\nTotal XGEVA\u00ae sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increases in global XGEVA\u00ae sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven primarily by higher unit demand.\nAranesp\u00ae\nTotal Aranesp\u00ae sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe decreases in global Aranesp\u00ae sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of competition on unit demand in the United States.\nAranesp\u00ae faces competition from a long-acting ESA. Aranesp\u00ae also faces competition from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN\u00ae. Other biosimilar versions of EPOGEN\u00ae may also receive approval in the future. In 2019, sales in the United States declined, and we expect them to continue to decline at a faster rate in 2020 due to short- and long-acting competition.\nKYPROLIS\u00ae\nTotal KYPROLIS\u00ae sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe increase in global KYPROLIS\u00ae sales for 2019 was driven primarily by higher unit demand.\nThe increase in global KYPROLIS\u00ae sales for 2018 was driven primarily by higher unit demand, offset partially by lower net selling price.\nWe are engaged in litigation with two related companies that are challenging our material patents related to KYPROLIS\u00ae and that are seeking to market generic carfilzomib products. Separately, we have entered into confidential settlement agreements with other companies developing generic carfilzomib products, and the court has entered consent judgments enjoining those companies from infringing certain of our patents, subject to terms of the confidential settlement agreements. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The FDA has reported that it has tentatively approved Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) filed by two companies for generic carfilzomib products. The date of final approval of those ANDAs is governed by the Hatch-Waxman Act and any applicable settlement agreements between the parties.\nEPOGEN\u00ae\nTotal EPOGEN\u00ae sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe decreases in EPOGEN\u00ae sales for 2019 and 2018 were driven primarily by a decline in net selling price due to our contract with DaVita. See Part I, Item I. Business-Business Relationships. In 2020, we expect a lower net selling price compared with 2019 due to our contract with DaVita.\nA biosimilar version of EPOGEN\u00ae has been approved and launched, and other biosimilar versions may also receive approval in the future. Therefore, we face increased competition in the United States, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of EPOGEN\u00ae. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigation related to one of these biosimilars, see Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSensipar\u00ae/Mimpara\u00ae\nTotal Sensipar\u00ae/Mimpara\u00ae sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe decrease in global Sensipar\u00ae/Mimpara\u00ae sales for 2019 was driven by the impact of generic competitors on unit demand.\nThe increase in global Sensipar\u00ae/Mimpara\u00ae sales for 2018 was driven primarily by an increase in net selling price in the United States, offset partially by lower unit demand.\nOur U.S. composition-of-matter patent related to Sensipar\u00ae, a small molecule, expired in March 2018. We are involved in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic cinacalcet products surrounding our U.S. formulation patent, which expires in September 2026. During the course of the patent litigation, we have entered into confidential settlement agreements with several of these companies. The court has entered consent judgments enjoining certain of those companies from infringing certain of our patents, subject to terms of the confidential settlement agreements. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Companies manufacturing generics began selling their generic cinacalcet products in the United States in late 2018 and 2019. Sensipar\u00ae sales have been and, we believe, may continue to be adversely impacted as a result of generic-product sales in the U.S. market.\nOther products\nOther product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\n* Change in excess of 100%.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nCost of sales\nCost of sales increased to 18.6% of total revenues for 2019, driven primarily by unfavorable product mix and amortization of intangible assets as a result of our acquisition of Otezla\u00ae, offset partially by lower royalties and lower manufacturing costs.\nCost of sales decreased to 17.3% of total revenues for 2018, driven primarily by lower royalty costs, expenses related to Hurricane Maria in 2017 and lower acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher manufacturing costs.\nResearch and development\nThe Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (i) research and early pipeline, (ii) later-stage clinical programs and (iii) marketed products. These categories are described below:\nR&D expense by category was as follows (in millions):\nThe increase in R&D expense for 2019 was driven primarily by higher spend in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, offset partially by lower marketed-product support.\nThe increase in R&D expense for 2018 was driven by higher spend on our early pipeline and later-stage clinical programs as well as external business development expense in research and early pipeline, offset partially by lower marketed-product support.\nSelling, general and administrative\nThe decrease in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 2019 was driven primarily by lower general and administrative expenses, the end of certain amortization charges in 2018 and lower spend for launched and marketed products, offset partially by spending for Otezla\u00ae commercial-related expenses.\nThe increase in SG&A expense for 2018 was driven primarily by investments in product launches and marketed-product support.\nOther\nOther operating expenses for 2019 included $47 million in restructuring costs.\nOther operating expenses for 2018 included a $330 million impairment charge associated with an IPR&D asset and a $42 million favorable net change in the fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. See Part IV-Note 17, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther operating expenses for 2017 included $284 million of impairment-related charges associated with an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and $83 million of certain net charges related to a restructuring plan.\nNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes\nNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nInterest expense, net\nThe decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2019 was due primarily to a reduction in outstanding long-term debt as a result of maturities in the current year.\nThe increase in Interest expense, net, for 2018 was due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates on variable-rate debt.\nInterest and other income, net\nThe increase in Interest and other income, net, for 2019 was due primarily to net gains on sales of investments in interest-bearing securities liquidated to fund our acquisition of Otezla\u00ae and our investment in BeiGene compared with losses in the prior year, offset partially by reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and a gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A), in the first quarter of 2018. See Part IV-Note 2, Acquisitions, and Note 21, Subsequent events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe decrease in Interest and other income, net, for 2018 was due primarily to higher investment losses and lower interest income as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio, offset partially by gains on our equity investments and a net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of K-A.\nIncome taxes\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 compared with 2018 was due primarily to a prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform.\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2018 compared with 2017 was due primarily to impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform.\nAs previously disclosed, we received an RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS\u2019s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued.\nSee Summary of Critical Accounting Policies-Income taxes, and Part IV-Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nSelected financial data was as follows (in millions):\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nWe have global access to our $8.9 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.\nCapital allocation\nConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner, and we consider several alternatives such as payment of dividends, stock repurchases, repayment of debt and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest.\nWe intend to continue to invest in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company\u2019s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.\nThe Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.15 per share of common stock paid in 2017, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.32 per share of common stock paid in 2018 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.45 per share of common stock paid in 2019. In December 2019, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2020.\nWe also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $7.7 billion. In 2018, we repurchased $17.9 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $17.8 billion, which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. In 2017, we repurchased $3.1 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.2 billion. In May 2019 and December 2019,\nour Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, $6.5 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.\nAs a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.\nWe believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.\nFinancing arrangements\nThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2019, were $3.0 billion and $27.0 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2018, were $4.4 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody\u2019s), and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch), assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A- with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB+ with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.\nDuring 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any debt or debt securities. During 2017, we issued debt with an aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we repaid debt of $4.5 billion, $1.1 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.6 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.\nTo hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2017, we issued and repaid an aggregate of $12.3 billion of commercial paper and had a maximum outstanding balance of $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program. During 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nIn 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) LIBOR plus 1% or (ii) the highest of (A) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. The agreement contains provisions relating to the determination of successor rates to address the possible phase-out or unavailability of designated reference rates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.\nIt is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2022. While various replacement reference rates have been discussed, an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted. Therefore, the mechanics to modify existing contracts that reference LIBOR have not been finalized. However, we do not expect that a change in the reference rate of our contracts will be material. See Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets.\nIn February 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2023.\nCertain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2019.\nSee Part IV-Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash flows\nOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):\nOperating\nCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2019 due primarily to changes in working capital, an increase in payments to the IRS related to an advance deposit and lower Net income. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2018 due primarily to improvements in working capital, offset partially by higher payments to tax authorities.\nInvesting\nCash provided by investing activities during 2019 and 2018 was due primarily to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $20.0 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. The liquidation of portions of our marketable securities portfolio in 2019 was due primarily to fund the acquisition of Otezla\u00ae and our investment in BeiGene and, in 2018, to fund the tender offer to repurchase our common stock. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 was due primarily to net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $618 million, $738 million and $664 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We currently estimate 2020 spending on capital projects to be approximately $700 million.\nFinancing\nCash used in financing activities during 2019 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $7.7 billion, repayments of debt of $4.5 billion and payments of dividends of $3.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2018 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $17.8 billion, payments of dividends of $3.5 billion and repayments of debt of $1.1 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was due primarily to payments of dividends of $3.4 billion and repurchases of common stock of $3.2 billion, offset partially by proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $71 million.\nSee Part IV-Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 16, Stockholders\u2019 equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.\nThe following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions):\n(1)\nLong-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the terms of the related hedge contracts. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2019, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts, which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $309 million. See Part IV-Note 15, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(2)\nLong-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable-rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2019, in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IV-Note 15, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(3)\nLong-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayments of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively converted interest payments and principal repayments on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV-Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(4)\nOperating lease obligations includes payments for leases that have not yet commenced, net of lease incentives, and excludes $141 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities.\n(5)\nPurchase obligations relate primarily to (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.\n(6)\nUnder the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. See Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments-Commitments - U.S. repatriation tax, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(7)\nLiabilities for UTBs are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV-Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of K-A and BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2019, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.3 billion, including $325 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. Contingent\nconsideration with respect to the acquisition of Dezima Pharma B.V. was excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of AMG 899, upon which payments are based. See Part IV-Note 17, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nProduct sales and sales deductions\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions):\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, total sales deductions were 41%, 39% and 35% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, was driven primarily by the impact of increases in U.S. rebates and to a lesser extent, higher chargebacks. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nIn the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.\nAccruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold.\nRebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements, which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual\nsettlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ.\nWholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.\nProduct returns\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.\nIncome taxes\nWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.\nCertain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.\nWe are a vertically-integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct operations based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035.\nAs previously disclosed, we received an RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS\u2019s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued. See Part IV-Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nContingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV-Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously.\nWhile it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nValuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions\nWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. See Part IV-Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndetermining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;\n\u2022\nprojecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;\n\u2022\nestimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the business combination date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included but were not limited to the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.\nWe believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations and assets acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset\u2019s fair value and its carrying value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference, and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.\nEstimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Part IV-Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2019.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.\nIn the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Except as noted below, we have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nInterest-rate-sensitive financial instruments\nOur portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, was composed of U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, residential-mortgage-backed and other mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market mutual funds and other short-term interest-bearing securities composed principally of commercial paper, and with respect to investments as of December 31, 2018, other government-related securities. The fair values of our available-for-sale investments were $8.2 billion and $28.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2019, would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair value of these securities, and with respect to available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in a reduction of approximately $360 million in fair value. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $29.9 billion and a fair value of $33.7 billion. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.9 billion and a fair value of $35.0 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rates, with variable-rate debt having carrying values of $300 million and $850 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis\npoint decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, would have resulted in increases of $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below.\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.6 billion and $11.0 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $380 million and $460 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing years. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, that hedge our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $280 million and $320 million, respectively.\nForeign-currency-sensitive financial instruments\nOur international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.0 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $0.9 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.1 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.\nWe have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing years\u2019 income from these contracts would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2019, we had primarily euro based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.0 billion. As of December 31, 2018, we had primarily euro based open foreign currency forward and option contracts with notional amounts of $4.5 billion and $21 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the fair values of these contracts were a $223 million asset and a $31 million liability. As of December 31, 2018, the fair values of these contracts were a $181 million asset and a $26 million liability. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open as of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $930 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $400 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $810 million on this date and, in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $380 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had open short-duration foreign currency forward contracts that mature in less than one month with notional amounts of $1.2 billion and $737 million, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\nMarket-price-sensitive financial instruments\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we were exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small-capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, was not material.\nCounterparty credit risks\nOur financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring that transactions be made only with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&P, Moody\u2019s or Fitch; and it requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.",

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen\u2019s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgen\u2019s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019.\nManagement determined that, as of December 31, 2019, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.\nManagement excluded Otezla\u00ae, which was acquired by us on November 21, 2019, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. Total assets and revenues of Otezla\u00ae excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting were approximately 0.6% of total assets and 0.8% of total revenues as of and for the period ended December 31, 2019.\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Amgen Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Amgen Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amgen Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management\u2019s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the worldwide rights to Otezla\u00ae acquired from Celgene Corporation, which is included in the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 0.6% of total assets, as of December 31, 2019 and 0.8% of revenues, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the worldwide rights to Otezla\u00ae acquired from Celgene Corporation.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and schedule and our report dated February 12, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nLos Angeles, California\nFebruary 12, 2020",

    "item_12": "Item 12.\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Existing Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2019, concerning the shares of our common stock that may be issued under any form of award granted under our equity compensation plans in effect as of December 31, 2019 (including upon the exercise of options, upon the vesting of awards of restricted stock units (RSUs) or when performance units are earned and related dividend equivalents have been granted).\n(1)\nThe Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan employs a fungible share-counting formula for determining the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each restricted stock unit, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share-counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance, and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 200% of the performance units granted in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes (i) 4,823,162 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $157.00; (ii) 3,324,005 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 180,878 related dividend equivalents); and (iii) 2,086,513 shares subject to outstanding 2017, 2018 and 2019 performance units (including 97,836 related dividend equivalents). The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2019, employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event above target performance on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units is achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n(2)\nThis plan has terminated as to future grants. The number under column (a) with respect to this plan includes 13,439 shares issuable upon the settlement of deferred RSUs (including 2,357 related dividend equivalents).\n(3)\nThe Amgen Profit Sharing Plan for Employees in Ireland (the Profit Sharing Plan) was approved by the Board of Directors on July 28, 2011. The Profit Sharing Plan permits eligible employees of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries located in Ireland who participate in the Profit Sharing Plan to apply a portion of their qualifying bonus and salary to the purchase the Company\u2019s common stock on the open market at the market price by a third-party trustee as described in the Profit Sharing Plan.\nSecurity Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers and Certain Beneficial Owners\nInformation about security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management is incorporated by reference from the sections entitled SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS and SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS in our Proxy Statement.",
