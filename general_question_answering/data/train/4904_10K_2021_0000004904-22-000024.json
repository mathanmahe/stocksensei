    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nOverview and Description of Major Subsidiaries\nAEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925. It is a public utility holding company that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries.\nThe service areas of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served. The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service, consisting of generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their retail customers. Restructuring laws in Michigan, Ohio and the ERCOT area of Texas have caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers.\nThe member companies of the AEP System have contractual, financial and other business relationships with the other member companies, such as participation in the AEP System savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of electricity and transportation and handling of fuel. The companies of the AEP System also obtain certain accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering, financial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider, AEPSC.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 16,688 employees. Because it is a holding company rather than an operating company, AEP has no employees. The material subsidiaries of AEP are as follows:\nAEP Texas\nOrganized in Delaware in 1925, AEP Texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1,082,000 retail customers through REPs in west, central and southern Texas.

The authorized ROE for riders with an approved equity return (Decommissioning Rider and the Environmental Surcharge) is 9.10%.\n(a)Pretax income does not include intercompany eliminations.\nCLASSES OF SERVICE\nThe principal classes of service from which AEP\u2019s subsidiaries derive revenues and the amount of such revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nAEP Texas\nAEPTCo\nAPCo\nI&M\nOPCo\nPSO\nSWEPCo\nFINANCING\nGeneral\nCompanies within the AEP System generally use short-term debt to finance working capital needs. Short-term debt may also be used to finance acquisitions, construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with long-term debt. In recent history, short-term funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and AEP\u2019s commercial paper program. Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program. Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity. See \u201cFinancial Condition\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nAEP\u2019s revolving credit agreement (which backstops the commercial paper program) includes covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility, including a maximum debt/capital test. In addition, the acceleration of AEP\u2019s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants. With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreement. A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event. See \u201cFinancial Condition\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional financing arrangements, such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements, including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities.\nENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS\nGeneral\nAEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with regard to air and water-quality control and other environmental matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local\nauthorities. The environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the AEP System are outlined below.\nClean Water Act Requirements\nOperations for AEP subsidiaries are subject to the CWA, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants. In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for water withdrawals at existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant\u2019s cooling water intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water. The standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day. A schedule for compliance with the standard is established by the permit agency and incorporated in NPDES permits.\nIn November 2015, the Federal EPA issued a final rule revising ELG for electricity generating facilities. The rule established limits on FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater to be imposed in NPDES permits as soon as possible after November 2018 and no later than December 2023. The Federal EPA further revised the rule in August 2020 for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water extending the compliance date to December 2025 and establishing additional options.\nIn January 2020, the Federal EPA issued a final rule revising the scope of the \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d subject to CWA regulation. In August 2021, this rule was vacated by a federal court and shortly thereafter, in December 2021, the Federal EPA proposed a rule that would roll back the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d to the pre-2015 definition. See \u201cEnvironmental Issues - Clean Water Act Regulations\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nCoal Ash Regulation\nAEP\u2019s operations produce a number of different coal combustion by-products, including fly ash, bottom ash, gypsum and other materials. A rule by the Federal EPA regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals, including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units. The rule requires certain standards for location, groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities. If existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards, they will be required to close. In August 2020, the Federal EPA revised the CCR rule to include a requirement that unlined CCR storage ponds cease operations and initiate closure by April 11, 2021. The revised rule provides two options for seeking an extension of that date. AEP filed extension requests for seven facilities, but as of December 31, 2021, the Federal EPA had not acted upon any of those requests. See \u201cEnvironmental Issues - Coal Combustion Residual (CCR) Rule\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nClean Air Act Requirements\nThe CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation\u2019s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions. The major CAA programs affecting AEP\u2019s power plants are described below. The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements.\nThe Acid Rain Program\nThe CAA includes a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO2 emissions from power plants and requirements for power plants to reduce NOx emissions through the use of available combustion controls, collectively called the Acid Rain Program. AEP continues to meet its obligations under the Acid Rain Program through the installation of controls, use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe CAA requires the Federal EPA to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin. The Federal EPA also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them. These concentration levels are known as NAAQS.\nEach state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (non-attainment areas). Each state must develop a SIP to bring non-attainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and maintain good air quality in attainment areas. All SIPs are submitted to the Federal EPA for approval. If a state fails to develop adequate plans, the Federal EPA develops and implements a plan. As the Federal EPA reviews the NAAQS and establishes new concentration levels, the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new SIPs. See \u201cEnvironmental Issues - Clean Air Act Requirements\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nHazardous Air Pollutants (HAP)\nThe CAA also requires the Federal EPA to investigate HAP emissions from the electric utility sector and submit a report to Congress to determine whether those emissions should be regulated. In 2011, the Federal EPA issued a rule setting Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for new and existing coal and oil-fired utility units and New Source Performance Standards for emissions from new and modified power plants. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the Federal EPA acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from electric generating units. The Federal EPA has engaged in additional rulemaking activity but the 2011 rule remains in effect.\nRegional Haze\nThe CAA establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas, including national parks, and requires states to submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these protected areas. In 2005, the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule, detailing how the CAA\u2019s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants.\nClimate Change\nAEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO2 emissions from its generating fleet and expects CO2 emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities. In 2021, AEP announced revised intermediate and long-term CO2 emission reduction goals, based on the Company\u2019s March 2021 climate impact analysis report. The intermediate goal is an 80% reduction from 2000 CO2 emission levels from AEP generating facilities by 2030; the long-term goal is net-zero CO2 emissions from AEP generating facilities by 2050. AEP\u2019s total estimated CO2 emissions in 2021 were approximately 51 million metric tons, a 70% reduction from AEP\u2019s 2000 CO2 emissions. The Company continues to work toward these goals through its integrated resource planning processes, which take into account economics, customer demand, regulations, grid reliability and resiliency.\nTo date, the Federal EPA has twice taken action to regulate CO2 emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the CAA. The Clean Power Plan was adopted in October 2015 but the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of its implementation, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans. The Clean Power Plan was repealed by the Federal EPA in 2019 and replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which changed the Federal EPA\u2019s approach to regulating CO2 emissions from existing coal-fired generating units. In January 2021, the ACE Rule was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit Court) and remanded to the Federal EPA for further proceedings. In October 2021, the U. S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and combined four separate petitions seeking review of the D.C. Circuit Court decision. Briefing is underway but management is unable to predict the outcome of that litigation. It is similarly too soon to predict how the Federal EPA will respond to the court\u2019s remand. Management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units. The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals.\nTransforming AEP\u2019s Generation Fleet\nThe electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation, driven by changing customer needs, evolving public policies, stakeholder demands, demographics, competitive offerings, technologies and commodity prices. AEP is also transforming to be more agile and customer-focused as a valued provider of energy solutions. AEP\u2019s long-term commitment to reduce CO2 emissions reflects the current direction of the company\u2019s resource plans to meet those needs. AEP set new goals in 2021 to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 (from a 2000 baseline) and to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. These goals are supported by a climate impact analysis report published in 2021. AEP\u2019s exposure to carbon regulation has been greatly reduced over the last several years. From 2000 to 2021, AEP\u2019s CO2 emissions declined 70%. In 2021, coal represented 42% of AEP\u2019s generating capacity compared with 70% in 2005. Transforming AEP\u2019s generation portfolio to include, where there is regulatory support, more renewable energy and focusing on the efficient use of energy, demand response, distributed resources and technology solutions to more efficiently manage the grid over time is part of this strategy.\nThe graph below summarizes AEP\u2019s generation capacity by resource type for the years 1999, 2005 and 2021:\n(a) Energy Efficiency/Demand Response represents avoided capacity rather than physical assets.\nRenewable Sources of Energy\nThe states AEP serves, other than Kentucky, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Tennessee, have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency, alternative energy or renewable energy sources.\nAs of December 31, 2021, AEP\u2019s regulated utilities had long-term contracts for 2,750 MWs of wind, 80 MWs of hydro, and 30 MWs of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies\u2019 customers. In addition, I&M owns four solar projects that make up I&M\u2019s 15 MW Clean Energy Solar Pilot Project, and its 20 MW St. Joseph solar facility went into operation in 2021. Management actively manages AEP\u2019s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction.\nAs of December 31, 2021, APCo has executed solar PPAs totaling 55 MWs either not eligible for or subject to regulatory pre-approval, of which 20 MWs are in operation. In 2021, APCo also executed solar PPAs for an additional 89 MWs, subject to regulatory approval including cost recovery. During the year, APCo also entered into agreements to purchase three solar facilities totaling 205 MWs and an agreement to purchase a 204 MW wind project, subject to regulatory approval including cost recovery. If approved, these projects are all expected to be online by late 2024 or early 2025.\nIn 2020, PSO received approval from the OCC and SWEPCo received approval from the APSC and LPSC to acquire the NCWF, comprised of three Oklahoma wind facilities totaling 1,484 MWs, on a fixed cost turn-key basis at completion. Both the APSC and LPSC approved the flex-up option, agreeing to acquire the Texas portion, which the PUCT denied. PSO will own 45.5% and SWEPCo will own 54.5% of the project, which will cost approximately $2 billion. The 199 MW Sundance wind facility was acquired and placed in service in April 2021 and the 287 MW Maverick wind facility was acquired and placed in service in September 2021. The 998 MW Traverse wind facility is targeted to be acquired and placed in service in the first quarter of 2022.\nThe growth of AEP\u2019s renewable generation portfolio reflects the company\u2019s strategy to diversify generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs. In addition to gradually reducing AEP\u2019s reliance on coal-fueled generating units, the growth of renewables and natural gas helps AEP to maintain a diversity of generation resources.\nThe integrated resource plans submitted to state regulatory commissions by AEP\u2019s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect AEP\u2019s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers\u2019 desire for clean energy in a carbon-constrained world. AEP has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources. Transmission assets of the AEP System interconnect approximately 20,600 MWs of renewable energy resources. AEP\u2019s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources.\nAEP Energy Supply, LLC is a holding company with several divisions, including AEP Renewables and AEP OnSite Partners.\nAEP Renewables develops, owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties throughout the United States. AEP Renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure that customers have clean, sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals. As of December 31, 2021, AEP Renewables owned projects operating in 11 states, including approximately 1,435 MWs of installed wind capacity and 165 MWs of installed solar capacity. These figures include the 2020 acquisition of an additional 10% interest, or approximately 30 MWs, of Santa Rita East wind generation located in west Texas. In October 2019, AEP Renewables entered into an agreement to construct Flat Ridge 3, a 128 MW wind farm facility in Kansas, which was placed into service in December 2021. In February 2022, AEP management announced the beginning of a process to sell all or a portion of AEP Renewables\u2019 competitive contracted renewables portfolio.\nAEP OnSite Partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge, innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities. AEP OnSite Partners targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power,\nenergy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers. AEP OnSite Partners pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers. As of December 31, 2021, AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 22 states, including approximately 161 MWs of installed solar capacity, and approximately 27 MWs of solar projects under construction.\nCompetitive Renewable Generation Facilities\n(a) Colorado, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Texas.\n(b) California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin.\n(c) Ohio and New Mexico.\nEnd Use Energy Efficiency\nBeginning in 2008, AEP ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs. These programs, commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management, were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available. Since that time, AEP's operating company\u2019s programs have reduced annual consumption by over 9.6 million MWhs and peak demand by approximately 3,099 MWs. AEP estimates that its operating companies spent approximately $1.6 billion during that period to achieve these levels.\nEnergy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves, and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings. Appropriate recovery of program costs, lost revenues, and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments. As AEP continues to transition to a cleaner, more efficient energy future, energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers.\nAEP believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a cost-effective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans.\nCorporate Governance\nIn response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEP\u2019s strategic plan, the Board of Directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coal-fired generation assets. The Board of Directors is informed of new environmental regulations and proposed environmental regulations or legislation that would significantly affect AEP. The Board\u2019s Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees AEP\u2019s annual Corporate Accountability Report, which includes information about AEP\u2019s environmental, social, governance and financial performance. AEP set CO2 emission reduction goals in 2018 after considering input from its annual corporate governance outreach effort with shareholders.\nIn February 2021, AEP announced new intermediate and long-term CO2 emission reduction goals. The intermediate goal is an 80% reduction from 2000 CO2 emission levels from AEP generating facilities by 2030; the long-term goal is net-zero CO2 emissions from AEP generating facilities by 2050. AEP has made significant\nprogress in reducing CO2 emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline. Technological advances, including advanced energy storage, advanced nuclear reactors, hydrogen production and public policies are among the factors that will determine how quickly AEP can achieve net-zero emissions while continuing to provide reliable, affordable power for customers.\nOther Environmental Issues and Matters\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites, as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites. See \u201cThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation\u201d section of Note 6 included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nEnvironmental Investments\nInvestments related to improving AEP System plants\u2019 environmental performance and compliance with environmental quality standards during 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the current estimate for 2022 are shown below. These investments include both environmental as well as other related spending. Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends and the ability to access capital. In addition to the amounts set forth below, AEP expects to make substantial investments in future years in connection with the modification and addition at generation plants\u2019 facilities for environmental quality controls. Such future investments are needed in order to comply with environmental standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2021 or have been proposed and may be adopted. Future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more stringent or in response to rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of coal combustion by-products. The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the AEP System. AEP typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions. Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP\u2019s financial condition. See \u201cEnvironmental Issues\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\n(a)Includes expenditures of the subsidiaries shown and other subsidiaries not shown. The figures reflect construction expenditures, not investments in subsidiary companies.\n(b)Estimated amounts are exclusive of debt AFUDC.\nManagement continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with environmental standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals. The following cost estimates for the years 2022 through 2028 will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in the final rules. These cost estimates will also change based on: (a) potential state rules that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) actual performance of the pollution control technologies\ninstalled, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired and replaced, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity, (g) compliance with the Federal EPA\u2019s revised coal combustion residual rules and (h) other factors. Management\u2019s current ranges of estimates of new major environmental investments beginning in 2022, exclusive of debt AFUDC, are set forth below:\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nAttracting, developing and retaining high-performing employees with the skills and experience needed to serve our customers efficiently and effectively is crucial to AEP\u2019s growth and competitiveness and is central to our long-term strategy. AEP invests in employees and continues to build a high performance and inclusive culture that inspires leadership, encourages innovative thinking and welcomes everyone.\nThe following table shows AEP\u2019s number of employees by subsidiary as of December 31, 2021:\nOf AEP\u2019s 16,688 employees, less than 1% are Traditionalists (born before 1946), approximately 24% are Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964), approximately 37% are Generation X (born 1965-1980), approximately 36% are Millennials (born 1981-1996) and approximately 2% are Generation Z (born after 1996).\nSafety\nAchieving Zero Harm means every employee returns home at the end of their shift in the same condition as when they came to work. Zero Harm is what we value most and commit to wholeheartedly. It is hard work, as it requires full focus every moment of every day. We hold ourselves accountable and we are always striving to be better. AEP has put tools, training and processes in place to strengthen our safety-first culture and mindset. AEP\u2019s focus is on learning from events and has proactive programs to prevent harm. One common industry safety metric utilized by AEP to track incidents is the Days Away/Restricted or Transferred (DART) rate. A DART event is an event that results in one or more lost days, one or more restricted days or results in an employee transferring to a different job within the company. The DART rate is a mathematical calculation (number of DART events multiplied by 200,000 work hours and divided by total YTD hours worked) that describes the number of recordable injuries per 100 full-time employees. In 2021, AEP\u2019s employee DART Rate performance worsened to 0.430 compared to the three-year historical average of 0.375. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present our teams with unprecedented distractions, both on the job and at home. Adjustments are being made to our proactive programs based on injury\ntrends and how behaviors impact work outcomes. New reinforcement materials will make sure our employees have the skills to identify and mitigate the most dangerous hazards.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nAEP is committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive environment that supports the development and advancement of all. We foster an inclusive workplace that encourages diversity of thought, culture and background and actively work to eliminate unconscious biases. We believe our workforce should generally re\ufb02ect the diversity of our customers and the communities we serve so that we may better understand how to tailor our services to meet their expectations. As of December 31, 2021, women comprised approximately 20% of AEP\u2019s workforce while approximately 19% was represented by racially or ethnically diverse employees.\nAEP has taken actions to denounce all forms of racism in the wake of the racial and social unrest across the country. To accelerate our diversity and inclusion strategy, in 2020 AEP initiated a \u201cSeize the Moment: Let\u2019s Keep the Momentum Going\u201d action plan that included candid conversations about race, Town Hall webcasts and \u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u201d discussions with the top 20 African American leaders at AEP. AEP Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Nicholas Akins joined more than 2,000 other CEOs as a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion within the workplace. Additionally, in 2021, the AEP Foundation launched a Delivering On the Dream: Social and Racial Justice grant program. The grants will play a pivotal role in addressing systemic racism by directing funds to support non-profits that are focused on outcomes that enhance social and racial justice. This new program will provide a total investment of up to $5 million, over five years, to help fund local and national organizations with operations and/or active programs within our footprint to embrace change and equity for neighbors of color, customers and employees. We also will encourage employees to make personal commitments as allies and advocates and support events that create greater collaboration within communities for equity and racial justice.\nCulture\nAEP believes in doing the right thing every time for our customers, each other and our future. AEP leaders at all levels are responsible for fostering an environment that supports a positive culture and for acting in a manner that positively models it. A high-performance culture forms the foundation for long-term success. An engaged, collaborative and empowered workforce is more likely to embrace a change mindset, drive continuous improvement, accept accountability, meet expectations, take ownership, and value personal growth. AEP is committed to driving our culture forward. Employees are given an opportunity to share their perspectives by participating in the Employee Culture Survey, administered by Gallup, Inc., that measures the progress we are making in improving our culture. In addition to engagement, the survey measures well-being and inclusiveness. In 2021, 89% of our organization participated in the survey and we continued to improve our grand mean score to remain in the top decile compared to Gallup\u2019s overall company database. Additionally in 2021, AEP received the Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award for the second consecutive year. The award recognizes organizations with engaged workplace cultures. Company executives also have candid meetings with employees to discuss our challenges, opportunities, what is going well and what can be even better.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nOne of the best ways for AEP to demonstrate our commitment to a trusting and inclusive work environment is to empower employees to form and participate in Employee Resource Groups (ERG). The ERGs at AEP include Abled and Differently-Abled Partnering Together, the Black ERG, the Asian-American ERG, the Hispanic Origin Latin American ERG, the Military Veteran ERG, the Native American ERG, the Pride Partnership and the Women at Work ERG. Our ERGs reflect the diverse makeup of our workforce and enable us to gain valuable insight into the diverse communities we serve. They also help increase engagement across AEP by providing employees with a safe space to discuss work-related issues and to develop innovative solutions. ERGs play an active role in AEP\u2019s diversity and inclusion efforts, including recruitment of new employees.\nTraining and Professional Development\nAt AEP, we are preparing our workforce for the future by providing opportunities to learn new skills and engaging higher education institutions to better prepare the next generation with the skills that we will need. AEP has training alliances with several community colleges, universities and vocational and technical schools across our service territory. We work with these institutions to develop academic programs that will prepare employees for upward mobility opportunities and to attract external job seekers interested in careers in our industry. AEP also provides a broad range of training and assistance that supports lifelong learning and transition development. This is especially important as we move closer toward a digital future that requires a more flexible, innovative and diverse workforce. AEP has robust processes to achieve this, including ongoing performance coaching, operational skills training, resources to support our commitment to environment, safety and health, job progression training, tuition assistance, and other forms of training that help employees improve their skills and become better leaders. In addition, in October 2021, AEP launched the Women in Linework (WiL) pilot program that will offer qualified participants a direct path into AEP\u2019s linework apprenticeship program. The 14-month program is seeking to address the acute lack of women in lineworker careers and will provide a training regimen along with comprehensive support and development services. WiL will initially take place in OPCo\u2019s Columbus district, with the potential for it to expand to other regions within AEP\u2019s footprint.\nIn 2021, AEP employees completed more than 719,000 hours of training in programs for which we track participation. In addition, AEP invested more than $2 million in employee education, supporting approximately 1,000 employees through our tuition reimbursement program.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAEP recognizes the importance of our employees to our success and we offer physical, mental, financial and other health, wellness and assistance programs to our employees and their families to help them thrive at home and work. We ensure the pay we offer is competitive in the marketplace by using an overall market pricing process. In addition to competitive wages, nearly all AEP employees participate in an annual incentive program that rewards outstanding performance and achievement of business goals. Our incentive compensation provides financial rewards to those who contribute to business results and meet or exceed their personal performance goals, which fosters a high-performance culture. AEP also offers employees physical and mental health programs, including medical, dental and life insurance, along with a health and well-being program to help employees and their families stay healthy and feeling their best. Additionally, AEP\u2019s retirement programs position our employees for financial stability in retirement.\nLabor Relations\nNearly one fourth of AEP\u2019s workforce is represented by labor unions. We value the relationships we have with our union represented employees and believe in a trusting, collaborative and respectful partnership. We continuously work to strengthen these relationships to ensure we have a culture that attracts and supports employees who can adapt to the rapid changes occurring in our company and industry. Our partnership with labor unions is critical to meeting the growing expectations of our customers and adapting to the challenges of rapidly changing technologies.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nAEP\u2019s Reportable Segments\nAEP\u2019s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. AEP\u2019s reportable segments are as follows:\n\u2022Vertically Integrated Utilities\n\u2022Transmission and Distribution Utilities\n\u2022AEP Transmission Holdco\n\u2022Generation & Marketing\nThe remainder of AEP\u2019s activities is presented as Corporate and Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. See Note 9 - Business Segments included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information on AEP\u2019s segments.\nVERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES\nGENERAL\nAEP\u2019s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. AEPSC, as agent for AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel procurement and power-related risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries.\nELECTRIC GENERATION\nFacilities\nAs of December 31, 2021, AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 22,500 MWs of domestic generation. See Item 2 - Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries.\nFuel Supply\nThe following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type (including wind purchase agreements), on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:\nA price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels, as well as the addition of renewable resources or retirement of traditional fossil fuel units, may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels. AEP\u2019s overall 2021 fossil fuel costs for the Vertically Integrated Utilities increased 68% on a dollar per\nMMBtu basis from 2020 due to an increase in commodity price largely due to the impact of the February 2021 Severe Winter Weather Event.\nCoal and Lignite\nAEP\u2019s Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term contracts, affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers, marketers and coal trading firms. Coal consumption in 2021 increased approximately 26% from 2020 mainly due to higher gas prices and stronger power market prices.\nManagement believes that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and quantities to operate their coal and lignite-fired units. Through subsidiaries, AEP owns, leases or controls 3,014 railcars, 343 barges, 5 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in AEP generating facilities. AEP will be selling one boat and 74 barges will be coming off lease in the first quarter of 2022 and will not be extended.\nSpot prices began 2021 at similar levels to 2020 but strengthened significantly in the back half of 2021 due to an increase in global and domestic demand. AEP\u2019s strategy for purchasing coal includes layering in supplies over time. The price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods and can occasionally cause current spot market prices to be trending opposite to the price of coal delivered. The price paid for coal delivered in 2021 decreased approximately 5.9% from 2020 mainly due to the pricing of coal supply agreements entered into in previous years.\nThe following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities\u2019 plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal and lignite purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:\n2021 2020 2019\nTotal coal and lignite delivered to the plants (in millions of tons) 18.2 19.4 30.4\nAverage cost per ton of coal and lignite delivered $ 50.76 $ 53.95 $ 45.85\nThe coal supplies at the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries. As of December 31, 2021, the Vertically Integrated Utilities\u2019 coal inventory was approximately 34 days of full load burn. While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary, the current coal inventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 27 days of full load burn.\nNatural Gas\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed approximately 108 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2021 for generating power. This represents a decrease of 4.60% from 2020. Several of AEP\u2019s natural gas-fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability. A portfolio of term, seasonal, monthly and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate. AEP\u2019s natural gas supply transactions are based on market prices.\nThe following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities\u2019 plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities. The increase in 2021 average delivered price is largely due to the impact of the February 2021 Severe Winter Weather Event.\n2021 2020 2019\nTotal natural gas delivered to the plants (in billions cubic feet) 108.0 113.1 117.0\nAverage delivered price per MMBtu of purchased natural gas $ 8.92 $ 2.14 $ 2.64\nNuclear\nI&M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant. I&M has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot, short-term and mid-term markets. I&M also continues to finance its nuclear fuel through leasing.\nFor purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of SNF, I&M completed modifications to its SNF storage pool in the early 1990\u2019s. I&M entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of SNF to permit normal operations to continue. I&M is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis. The year of expiration of each NRC Operating License is 2034 for Unit 1 and 2037 for Unit 2.\nNuclear Waste and Decommissioning\nAs the owner of the Cook Plant, I&M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely. The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the SNF disposal program. The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2021. The estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was $2.2 billion in 2021 non-discounted dollars, with additional ongoing estimated costs of $7 million per year for post decommissioning storage of SNF and an eventual estimated cost of $33 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility, also in 2021 non-discounted dollars. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately $3.5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. The balance of funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns. The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the:\n\u2022Escalation of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation and the cost of energy).\n\u2022Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning.\n\u2022Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies.\n\u2022Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities.\n\u2022Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of SNF.\nAccordingly, management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current projections. AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections. See the \u201cNuclear Contingencies\u201d section of Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning.\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste\nThe Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste rests with the individual states. Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials. Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available. I&M cannot predict when such a site may be available. However, the states of Utah and Texas have licensed low-level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low-level radioactive waste from Michigan waste generators. There is currently no set date limiting I&M\u2019s access to either of these facilities. The Cook Plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low-level radioactive waste. In the event that low-level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable, it can be stored onsite at this facility.\nCounterparty Risk Management\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants. As a result, counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions. As of December 31, 2021, counterparties posted approximately $10 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately $210 million with counterparties and exchanges). Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily. See the \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nCertain Power Agreements\nI&M\nThe UPA between AEGCo and I&M, dated March 31, 1982 (the I&M Power Agreement), provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant. Whether or not power is available from AEGCo, I&M is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M). The I&M Power Agreement will continue in effect until the debt obligations of AEGCo secured by the Rockport Plant have been satisfied and discharged (currently expected to be December 2028).\nPursuant to an assignment between I&M and KPCo, and a UPA between AEGCo and KPCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30% of the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant. KPCo has agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts that I&M would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the UPA between AEGCo and I&M for such entitlement. The KPCo UPA expires in December 2022.\nOVEC\nAEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC. The aggregate equity participation of AEP in OVEC is 43.47%. Parent owns 39.17% and OPCo owns 4.3%. Under the Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA), which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each, the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. The ICPA terminates in June 2040. The proceeds from charges by OVEC to sponsoring companies under the ICPA based on their power participation ratios are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs. OVEC\u2019s Board of Directors, as elected by AEP and nonaffiliated owners, has authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests, with resulting expenses (including for related debt and interest thereon) included in charges under the ICPA. OVEC financed capital expenditures in excess of $1 billion in connection with flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal\nlandfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances, including tax-advantaged debt issuances. Both OVEC generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in-service. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information.\nELECTRIC DELIVERY\nGeneral\nOther than AEGCo, AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power. See Item 2 - Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines. Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories. These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC. See Item 1. Business - Vertically Integrated Utilities - Regulation - Rates. The FERC regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts. The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, principles, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and SPP, and as approved by the FERC. See Item 1. Business - Vertically Integrated Utilities - Regulation - FERC. As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies.\nOther than AEGCo, AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas. In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory. These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates. In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business. For a discussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item 1. Business - Vertically Integrated Utilities - Competition.\nTransmission Agreement\nAPCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA. OPCo, which is a subsidiary in AEP\u2019s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment that provides transmission service under the PJM OATT, is also a party to the TA. The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM. The TA has been approved by the FERC.\nTransmission Coordination Agreement and Open Access Transmission Tariff\nPSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA. Under the TCA, a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of: (a) overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement, including the performance of transmission planning studies, (b) the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and (c) compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff. Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement. The TCA also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT. These allocations have been determined by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP.\nRegional Transmission Organizations\nAEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM, and PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP (both FERC-approved RTOs). RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to\nprovide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.\nREGULATION\nGeneral\nAEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries\u2019 retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional cost-based regulation by the state utility commissions. AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions. I&M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook Plant. AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of, much of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which is administered by the FERC.\nRates\nHistorically, state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service. A utility\u2019s cost-of-service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of: (a) a utility\u2019s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility\u2019s level of investment. Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers. Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time.\nPublic utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in-service. Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery. Given long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets, management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow. AEP representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative rate-making options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process. These options include pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates.\nThe rates of AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service). Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility\u2019s rates and tariffs. Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes.\nThe following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate. Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction. See Note 4 - Rate Matters included in the 2021 Annual Report for more information regarding pending rate matters.\nIndiana\nI&M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a forecasted cost-of-service basis. Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism.\nOklahoma\nPSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC. PSO\u2019s rates are set on a cost-of-service basis. Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded through a fuel adjustment clause.\nVirginia\nAPCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates approved by the Virginia SCC. Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel cost recovery mechanism. In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.\nWest Virginia\nAPCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis. West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through the ENEC which trues-up to actual expenses. In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through surcharges.\nFERC\nThe FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects. The FERC regulations require AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and AEP has approved cost-based formula transmission rates on file at the FERC. The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers. In addition, the FERC regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by: (a) approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities at cost-based rates and (b) granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices. AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have market-based rate authority from the FERC, under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place. The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities, directly or through an RTO, to file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility\u2019s own uses of its transmission system. The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities\u2019 transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility\u2019s marketing employees. Additionally, the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC.\nThe FERC oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility transmission assets. AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM. PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP.\nThe FERC has jurisdiction over certain issuances of securities of most of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition of securities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.\nCOMPETITION\nOther than AEGCo, AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries generate, transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories. These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC, and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities. Other than AEGCo, AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.\nAEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas. The primary factors in such competition are price, reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power. With respect to competing generators and self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they currently maintain a competitive position.\nChanges in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production. The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive. The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP\u2019s competitiveness.\nSEASONALITY\nThe consumption of electric power is generally seasonal. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP\u2019s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters. In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP\u2019s results of operations. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP\u2019s results of operations.\nTRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES\nGENERAL\nThis segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo. OPCo is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1,515,000 retail customers in Ohio. OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve standard service offer customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load. AEP Texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1,082,000 retail customers through REPs in west, central and southern Texas.\nAEP\u2019s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power. See Item 2 - Properties, for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines. Transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP\u2019s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories. These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for AEP Texas and by the PUCO and the FERC for OPCo. The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions. As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies.\nAEP\u2019s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas. In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the\nexclusive right to provide electric service. These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates. In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.\nThe use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC. In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas, AEP\u2019s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies through RTOs.\nTransmission Agreement\nOPCo owns and operates transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT; OPCo is a party to the TA with other utility subsidiary affiliates. The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM. The TA has been approved by the FERC.\nRegional Transmission Organizations\nOPCo is a member of PJM, a FERC-approved RTO. RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not. AEP Texas is a member of ERCOT.\nREGULATION\nOPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates approved by the PUCO or by the FERC. AEP Texas sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Cost of Services (TCOS) and Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) filings. AEP Texas may file interim TCOS filings semi-annually and DCRF filings annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital. Transmission and distribution rates are established on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service. The cost-of-service generally reflects operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. Utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of: (a) a utility\u2019s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility\u2019s level of investment.\nFERC\nThe FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters. The FERC regulations require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and it has approved cost-based formula transmission rates on file at the FERC. The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers. The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility\u2019s own uses of its transmission system. The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities\u2019 transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility\u2019s marketing employees. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system. Additionally, the transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards as set forth by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC.\nSEASONALITY\nThe delivery of electric power is generally seasonal. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months. The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP\u2019s transmission and distribution facilities. In addition, AEP transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. In Texas, where there is residential decoupling, unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP\u2019s results of operations. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP\u2019s results of operations.\nAEP TRANSMISSION HOLDCO\nGENERAL\nAEPTHCo is a holding company for (a) AEPTCo, which is the direct holding company for the State Transcos and (b) AEP\u2019s Transmission Joint Ventures.\nAEPTCo\nAEPTCo wholly owns the State Transcos which are independent of, but respectively overlay, the following AEP electric utility operating companies: APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. The State Transcos develop, own, operate and maintain their respective transmission assets. Assets of the State Transcos interconnect to transmission facilities owned by the aforementioned operating companies and nonaffiliated transmission owners within the footprints of PJM, MISO and SPP. APTCo, IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo and WVTCo are located within PJM. IMTCo also owns portions of the Greentown station assets located in MISO. OKTCo and SWTCo are located within SPP.\nIMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo and WVTCo own and operate transmission assets in their respective jurisdictions. The Virginia SCC and WVPSC granted consent for APCo and APTCo to enter into a joint license agreement that will support APTCo investment in the state of Tennessee. SWTCo does not currently own or operate transmission assets.\nThe State Transcos are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems. The State Transcos establish transmission rates each year through formula rate filings with the FERC. The rate filings calculate the revenue requirement needed to cover the costs of operation and debt service and to earn an allowed ROE. These rates are then included in an OATT for PJM, MISO and SPP.\nThe State Transcos own, operate, maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability, grid security, safety, reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources and new wholesale customers, as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets. A key part of AEP\u2019s business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP System as needed to maintain reliability.\nThe State Transcos provide the capability to build, replace and upgrade existing facilities. As of December 31, 2021, the State Transcos had $11.5 billion of transmission and other assets in-service with plans to construct approximately $3.5 billion of additional transmission assets, excluding CWIP, through 2024. Additional investment in transmission infrastructure is needed within PJM and SPP to maintain the required level of grid reliability, resiliency, security and efficiency and to address an aging transmission infrastructure. Additional transmission facilities will be needed based on changes in generating resources, such as wind or solar projects, generation additions or retirements and additional new customer interconnections. The State Transcos will continue their investment to enhance physical and cyber security of assets, and are also investing in improving the telecommunication network that supports the operation and control of the grid.\nIn October 2021, AEP entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to sell KTCo to Liberty Utilities. Subject to satisfaction of closing conditions and receipt of regulatory approvals, the sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information\nAEPTHCO JOINT VENTURE INITIATIVES\nAEP has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing, building and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in North America (Transmission Joint Ventures).\nThe Transmission Joint Ventures currently include:\n(a)ETT is undertaking multiple projects and the completion dates will vary for those projects. ETT\u2019s investment in completed and active projects in ERCOT is expected to be $3.9 billion. Future projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n(b)In May 2020, Pioneer received FERC approval authorizing an ROE of 10.02% (10.52% inclusive of the RTO incentive adder of 0.5%).\n(c)The ROE represents the weighted-average approved ROE based on the costs of two projects developed by Transource Missouri; the $64 million Iatan-Nashua project (10.3%) and the $247 million Sibley-Nebraska City project (11.3%).\n(d)AEP owns 86.5% of Transource Missouri, Transource West Virginia, Transource Maryland, Transource Pennsylvania and Transource Oklahoma through its ownership interest in Transource Energy, LLC (Transource). Transource is a joint venture with AEPTHCo and Evergy, Inc. formed to pursue competitive transmission projects. AEPTHCo and Evergy, Inc. own 86.5% and 13.5% of Transource, respectively.\n(e)See \u201cIndependence Energy Connection Project\u201d section below for additional information.\n(f)In 2016, Transource Kansas received approval from the FERC authorizing an ROE of 9.8% (10.3% inclusive of the RTO incentive adder of 0.5%) for future competitive transmission projects in SPP. In October 2020, Transource was awarded the Sooner-Wekiwa project by SPP and the project was assigned to Transource Kansas. In November 2020, Transource Kansas was renamed Transource Oklahoma. The project is expected to go in-service in 2026.\nTransource Missouri, Transource West Virginia, Transource Maryland, Transource Pennsylvania and Transource Oklahoma are consolidated joint ventures by AEP. All other joint ventures in the table above are not consolidated by AEP. AEP\u2019s joint ventures do not have employees. Business services for the joint ventures are provided by AEPSC and other AEP subsidiaries and the joint venture partners. In 2021, approximately 438 AEPSC employees and 256 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures.\nIndependence Energy Connection Project\nIn 2016, PJM approved the Independence Energy Connection Project (IEC) and included it in its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan to alleviate congestion. Transource Energy owns the IEC, which is located in Maryland and Pennsylvania. In June 2020, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct the portion of the IEC in Maryland. In May 2021, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PA PUC) denied the IEC certificate for siting and construction of the portion in Pennsylvania. Transource Energy has appealed the PA PUC ruling in Pennsylvania state court and challenged the ruling before the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The case before the state court is pending and the case before the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania is currently suspended, pending the outcome of the case in the Pennsylvania state court.\nIn September 2021, PJM notified Transource Energy that the IEC was suspended to allow for the regulatory and related appeals process to proceed in an orderly manner without breaching milestone dates in the project agreement. PJM stated that the IEC has not been cancelled and remains necessary to alleviate congestion. As of December 31, 2021, AEP\u2019s share of IEC capital expenditures was approximately $81 million. The FERC has previously granted abandonment benefits for this project, allowing the full recovery of prudently incurred costs if the project is cancelled for reasons outside the control of Transource Energy. If any of the IEC costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nREGULATION\nThe State Transcos and the Transmission Joint Ventures located outside of ERCOT establish transmission rates annually through forward-looking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERC-approved implementation protocols. The protocols include a transparent, formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently-incurred and reasonably calculated. The IMTCo-owned Greentown station assets acquired from Duke Energy Indiana, LLC in December 2018 are located in MISO. IMTCo utilizes a historic cost recovery model to recover MISO assets.\nThe State Transcos\u2019 and the Transmission Joint Ventures\u2019 (where applicable) rates are included in the respective OATT for PJM and SPP. An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider\u2019s transmission system. The FERC requires transmission providers such as PJM and SPP to offer transmission service to all eligible customers (for example, load-serving entities, power marketers, generators and customers) on a non-discriminatory basis.\nThe FERC-approved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with the FERC. The formula rates establish rates for a one-year period based on the current projects in-service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe. The formula rates also include a true-up calculation for the previous year\u2019s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner\u2019s ATRR. PJM and SPP pay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the PJM and SPP OATTs, based on the terms and conditions in the respective OATT for the service taken. Additionally, the State Transcos are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC.\nManagement continues to monitor the FERC\u2019s 2019 Notice of Inquiry regarding base ROE policy, the FERC\u2019s 2020 and 2021 supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) regarding transmission incentives policy, and various other matters pending before the FERC with the potential to affect the transmission ROE methodology.\nIn April 2021, the FERC issued a supplemental NOPR proposing to modify its incentive for transmission owners that join RTOs (RTO Incentive). Under the supplemental NOPR, the RTO Incentive would be modified such that a utility would only be eligible for the RTO Incentive for the first three years after the utility joins a FERC-approved Transmission Organization. This is a significant departure from a previous NOPR issued in 2020 seeking to increase the RTO Incentive from 50 basis points to 100 basis points. The supplemental NOPR also required utilities\nthat have received the RTO Incentive for three or more years to submit, within 30 days of the effective date of a final rule, a compliance filing to eliminate the incentive from its tariff prospectively. The supplemental NOPR was subject to a 60 day comment period followed by a 30 day period for reply comments. In July 2021, AEP submitted reply comments. AEP is awaiting a final rule from the FERC.\nIn July 2021, the FERC issued an order denying Dayton Power and Light\u2019s request for a 50 basis point RTO incentive on the basis that its RTO participation was not voluntary, but rather is required by Ohio law. This precedent could have an impact on AEP\u2019s transmission owning subsidiaries.\nIn 2019, the FERC approved settlement agreements establishing base ROEs of 9.85% (10.35% inclusive of RTO Incentive adder of 0.5%) and 10% (10.5% inclusive of RTO Incentive adder of 0.5%) for AEP\u2019s PJM and SPP transmission-owning subsidiaries, respectively. In 2020, the FERC determined the base ROE for MISO\u2019s transmission owning subsidiaries should be 10.02% (10.52% inclusive of RTO Incentive adder of 0.5%).\nIf the FERC modifies its RTO Incentive policy, it would be applied, as applicable, to AEP\u2019s PJM, SPP and MISO transmission owning subsidiaries on a prospective basis, and could affect future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Based on management\u2019s preliminary estimates, if a final rule is adopted consistent with the April 2021 supplemental NOPR, it could reduce AEP\u2019s pretax income by approximately $55 million to $70 million on an annual basis.\nIn the annual rate base filings described above, the State Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of $8.4 billion, $7.0 billion and $5.9 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total filed transmission revenue requirements, including prior year over/under-recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges were $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion and $992 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe rates of ETT, which is located in ERCOT, are determined by the PUCT. ETT sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Cost of Services (TCOS) filings. ETT may file interim TCOS filings semi-annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital.\nThe Transmission Joint Ventures have approved ROEs ranging from 9.6% to 12.8% based on equity capital structures ranging from 40% to 60%.\nGENERATION & MARKETING\nGENERAL\nThe AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of a wholesale energy trading and marketing business, a retail supply and energy management business and competitive generating assets.\nAEP Energy Supply, LLC is a holding company with several divisions, including AEP Renewables and AEP OnSite Partners.\nAEP Renewables develops, owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties throughout the United States. AEP Renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure that customers have clean, sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals. As of December 31, 2021, AEP Renewables owned projects operating in 11 states, including approximately 1,435 MWs of installed wind capacity and 165 MWs of installed solar capacity. In October 2019, AEP Renewables entered into an agreement to construct Flat Ridge 3, a wind farm in Kansas. The 128 MW facility was placed into service in December 2021. In November 2020, AEP Renewables signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire 75% of the Dry Lake Solar Project, a 100 MW solar facility in southern Nevada. This facility was placed into service in May 2021. In February 2022, AEP management announced the beginning of a process to sell all or a portion of AEP Renewables\u2019 competitive contracted renewables portfolio.\nAEP OnSite Partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge, innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities. AEP OnSite Partners targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers. AEP OnSite Partners pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers. As of December 31, 2021, AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 22 states, including approximately 161 MWs of installed solar capacity, and approximately 27 MWs of solar projects under construction.\nWith respect to the wholesale energy trading and marketing business, AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries enter into short-term and long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in ERCOT, SPP, MISO and PJM. These subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power, natural gas and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities. These activities primarily involve the purchase-and-sale of electricity (and to a lesser extent, natural gas and emissions allowances) under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices. These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options. The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts. These transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges.\nWith respect to the retail supply and energy management business, AEP Energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity and/or natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. AEP Energy provides various energy solutions in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C. AEP Energy had approximately 552,000 customer accounts as of December 31, 2021.\nThe primary fossil generation subsidiary in the Generation & Marketing segment is AGR. As of December 31, 2021, AGR owns the 595 MW Cardinal Plant which is operated by a nonaffiliated electric cooperative. Other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets. See Item 2 - Properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the Generation & Marketing segment. AGR is a competitive generation subsidiary.\nREGULATION\nAGR is a public utility under the Federal Power Act, and is subject to the FERC\u2019s exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and\nancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable. The FERC granted AGR market-based rate authority in December 2013. The FERC\u2019s jurisdiction over rate-making also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of AGR and set cost-based rates if the FERC subsequently determines that it can exercise market power, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. Periodically, AGR is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet the FERC\u2019s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for market-based rates. Other matters subject to the FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, review of mergers, and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility.\nSpecific operations of AGR are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal, state, regional and local agencies, including federal and state environmental protection agencies. AGR is also regulated by the PUCT for transactions inside ERCOT. Additionally, AGR is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC.\nCOMPETITION\nThe AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power, capacity and ancillary services. The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation. Because AGR\u2019s remaining generation is coal-fired, lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation. Other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation, transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities, inoperability or inefficiencies, outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities.\nTechnology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment. AGR also competes with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas. The primary factors in such competition are price, unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power.\nChanges in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production. The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AGR\u2019s competitiveness. The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.\nThis segment\u2019s retail operations provide competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and Washington, D.C. Each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market, and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition. Sustained low natural gas and power prices, low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business.\nThis segment also engages in procuring and selling output from renewable generation sources under long-term contracts to creditworthy counterparties. New sources are not acquired without first securing a long-term placement of such power. Existing sources do not face competitive exposure. Competitive nonaffiliated suppliers of renewable or other generation could limit opportunities for future transactions for new sources and related output contracts.\nSEASONALITY\nThe consumption of electric power is generally seasonal. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months. The pattern of this fluctuation may change.\nFuel Supply\nThe following table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Generation & Marketing segment:\n2021 2020 2019\nCoal 38% 46% 64%\nRenewables 62% 54% 36%\nCoal and Consumables\nAGR procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms. As contracts expire, they are replaced, as needed, with contracts at market prices. Coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements.\nManagement believes that AGR will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate its coal-fired unit. AGR, through its contracts with third-party transporters, has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facility. AGR plants consumed 1.2 million tons of coal in 2021.\nThe coal supplies at AGR\u2019s plant vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, coal quality, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries. AGR aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plant in the range of 20 to 60 days of full load burn. As of December 31, 2021, the coal inventory of AGR was within the target range.\nCounterparty Risk Management\nCounterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions. As of December 31, 2021, counterparties posted approximately $266 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately $113 million with counterparties and exchanges). Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily. See the \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nCertain Power Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2021, the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 1,435 MWs of company-owned domestic wind power facilities and 148 MWs of domestic wind power from long-term purchase power agreements. Additional long term purchased power agreements have been entered into for 669 MWs of wind and 1,230 MWs of solar capacity which are all seeking permits or under construction. These agreements are all contingent on completion of construction which is expected by the end of 2024.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following persons are executive officers of AEP.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONS\nAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP\u2019s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of additional transmission and renewable generation facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure, installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives. AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions. If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments. This would cause financial results to be diminished.\nRegulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP\u2019s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. In certain instances, AEP\u2019s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval. AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.\nIf regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted. Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved. See Note 4 - Rate Matters included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nAEP\u2019s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants)\nA significant portion of AEP\u2019s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities. FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction. If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP\u2019s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted. Management believes AEP\u2019s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities. However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.\nCertain elements of AEP\u2019s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)\nAEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC. The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates. All aspects of AEP\u2019s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the\nactual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative. In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true-up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP\u2019s formula rate implementation protocols. If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP\u2019s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.\nInquiries related to rates of return, as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities, are ongoing in other proceedings at the FERC. The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEP\u2019s formula rates. If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds, in any future cases related to its formula rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nEnd-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.\nAEP faces risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities. A key component of AEP's growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities. As part of these operations AEP must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions. Should AEP be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third-parties could have similar results.\nChanges in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology. Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it. Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery. These developments can challenge AEP\u2019s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers. Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.\nAEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP\u2019s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, non-performance by equipment and other third-party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP\u2019s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur. In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.\nAEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nI&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,296 MWs, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System. AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:\n\u2022The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF.\n\u2022Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.\n\u2022Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).\n\u2022Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.\nThere can be no assurance that I&M\u2019s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants. In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.\nCosts associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities. Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs. The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.\nAEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)\nResults are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets. The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues. Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design. In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights. As members of these RTOs, AEP\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation among existing members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.\nAEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)\nOwners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner. If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.\nA substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers. As of December 31, 2021, AEP Texas did business with approximately 123 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments. AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. In 2021, AEP Texas\u2019 three largest REPs accounted for 43% of its operating revenue. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.\nOhio House Bill 6 (HB 6), which provides for beneficial cost recovery for OPCo and for plants owned by OVEC, has come under public scrutiny. (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts, OVEC\u2019s coal-fired generating units and energy efficiency measures. AEP and OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB\n6. The outcome of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office investigation and its impact on HB 6 is not known. If certain provisions of HB 6 were to be eliminated, it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted. To the extent that OPCo is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by HB 6, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. In addition, the impact of continued public scrutiny of HB 6 is not known, and may have an adverse impact on AEP and OPCo, including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders. AEP is a defendant in current litigation relating to HB6 and AEP or OPCo may be involved in future litigation.\nRISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKS\nAEP\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe global 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic is an evolving situation that has caused and could continue to lead to extended disruption of economic activity in AEP\u2019s markets. COVID-19 could negatively affect AEP\u2019s ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets, its ability to access capital markets and results of operations. AEP currently cannot estimate the potential impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows caused by COVID-19, which will depend on future developments and which are highly uncertain at this time. See Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview for additional information on COVID-19.\nAEP\u2019s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)\nPerformance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:\n\u2022Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.\n\u2022Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.\n\u2022Labor disputes.\n\u2022Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.\n\u2022Information technology failure that impairs AEP\u2019s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.\n\u2022Information technology failure that affects AEP\u2019s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP\u2019s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.\n\u2022Supply chain disruptions and inflation.\n\u2022Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.\n\u2022Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.\n\u2022Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.\nPhysical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP\u2019s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading. AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber-attack. In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is\nsubject to electronic theft or loss.\nA security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses\u2019 physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system. AEP and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with ransomware theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data. A successful cyber-attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP\u2019s reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. AEP and its third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of remote access across the AEP System, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks. However, the AEP cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future.\nThe rate of taxes imposed on AEP could change. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP is subject to income taxation at the federal level and by certain states and municipalities. In determining AEP\u2019s income tax liability for these jurisdictions, management monitors changes to the applicable tax laws and related regulations. While management believes it is in compliance with current prevailing laws, one or more taxing jurisdictions could seek to impose incremental or new taxes on the company. In addition, the Biden administration has proposed and congressional leaders have considered significant changes in tax law and regulations that could result in additional federal income taxes being imposed on AEP. Any adverse developments in these laws or regulations, including legislative changes, judicial holdings or administrative interpretations, could have a material and adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.\nIf AEP is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows or proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries such as the planned sale of KPCo and KTCo, and insurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile. Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP\u2019s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness. Certain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels. Any planned sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries, may not occur for any number of reasons beyond our control, including regulatory approval on terms that are acceptable. If sources of capital for AEP are reduced and/or expected sale proceeds do not become available, capital costs could increase materially. Restricted access to capital or insurance markets and/or increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\nShareholder activism could cause AEP to incur significant expense, hinder execution of AEP\u2019s business strategy and impact AEP\u2019s stock price. (Applies to all Registrants)\nShareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and AEP\u2019s board\u2019s attention and resources from AEP\u2019s business. Additionally, such\nshareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEP\u2019s future, adversely affect AEP\u2019s relationships with its employees, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, AEP may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors. AEP\u2019s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.\nThe announced phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing. (Applies to all Registrants)\nA portion of the Registrants\u2019 indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for deposits of U.S. dollars. On November 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that LIBOR would be phased out completely by June 20, 2023 and replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") and certain LIBOR maturities have already been phased out. However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from U.S. dollar LIBOR and the SOFR market is not yet fully developed. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could cause interest rates to increase. If sources of capital for the Registrants are reduced, capital costs could increase materially. Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition and/or liquidity.\nDowngrades in AEP\u2019s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP\u2019s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations. AEP\u2019s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive. If AEP\u2019s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP\u2019s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\nAEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)\nAEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own. Their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries, primarily their regulated utilities, and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from them. Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo) to provide them with funds for their payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments. Payments to AEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations. AEP and AEPTCo indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.\nAEP\u2019s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)\nElectric power consumption is generally seasonal. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP\u2019s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.\nFurther, deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause, including international tariffs, generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues. As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\nVolatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning. (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)\nThe costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of AEP\u2019s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.\nAdditionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.\nSupply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact our operations and corporate strategy. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP\u2019s operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure the equipment, materials and other resources necessary to build and provide services in a safe and reliable manner. The delivery of components, materials, equipment and other resources that are critical to our business operations and corporate strategy has been restricted by the current domestic and global supply chain upheaval. This has resulted in the shortage of critical items. These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact both our business operations and corporate strategy. The constraints in the supply chain could restrict the availability and delay the construction, maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support normal operations or are required to execute on our corporate strategy for continued capital investment in utility equipment. These disruptions and constraints could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP\u2019s financial condition.\nSupply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment and other needed commodities and these inflationary increases may continue in the future. While inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years, during 2021, the economy in the United States encountered a material level of inflation. The impact of COVID-19 continues to increase uncertainty in the outlook of near-term economic activity, including whether inflation will continue and at what rate. AEP typically recovers increases in capital expenses from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions. Failure to recover increased capital costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP\u2019s financial condition. Increases in inflation raises our costs for labor, materials and services, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial condition.\nAEP\u2019s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand. (Applies to all Registrants)\nGrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side\nmanagement goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity, including changes due to public health considerations.\nCertain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption. Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, employee reaction to comply with potential COVID-19 vaccination or testing mandates, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include potential higher rates of existing employee departures, lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, safety costs and costs of compliance with potential COVID-19 vaccination or testing mandates, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business. If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.\nChanges in the price of commodities, the cost of procuring fuel, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP\u2019s cost of producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nAEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel (including the cost to procure coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel. AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts. The inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life, and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover such costs. Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances. AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures. Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond. Additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions. If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs. AEP\u2019s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.\nPrices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past. Changes in the cost of fuel, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\nIn addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material. As a result, as those transactions are marked-to-market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nAEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)\nClimate change creates physical and financial risk. Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as fires. Customers\u2019 energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers\u2019 energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.\nIncreased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load. Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues. AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP\u2019s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP\u2019s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.\nSevere weather and weather-related events impact AEP\u2019s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur. To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase, AEP\u2019s cost of providing service will increase, including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts, and these costs may not be recoverable. Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units. A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP\u2019s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy. AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.\nTo the extent climate change impacts a region\u2019s economic health, it may also impact revenues. AEP\u2019s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves. The price of energy, as a factor in a region\u2019s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.\nManagement cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP\u2019s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2021 Annual Report. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\nDisruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services. (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third-parties. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nManagement is unable to predict the course, results or impact, if any, of current or future litigation or investigations relating to the extreme winter weather in Texas in February 2021. (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAs a result of the February 2021 severe winter weather in Texas which caused a shortage of electric generation, ERCOT instructed AEP Texas and other Texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained large-scale outage and prevent long-term damage to the electric system. At its peak, approximately 468,000 (44%) AEP Texas customers were without power.\nAEP Texas and other AEP entities are named in approximately 100 lawsuits generally alleging the failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and updating their generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to prevent cold weather failures and other related negligence. The complaints seek monetary damages among other forms of relief. In February 2021, AEP Texas received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Attorney General of Texas requesting, among other data, information about its communications to and from ERCOT, PUCT, retail electric providers, utilities, or power generation companies, concerning power outages related to the February 2021 winter storm. The company responded to the Civil Investigative Demand in March 2021. Management is unable to predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact, if any, on future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nHazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP\u2019s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks. The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP\u2019s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.\nAEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues. (Applies to AEPTCo)\nAEPTCo\u2019s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System. Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo\u2019s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2021, its affiliates were responsible for approximately 79% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.\nMost of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates. (Applies to AEPTCo)\nAEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located. Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations. The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property. AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.\nCompliance with legislative and regulatory requirements may lead to increased costs and result in penalties. (Applies to all Registrants)\nBusiness activities of electric utilities and related companies are heavily regulated, primarily through national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters. Many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. Registrants are subject to the jurisdiction of many federal and state agencies, including the FERC, NERC, Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Federal EPA, NRC, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the SEC and the United States Department of Justice which may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to AEP\u2019s business, which could have a material adverse effect on financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase AEP\u2019s operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services AEP offers, or result in adverse publicity and harm AEP\u2019s reputation.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWER\nCosts of compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nOperations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety. A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or CCR) resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses. Compliance with these legal requirements (including any new and more stringent application of existing CCR regulations) requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission limits, CCR waste discharge and/or discharge disposal obligations are tightened, more extensive operating and/or permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances or facilities become regulated. Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants. Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.\nRegulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nTo date, federal court decisions have blocked Federal EPA\u2019s attempts to regulate CO2 emissions from existing utility units. While there are no federal CO2 regulations in effect at present, the current administration has announced addressing climate change as a policy priority. Costs of compliance with the environmental regulation of CO2 emissions, if any, could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition and/or could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. Although AEP typically recovers environmental expenditures, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.\nCourts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nIn the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants. In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants\u2019 power plants constitute a public nuisance. The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief. If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP\u2019s existing coal-fired power plants could be required, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP\u2019s commitments to supply power to AEP customers. This could have a material impact on revenues. In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations. Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition. Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.\nCommodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nAEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP\u2019s trading portfolio. To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.\nAEP\u2019s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements. To the extent that AEP\u2019s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.\nIn connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts. These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements. If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.\nParties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP\u2019s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances, renewable energy credits and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations. AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP\u2019s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses. Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.\nAEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control. If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP\u2019s power. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale. This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks. If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power. If a region\u2019s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP\u2019s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If\nrestrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.\nThe FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales. Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable. Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.\nOVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support. (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo)\nAEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it. Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $492 million through the ICPA. Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC\u2019s outstanding debt through the ICPA and if OVEC\u2019s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%.",

The greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the AEP System has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority. The rights of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business. Minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist, but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties. AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them, if necessary, to acquire, perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations.\nSYSTEM TRANSMISSION LINES AND FACILITY SITING\nLaws in the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities and/or routes of high-voltage transmission lines. AEP has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which AEP\u2019s operating companies have sought to acquire rights-of-way through condemnation. These proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years.\nCONSTRUCTION PROGRAM\nWith input from its state utility commissions, the AEP System continuously assesses the adequacy of its transmission, distribution, generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers. In this assessment process, assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified, as appropriate. AEP forecasts approximately $7.6 billion of construction expenditures for 2022. Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain issues, weather, legal reviews and the ability to access capital. See the \u201cBudgeted Capital Expenditures\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.\nPOTENTIAL UNINSURED LOSSES\nSome potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities, including liabilities relating to damage to AEP\u2019s generation plants and costs of replacement power. Unless allowed to be recovered through rates, future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could reduce net income and impact the financial conditions of AEP and other AEP System companies.

AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES\nINDEX OF ANNUAL REPORTS\nAMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nCompany Overview\nAEP is one of the largest investor-owned electric public utility holding companies in the United States. AEP\u2019s electric utility operating companies provide generation, transmission and distribution services to more than five million retail customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries operate an extensive portfolio of assets including:\n\u2022Approximately 224,000 circuit miles of distribution lines that deliver electricity to 5.5 million customers.\n\u2022Approximately 40,000 circuit miles of transmission lines, including approximately 2,200 circuit miles of 765 kV lines, the backbone of the electric interconnection grid in the eastern United States.\n\u2022Approximately 22,500 MWs of regulated owned generating capacity and approximately 4,600 MWs of regulated PPA capacity in 3 RTOs as of December 31, 2021, one of the largest complements of generation in the United States.\nCOVID-19\nIn 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its rapid spread around the world and throughout the United States prompted many countries, including the United States, to institute restrictions on travel, public gatherings and certain business operations. These restrictions significantly disrupted economic activity in AEP\u2019s service territory and resulted in reduced demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers. In 2021, weather-normalized customer demand improved from the pandemic levels experienced in 2020.\nDuring 2020, AEP\u2019s electric operating companies informed both retail customers and state regulators that disconnections for non-payment were temporarily suspended. Shortly thereafter, AEP\u2019s state regulators also imposed temporary moratoria on customary disconnection practices. AEP\u2019s electric operating companies have since resumed customary disconnection practices in all regulated jurisdictions.\nAEP has been and continues to be proactive in engaging with customers to collect payments or establish payment arrangements for outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2021, AEP currently does not expect accounts receivable aging to have a material adverse impact on the Registrants\u2019 allowance for uncollectible accounts based on considerations of the COVID-19 impacts and past trends during times of economic instability. Management continues to monitor developments that could have an impact on customer collections.\nThe Registrants continue to take steps to mitigate the potential risks to customers, suppliers and employees posed by the spread of COVID-19 variants. In the second quarter of 2021, management announced a Future of Work model designating employees as: (a) On-Site employees, (b) Hybrid employees and (c) Remote employees. Management began transitioning On-Site employees back to their AEP workplace and Hybrid employees with set schedules back to their AEP workplace in October 2021. Remote employees began transitioning back to their AEP workplace in November 2021 on an as-needed basis. As of December 31, 2021, there has been no material adverse impact to the Registrants\u2019 business operations and customer service as a result of COVID-19 variants or the Future of Work model. Management will continue to review and modify plans as conditions change.\nIn 2021, the Registrants have experienced certain supply chain disruptions driven by several factors including staffing and travel issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, increased demand due to the economic recovery from the pandemic, labor shortages in certain trades and shortages in the availability of certain raw materials. These supply chain disruptions have not had a material impact on the Registrants net income, cash flows and financial condition, but have extended lead times for certain goods and services. Management has implemented risk mitigation strategies in an attempt to mitigate the impacts of these supply chain disruptions. However, a prolonged continuation or a future increase in the severity of supply chain disruptions could impact the cost of certain goods and services and extend lead times which could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nCustomer Demand\nAEP\u2019s weather-normalized retail sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 2.1% from the year ended December 31, 2020. Weather-normalized residential sales decreased 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 4.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. AEP\u2019s 2021 industrial sales volumes increased 3.7% compared to 2020. The growth in industrial sales was spread across many industries.\nIn 2022, AEP anticipates weather-normalized retail sales volumes will increase by 1.5%. The industrial class is expected to increase by 5.5% in 2022, while weather-normalized residential sales volumes are projected to decrease by 0.5%. Finally, AEP projects weather-normalized commercial sales volumes to decrease by 0.8%.\n(a)Percentage change for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(b)Forecasted percentage change for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRegulatory Matters\nAEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries are involved in rate and regulatory proceedings at the FERC and their state commissions. Depending on the outcomes, these rate and regulatory proceedings can have a material impact on results of operations, cash flows and possibly financial condition. AEP is currently involved in the following key proceedings. See Note 4 - Rate Matters for additional information.\n\u20222017-2019 Virginia Triennial Review - In November 2020, the Virginia SCC issued an order on APCo\u2019s 2017-2019 Triennial Review filing concluding that APCo earned above its authorized ROE but within its ROE band for the 2017-2019 period, resulting in no refund to customers and no change to APCo base rates on a prospective basis. The Virginia SCC approved a prospective 9.2% ROE for APCo's 2020-2022 triennial review period with the continuation of a 140 basis point band (8.5% bottom, 9.2% midpoint, 9.9% top).\nIn December 2020, an intervenor filed a petition at the Virginia SCC requesting reconsideration of: (a) the failure of the Virginia SCC to apply a threshold earnings test to the approved regulatory asset for APCo\u2019s closed coal-fired generation assets, (b) the Virginia SCC\u2019s use of a 2011 benchmark study to measure the replacement value of capacity for purposes of APCo\u2019s 2017 - 2019 earnings test and (c) the reasonableness and prudency of APCo\u2019s investments in AMI meters.\nIn December 2020, APCo filed a petition at the Virginia SCC requesting reconsideration of: (a) certain issues related to APCo\u2019s going-forward rates and (b) the Virginia SCC\u2019s decision to deny APCo tariff changes that align rates with underlying costs. For APCo\u2019s going-forward rates, APCo requested that the Virginia SCC clarify its final order and clarify whether APCo\u2019s current rates will allow it to earn a fair return. If the Virginia SCC\u2019s order did conclude on APCo\u2019s ability to earn a fair return through existing base rates, APCo further requested that the Virginia SCC clarify whether it has the authority to also permit an increase in base rates.\nIn March 2021, the Virginia SCC issued an order confirming certain of its decisions from the November 2020 order and rejecting the various requests for reconsideration from APCo and an intervenor. In confirming its decision to reject an intervenor\u2019s recommendation that APCo\u2019s AMI costs incurred during the triennial period be disallowed, the Virginia SCC clarified that APCo established the need to replace its existing AMR meters, and that based on the uncertainty surrounding the continued manufacturing and support of AMR technology, APCo reasonably chose to replace them with AMI meters. In March 2021, APCo filed a notice of appeal of the reconsideration order with the Virginia Supreme Court. In September 2021, APCo submitted its brief before the Virginia Supreme Court. The brief was in alignment with the assignments of error filed by APCo in March 2021. In October 2021, the Virginia SCC and additional intervenors filed briefs with the Virginia Supreme Court disagreeing with APCo\u2019s assignments of error in its appeal of the Triennial Review decision. Additionally, the Virginia SCC and APCo filed briefs disagreeing with an intervenor\u2019s assignments of error in a separate appeal of the same decision. Oral arguments are scheduled to be held at the Virginia Supreme Court in March 2022.\nAPCo ultimately seeks an increase in base rates through its appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court. Among other issues, this appeal includes APCo\u2019s request for proper treatment of the closed coal-fired plant assets in APCo\u2019s 2017-2019 triennial period, reducing APCo\u2019s earnings below the bottom of its authorized ROE band. If APCo\u2019s appeals regarding treatment of the closed coal plants are granted by the Virginia Supreme Court, it could initially reduce future net income and impact financial condition. A Virginia Supreme Court decision in favor of APCo\u2019s original expensing of the closed coal-fired plant asset balances would likely result in a remand to the Virginia SCC. Upon a subsequent Virginia SCC order, the initial negative impact for the write-off of the closed coal-fired plant asset balances could potentially be offset by an increase in base rates for earning below APCo\u2019s 2017-2019 authorized ROE band.\n\u20222012 Texas Base Rate Case - In 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk Plant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant\u2019s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo\u2019s recovery of AFUDC. Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant\u2019s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap. In 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT\u2019s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the Texas Third Court of Appeals. In July 2018, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the PUCT\u2019s judgment affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant and remanded the issue back to the PUCT. In January 2019, SWEPCo and the PUCT filed petitions for review with the Texas Supreme Court.\nIn March 2021, the Texas Supreme Court issued an opinion reversing the July 2018 judgment of the Texas Third Court of Appeals and agreeing with the PUCT\u2019s judgment affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant. In addition, the Texas Supreme Court remanded the AFUDC dispute back to the Texas Third Court of Appeals. In August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court judgement affirming the PUCT\u2019s order on AFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT\u2019s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap, and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. SWEPCo disagrees with the Court of Appeals decision and submitted a Petition for Review with the Texas Supreme Court in November 2021. The Texas Supreme Court requested responses to the Petition for Review, which are due by the end of March 2022.\nIf SWEPCo is ultimately unable to recover capitalized Turk Plant costs including AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap it would be expected to result in a pretax net disallowance ranging from $80 million to $100 million. In addition, if AFUDC is ultimately determined to be included in the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap, SWEPCo estimates it may be required to make customer refunds ranging from $0 to $160 million related to revenues collected from February 2013 through December 2021 and such determination may reduce SWEPCo\u2019s future revenues by approximately $15 million on an annual basis.\n\u2022In July 2019, Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6), which offered incentives for power-generating facilities with zero or reduced carbon emissions, was signed into law by the Ohio Governor. HB 6 phased out current energy efficiency programs as of December 31, 2020, including OPCo\u2019s shared savings revenues of $26 million annually and renewable mandates after 2026. HB 6 also provided for the recovery of existing renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis through 2032 and included a provision for recovery of OVEC costs through 2030 which will be allocated to all electric distribution utilities on a non-bypassable basis. OPCo\u2019s Inter-Company Power Agreement for OVEC terminates in June 2040. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of the Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, Larry Householder, four other individuals, and Generation Now, an entity registered as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. Certain defendants in that case have since pleaded guilty. In August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws in connection with HB 6. In May 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the securities litigation for failure to state a claim, which was granted with prejudice in December 2021. In addition, four AEP shareholders have filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. See Litigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 section of Litigation below for additional information.\nIn March 2021, the Governor of Ohio signed legislation that, among other things, rescinded the payments to the nonaffiliated owner of Ohio\u2019s nuclear power plants that were previously authorized under HB 6. The new legislation, House Bill 128, went into effect in May 2021 and leaves unchanged other provisions of HB 6 regarding energy efficiency programs, recovery of renewable energy costs and recovery of OVEC costs. To the extent that OPCo is unable to recover the costs of renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis by the end of 2032, recover costs of OVEC after 2030 or incurs significant costs associated with the derivative actions, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n\u2022In April 2021, the FERC issued a supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing to modify its incentive for transmission owners that join RTOs (RTO Incentive). Under the supplemental NOPR, the RTO Incentive would be modified such that a utility would only be eligible for the RTO Incentive for the first three years after the utility joins a FERC-approved Transmission Organization. This is a significant departure from a previous NOPR issued in 2020 seeking to increase the RTO Incentive from 50 basis points to 100 basis points. The supplemental NOPR also required utilities that have received the RTO Incentive for three or more years to submit, within 30 days of the effective date of a final rule, a compliance filing to eliminate the incentive from its tariff prospectively. The supplemental NOPR was subject to a 60 day comment period followed by a 30 day period for reply comments. In July 2021, AEP submitted reply comments. AEP is awaiting a final rule from the FERC.\nIn July 2021, the FERC issued an order denying Dayton Power and Light\u2019s request for a 50 basis point RTO incentive on the basis that its RTO participation was not voluntary, but rather is required by Ohio law. This precedent could have an impact on AEP\u2019s transmission owning subsidiaries.\nIn 2019, the FERC approved settlement agreements establishing base ROEs of 9.85% (10.35% inclusive of RTO Incentive adder of 0.5%) and 10% (10.5% inclusive of RTO Incentive adder of 0.5%) for AEP\u2019s PJM and SPP transmission-owning subsidiaries, respectively. In 2020, the FERC determined the base ROE for MISO\u2019s transmission owning subsidiaries should be 10.02% (10.52% inclusive of RTO Incentive adder of 0.5%).\nIf the FERC modifies its RTO Incentive policy, it would be applied, as applicable, to AEP\u2019s PJM, SPP and MISO transmission owning subsidiaries on a prospective basis, and could affect future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Based on management\u2019s preliminary estimates, if a final rule is adopted consistent with the April 2021 supplemental NOPR, it could reduce AEP\u2019s pretax income by approximately $55 million to $70 million on an annual basis.\n\u2022In 2020, Hurricanes Laura and Delta caused power outages and extensive damage to the SWEPCo service territories, primarily impacting the Louisiana jurisdiction. Following both hurricanes, the LPSC issued orders allowing Louisiana utilities, including SWEPCo, to establish regulatory assets to track and defer expenses associated with these storms. In February 2021, severe winter weather impacted the Louisiana jurisdiction and in March 2021 the LPSC approved the deferral of incremental storm restoration expenses related to the winter storm. In October 2021, SWEPCo filed a request with the LPSC for recovery of $145 million in deferred storm costs associated with the three storms. As part of the filing, SWEPCo requested recovery of the carrying charges on the deferred regulatory asset at a weighted average cost of capital through a rider beginning in January 2022. LPSC staff testimony is due to the LPSC in May 2022 and an order is expected before the end of 2022. If any of the storm costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n\u2022In February 2021, severe winter weather had a significant impact in SPP, resulting in the declaration of Energy Emergency Alert Levels 2 and 3 for the first time in SPP\u2019s history. The winter storm increased the demand for natural gas and restricted the available natural gas supply resulting in significantly increased market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. As of December 31, 2021, PSO and SWEPCo have deferred regulatory assets of $679 million and $430 million, respectively, relating to natural gas expenses and purchases of electricity incurred from February 9, 2021, to February 20, 2021, as a result of severe winter weather. SWEPCo\u2019s deferred regulatory asset consists of $103 million, $148 million and $179 million related to the Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas jurisdictions, respectively.\nIn January 2022, PSO, OCC staff and certain intervenors filed a joint stipulation and settlement agreement with the OCC to approve PSO\u2019s securitization of the extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity. The agreement includes a determination that all of PSO\u2019s extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity were prudent and reasonable and a 0.75% carrying charge, subject to true-up based on actual financing costs. In February 2022, the OCC approved the joint stipulation and settlement agreement in its financing order.\nIn March 2021, the APSC issued an order authorizing recovery of the Arkansas jurisdictional share of the retail customer fuel costs over five years, with the appropriate carrying charge to be determined at a later date. Subsequently, SWEPCo began recovery of these fuel costs. SWEPCo is currently recovering the fuel costs at an interim carrying charge of 0.3%. In April 2021, SWEPCo filed testimony supporting a five-year recovery with a carrying charge of 6.05%, which has been supported by APSC staff. Various other parties have recommended recovery periods ranging from 5-20 years with a carrying charge of 1.65%. The APSC ordered more testimony regarding the option of utilizing securitization to recover the fuel costs. SWEPCo is awaiting a decision from the APSC. The prudence of these fuel costs is expected to be addressed in a separate proceeding.\nIn March 2021, the LPSC approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the FAC and shortly after SWEPCo began recovery of its Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs based on a five-year recovery period inclusive of an interim carrying charge of 3.25%. SWEPCo will work with the LPSC to finalize the actual recovery period and determine the appropriate carrying charge in future proceedings.\nIn August 2021, SWEPCo filed an application with the PUCT to implement a net interim fuel surcharge for the Texas jurisdictional share of these retail fuel costs. The application requested a five-year recovery with a carrying charge of 7.18%. In October 2021, various intervenors filed testimony supporting a five-year recovery with a carrying charge ranging from 0.82% to 1.625%. In January 2022, an ALJ issued a PFD recommending a four-year recovery with a carrying charge the same as the annually set interest rate used for under-recovered fuel. In February 2022, SWEPCo filed exceptions to the PFD, disagreeing with the short-term interest rate recommended by the ALJ. SWEPCo is awaiting an order from the PUCT.\nIf SWEPCo is unable to recover any of the costs relating to the extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity, or obtain authorization of a reasonable carrying charge on these costs, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nUtility Rates and Rate Proceedings\nThe Registrants file rate cases with their regulatory commissions in order to establish fair and appropriate electric service rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. The outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the Registrants\u2019 current and future results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe following tables show the Registrants\u2019 completed and pending base rate case proceedings in 2021. See Note 4 - Rate Matters for additional information.\nCompleted Base Rate Case Proceedings\n(a)See \u201c2020 Kentucky Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 - Rate Matters in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information.\n(b)Primarily due to a reduction in the ROE, the removal of proposed future energy efficiency costs and a decrease in vegetation management expenses moved to recovery in riders.\n(c)In February 2022, SWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT challenging several errors in the final order, which includes a challenge of the approved ROE.\n(d)Interim rates were implemented in November 2021.\n(e)Approved increase will be phased-in with a $3 million increase effective February 2022 and the remaining $58 million effective January 2023. Rockport Plant, Unit 2 costs will be recovered through riders until the lease expiration in December 2022.\nPending Base Rate Case Proceedings\n(a)The procedural schedule is on hold due to ongoing settlement discussions.\n(b)Intervenor testimony is scheduled to be filed in March 2022.\nDolet Hills Power Station and Related Fuel Operations\nIn 2020, management of SWEPCo and CLECO determined DHLC would not proceed developing additional Oxbow Lignite Company (Oxbow) mining areas for future lignite extraction and ceased extraction of lignite at the mine in May 2020. In April 2020, SWEPCo and CLECO jointly filed a notification letter to the LPSC providing notice of the cessation of lignite mining. In December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired.\nThe Dolet Hills Power Station non-fuel costs are recoverable by SWEPCo through base rates. As of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo\u2019s share of the net investment in the Dolet Hills Power Station is $108 million, including materials and supplies, net of cost of removal collected in rates.\nFuel costs incurred by the Dolet Hills Power Station are recoverable by SWEPCo through active fuel clauses. As of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of $144 million, excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter weather event, which includes fuel consumed at the Dolet Hills Power Station. Additional reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by DHLC and Oxbow will be billed to SWEPCo and included in existing fuel clauses.\nIn June 2020, SWEPCo filed a fuel reconciliation with the PUCT for its retail operations in Texas, including Dolet Hills, for the reconciliation period of March 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019. See \u201c2020 Texas Fuel Reconciliation\u201d section of Note 5 for additional information.\nIn March 2021, the LPSC issued an order allowing SWEPCo to recover up to $20 million of fuel costs in 2021 and defer approximately $30 million of additional costs with a recovery period to be determined at a later date. In November 2021, the LPSC issued a directive which deferred the issues regarding modification of the level and timing of recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station from SWEPCo\u2019s pending rate case to a separate existing docket. In addition, the recovery of the deferred fuel costs are planned to be addressed.\nIn March 2021, the APSC approved fuel rates that provide recovery of the Arkansas share of the 2021 Dolet Hills Power Station fuel costs over five years through the existing fuel clause. In the Arkansas base case, Staff proposed an extension of the recovery period to 25 years. See \u201c2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\nIf any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nPirkey Power Plant and Related Fuel Operations\nIn 2020, management announced plans to retire the Pirkey Power Plant in 2023. The Pirkey Power Plant non-fuel costs are recoverable by SWEPCo through base rates and fuel costs are recovered through active fuel clauses. As of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo\u2019s share of the net investment in the Pirkey Power Plant is $207 million, including CWIP, before cost of removal. Sabine is a mining operator providing mining services to the Pirkey Power Plant. Under the provisions of the mining agreement, SWEPCo is required to pay, as part of the cost of lignite delivered, an amount equal to mining costs plus a management fee. SWEPCo expects fuel deliveries, including billings of all fixed and operating costs, from Sabine to cease during the first quarter of 2023. Under the fuel agreements, SWEPCo\u2019s fuel inventory and unbilled fuel costs from mining related activities were $91 million as of December 31, 2021. Also, as of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of $144 million, excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter weather event, which includes fuel consumed at the Pirkey Power Plant. Additional operational, reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by Sabine will be billed to SWEPCo and included in existing fuel clauses. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRenewable Generation\nThe growth of AEP\u2019s renewable generation portfolio reflects the company\u2019s strategy to diversify generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs.\nContracted Renewable Generation Facilities\nIn recent years, AEP has developed its renewable portfolio within the Generation & Marketing segment. Activities have included working directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions based upon market knowledge, technology innovations and deal structuring which may include distributed solar, wind, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other forms of cost reducing energy technologies. The Generation & Marketing segment also developed and/or acquired large scale renewable generation projects that are backed with long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties.\nAs of December 31, 2021, subsidiaries within AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment had approximately 1,761 MWs of contracted renewable generation projects in-service. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, these subsidiaries had approximately 27 MWs of renewable generation projects under construction with total estimated capital costs of $27 million related to these projects.\nIn February 2022, AEP management announced the beginning of a process to sell all or a portion of AEP Renewables\u2019 competitive contracted renewables portfolio within the Generation & Marketing segment. As of December 31, 2021, the competitive contracted renewable portfolio assets totaled 1.6 gigawatts of generation resources.\nRegulated Renewable Generation Facilities\nIn 2020, PSO received approval from the OCC and SWEPCo received approval from the APSC and LPSC to acquire the NCWF, comprised of three Oklahoma wind facilities totaling 1,484 MWs, on a fixed cost turn-key basis at completion. Both the APSC and LPSC approved the flex-up option, agreeing to acquire the Texas portion, which the PUCT denied. PSO will own 45.5% and SWEPCo will own 54.5% of the project, which will cost approximately $2 billion.\nIn June 2021, the IRS issued a notice extending the \u201cContinuity Safe Harbor\u201d deadlines for qualifying renewable energy projects. Under the June 2021 IRS notice, the Continuity Safe Harbor for qualifying renewable energy projects that began construction in calendar years 2016 through 2019 is extended to six years. Additionally, the Continuity Safe Harbor is extended to five years for qualifying projects that began construction in calendar year 2020. Provided that each facility does satisfy the Continuity Safe Harbor, under the current IRS guidance, the Sundance wind facility will qualify for 100% of the federal PTC, and the Maverick and Traverse wind facilities will qualify for 80% of the federal PTC.\nIn April 2021, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Sundance during its development and construction for $270 million, the first of the three NCWF acquisitions. Immediately following the acquisition, PSO and SWEPCo liquidated the entity and simultaneously distributed the Sundance assets in proportion to their undivided ownership interests. Sundance was placed in-service in April 2021. In September 2021, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Maverick during its development and construction for $383 million, the second of the three NCWF acquisitions. Immediately following the acquisition, PSO and SWEPCo liquidated the entity and simultaneously distributed the Maverick assets in proportion to their undivided ownership interests. Maverick was placed in-service in September 2021. As of December 31, 2021, PSO and SWEPCo had approximately $316 million and $378 million, of gross Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets, respectively, related to the Sundance and Maverick NCWF projects. The Traverse wind facility is targeted to be acquired and placed in-service in the first quarter of 2022. See \u201cNorth Central Wind Energy Facilities\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nIn June 2021, SWEPCo issued requests for proposals to acquire up to 3,000 MWs of wind and 300 MWs of solar generation resources. The wind and solar generation projects would be subject to regulatory approval.\nIn November 2021, PSO issued requests for proposals to acquire up to 2,800 MWs of wind and 1,350 MWs of solar generation resources. The wind and solar generation projects would be subject to regulatory approval.\nIn December 2021, APCo petitioned for approval to purchase a 204 MW wind project and three solar facilities totaling 205 MWs. Additionally, APCo executed PPAs for another 89 MWs of solar generation resources. In January 2022, APCo issued additional requests for proposals to acquire up to 1,000 MWs of wind and/or 100 MWs of solar generation resources. These wind and solar generation projects would also be subject to regulatory approval.\nDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\nIn October 2021, AEP entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to sell KPCo and KTCo to Liberty Utilities Co., a subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (Liberty), for approximately a $2.85 billion enterprise value. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals from the FERC and KPSC. Clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has been received.\nKPCo currently operates and owns a 50% interest in the 1,560 MW coal-fired Mitchell Power Plant (Mitchell Plant) with the remaining 50% owned by WPCo. The Stock Purchase Agreement is further contingent upon the issuance by the KPSC, WVPSC and FERC of orders regarding a new proposed Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement and Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement between KPCo and WPCo pursuant to which WPCo would replace KPCo as the operator of the Mitchell Plant and KPCo employees at the Mitchell Plant would become employees of WPCo. Under the proposed Ownership Agreement, WPCo is obligated to purchase KPCo\u2019s 50% interest in the Mitchell Plant on December 31, 2028 unless KPCo and WPCo have agreed to retire the Mitchell Plant earlier or, absent such agreement, if WPCo elects prior to December 31, 2027 to retire the Mitchell Plant on December 31, 2028. The Ownership Agreement provides that the purchase price for KPCo\u2019s 50% ownership interest in the Mitchell Plant will be determined through the mutual agreement of WPCo and KPCo (subject to approval from the KPSC and WVPSC) or through a fair market valuation determination conducted by independent appraisals, with offsets for estimated decommissioning costs and the cost of ELG investments made by WPCo, if KPCo and WPCo are unable to reach agreement as to the purchase price.\nIn November 2021, AEP made filings with the KPSC, WVPSC, and FERC seeking approval of the new proposed Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement and Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement. Subsequently, the KPSC and WVPSC intervened in the FERC proceeding and have recommended that FERC dismiss or reject AEP\u2019s request, or defer ruling on AEP\u2019s request until both the retail commissions have rendered decisions. In February 2022, AEP filed a motion to withdraw its filing with the FERC, noting that AEP intends to re-file its request after the KPSC and WVPSC have reviewed the agreements. In the WVPSC proceeding, intervenor testimony is expected in March 2022 and a hearing is scheduled to occur in April 2022.\nIn December 2022, Liberty, KPCo and KTCo sought approval from the FERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act for the sale. In February 2022 several intervenors in the case filed protests related to whether the sale will negatively impact the wholesale transmission and generation rates of applicants. An order from the FERC is expected in the matter in April 2022.\nIn January 2022, intervenor testimony was filed with the KPSC, recommending the KPSC either reject the new proposed Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement or approve the agreement with certain modifications including a revision to the buyout provision that would set WPCo\u2019s Mitchell Plant purchase price at the greater of fair market value or net book value. The intervenor testimony also recommends the KPSC reject the proposed Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement, which the testimony stated should be modified to remove references to the Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement. In February 2022, AEP filed rebuttal testimony with the KPSC opposing the intervenor testimony filed in January 2022. AEP\u2019s rebuttal testimony also discusses an alternative proposal to the fair market value provision included in the proposed Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement. Under the alternative proposal, KPCo\u2019s and WPCo\u2019s interest in the Mitchell Plant would be divided by unit if the plant is not retired before the end of 2028 and a mutual agreement cannot be reached on a buyout price. Under the alternative proposal, mutual agreement on the buyout price or unit disposition would need to be finalized by May 2025, with a\ndivision of plant ownership by unit effective January 1, 2029, unless otherwise agreed. A hearing on the Mitchell Plant agreements is scheduled with the KPSC in March 2022.\nIn January 2022, KPCo and Liberty filed a joint application requesting the KPSC authorize the transfer of ownership of KPCo to Liberty. In February 2022, certain intervenors filed testimony recommending that the KPSC not approve the transfer of ownership. If, however, the KPSC does approve the transfer, these intervenors recommend that the KPSC require AEP to compensate KPCo customers $578 million for alleged future increased costs and higher rates that the intervenors claim will exist under Liberty\u2019s ownership. AEP disagrees with the recommendation and will file rebuttal testimony in March 2022. Intervenors also recommended imposing certain conditions on Liberty, including conditions related to recovering certain costs, inter-company agreement filing requirements, KPCo\u2019s capital structure and future generation resource planning processes and analyses. In addition, certain intervenors argue that the commission should not approve the new proposed Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement and Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement, and that deciding the request to transfer ownership of KPCo should be separated from approval of the Mitchell agreements even though such approval is a condition to the transaction closing. AEP also disagrees with this argument. A hearing is scheduled with the KPSC in March 2022 and a final order is expected in the second quarter of 2022.\nThe sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022 with Liberty acquiring the assets and assuming the liabilities of KPCo and KTCo, excluding pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assets and liabilities. AEP expects to provide customary transition services to Liberty for a period of time after closing of the transaction.\nAEP expects to receive approximately $1.45 billion in cash, net of taxes and transaction fees. AEP plans to use the proceeds to eliminate forecasted equity needs in 2022 as the company invests in regulated renewables, transmission and other projects. AEP and AEPTCo expect the sale to have a one-time impact on after tax earnings that is not material.\nHydroelectric Generation\nRacine\nIn February 2021, AEP signed an agreement to sell Racine to a nonaffiliated party. The sale of Racine closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 resulting in an immaterial gain which is recorded in Other Operation on AEP\u2019s statements of income.\nFederal Tax Reform\nBased on current regulatory orders received, management anticipates amortization of $164 million of Excess ADIT in 2022 ($67 million of Excess ADIT subject to normalization requirements and $97 million of Excess ADIT that is not subject to normalization requirements). Customer usage or new regulatory orders could result in changes to these estimates. Management anticipates amortizing the following ranges of Excess ADIT that is not subject to normalization requirements during the years 2023 through 2027:\nAnnual Amortization of Excess ADIT\nNot Subject to Normalization Requirements\nMerchant Portion of Turk Plant\nSWEPCo constructed the Turk Plant, a base load 600 MW (650 MW net maximum capacity) pulverized coal ultra-supercritical generating unit in Arkansas, which was placed in-service in December 2012 and is included in the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment. SWEPCo owns 73% (440 MWs/477 MWs) of the Turk Plant and operates the facility.\nApproximately 20% of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost-based rate recovery due to not having rate recovery approval in Arkansas. This output is being sold into the wholesale market. Approximately 80% of the Turk Plant investment is recovered under cost-based rate recovery in Texas, Louisiana and through SWEPCo\u2019s wholesale customers under FERC-based rates. As of December 31, 2021, the net book value of the Turk Plant was $1.4 billion, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory. If SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its investment and expenses related to the Turk Plant, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nLITIGATION\nIn the ordinary course of business, AEP is involved in employment, commercial, environmental and regulatory litigation. Since it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, management cannot predict the eventual resolution, timing or amount of any loss, fine or penalty. Management assesses the probability of loss for each contingency and accrues a liability for cases that have a probable likelihood of loss if the loss can be estimated. Adverse results in these proceedings have the potential to reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. See Note 4 - Rate Matters and Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies for additional information.\nRockport Plant Litigation\nIn 2013, the Wilmington Trust Company filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AEGCo and I&M alleging that it would be unlawfully burdened by the terms of the modified NSR consent decree after the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease expiration in December 2022. The terms of the consent decree allow the installation of environmental emission control equipment, repowering, refueling or retirement of the unit. The plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that the defendants breached the lease, must satisfy obligations related to installation of emission control equipment and indemnify the plaintiffs. See \u201cObligations under the New Source Review Litigation Consent Decree\u201d section below for additional information.\nAfter the litigation proceeded at the district court and appellate court, in April 2021, I&M and AEGCo reached an agreement to acquire 100% of the interests in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 for $116 million from certain financial institutions that own the unit through trusts established by Wilmington Trust, the nonaffiliated owner trustee of the ownership interests in the unit, with closing to occur as of the end of the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease in December 2022. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and as of the closing will result in a final settlement of, and release of claims in, the lease litigation. As a result, in May 2021, at the parties\u2019 request, the district court entered a stipulation and order dismissing the case without prejudice to plaintiffs asserting their claims in a re-filed action or a new action. The required regulatory approvals at the IURC and FERC have been obtained that would allow the closing to occur as of the end of the lease in December 2022. The IURC order approved a settlement agreement addressing the future use of Rockport Plant, Unit 2 as a capacity and energy resource and associated adjustments to I&M\u2019s Indiana retail rates, along with certain other matters. Management believes its financial statements appropriately reflect the resolution of the litigation. See Note 13 - Leases for additional information.\nClaims Challenging Transition of American Electric Power System Retirement Plan to Cash Balance Formula\nFour participants in The American Electric Power System Retirement Plan (the Plan) filed a class action complaint in December 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against AEPSC and the Plan. When the Plan\u2019s benefit formula was changed in the year 2000, AEP provided a special provision for employees hired before January 1, 2001, allowing them to continue benefit accruals under the then benefit formula for a full 10 years alongside of the new cash balance benefit formula then being implemented. Employees who were hired on or after January 1, 2001 accrued benefits only under the new cash balance benefit formula. The Plaintiffs assert a number of claims on behalf of themselves and the purported class, including that: (a) the Plan violates the requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) intended to preclude back-loading the accrual of benefits to the end of a participant\u2019s career, (b) the Plan violates the age discrimination prohibitions of ERISA and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and (c) AEP failed to provide required notice regarding the changes to the Plan. Among other relief, the Complaint seeks reformation of the Plan to provide additional benefits and the recovery of plan benefits for former employees under such reformed plan. The Plaintiffs previously had submitted claims for additional plan benefits to AEP, which were denied. On February 15, 2022, AEPSC and the Plan filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. AEP will continue to defend against the claims. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts and OVEC\u2019s coal-fired generating units. OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. After AEP learned of the criminal allegations against the Ohio legislator and others relating to HB 6, AEP, with assistance from outside advisors, conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the passage of the bill. Management does not believe that AEP was involved in any wrongful conduct in connection with the passage of HB 6.\nIn August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws. The amended complaint alleged misrepresentations or omissions by AEP regarding: (a) its alleged participation in or connection to public corruption with respect to the passage of HB 6 and (b) its regulatory, legislative, political contribution, 501(c)(4) organization contribution and lobbying activities in Ohio. The complaint sought monetary damages, among other forms of relief. In December 2021, the District Court issued an opinion and order dismissing the securities litigation complaint with prejudice, determining that the complaint fails to plead any actionable misrepresentations or omissions. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling.\nIn January 2021, an AEP shareholder filed a derivative action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio purporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In February 2021, a second AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. In April 2021, a third AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and a fourth AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Nassau County. These derivative complaints allege the officers and directors made misrepresentations and omissions similar to those alleged in the putative securities class action lawsuit filed against AEP. The derivative complaints together assert claims for: (a) breach of fiduciary duty, (b) waste of corporate assets, (c) unjust enrichment, (d) breach of duty for insider trading and (e) contribution for violations of sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and seek monetary damages and changes to AEP\u2019s corporate governance and internal policies among other forms of relief. The New York state court derivative action is stayed. The Ohio state court derivative action was stayed until February 18, 2022, and the parties to that case filed a stipulation seeking to extend the stay. The two derivative actions pending in federal court have been consolidated, and the parties to the consolidated action have filed a joint motion for the court to enter a scheduling order pursuant to which plaintiffs will file an amended complaint and the parties will then propose a briefing schedule for defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The defendants will continue to defend against the claims. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn March 2021, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing a purported AEP shareholder. The litigation demand letter is directed to the Board of Directors of AEP and contains factual allegations involving HB 6 that are generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The letter demands, among other things, that the AEP Board undertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations by directors and officers, and that, following such investigation, AEP commence a civil action for breaches of fiduciary duty and related claims and take appropriate disciplinary action against those individuals who allegedly harmed the company. The shareholder that sent the letter has agreed that AEP and the AEP Board may defer consideration of the litigation demand until the resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities litigation. The AEP Board will act in response to the letter as appropriate. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn May 2021, AEP received a subpoena from the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement seeking various documents, including documents relating to the benefits to AEP from the passage of HB 6 and documents relating to AEP\u2019s financial processes and controls. AEP is cooperating fully with the SEC\u2019s subpoena. Although the outcome of the SEC\u2019s investigation cannot be predicted, management does not believe the results of this inquiry will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\nAEP has a substantial capital investment program and incurs additional operational costs to comply with environmental control requirements. Additional investments and operational changes will be made in response to existing and anticipated requirements to reduce emissions from fossil generation and in response to rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of coal combustion by-products, clean water and renewal permits for certain water discharges.\nAEP is engaged in litigation about environmental issues, was notified of potential responsibility for the clean-up of contaminated sites and incurred costs for disposal of SNF and future decommissioning of the nuclear units. Management is engaged in the development of possible future requirements including the items discussed below. Management believes that further analysis and better coordination of these environmental requirements would facilitate planning and lower overall compliance costs while achieving the same environmental goals.\nAEP will seek recovery of expenditures for pollution control technologies and associated costs from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions. Environmental rules could result in accelerated depreciation, impairment of assets or regulatory disallowances. If AEP cannot recover the costs of environmental compliance, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nEnvironmental Controls Impact on the Generating Fleet\nThe rules and proposed environmental controls discussed below will have a material impact on AEP System generating units. Management continues to evaluate the impact of these rules, project scope and technology available to achieve compliance. As of December 31, 2021, the AEP System owned generating capacity of approximately 25,000 MWs, of which approximately 11,900 MWs were coal-fired. Management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with these rules and other impacts of the environmental proposals on fossil generation. Based upon management estimates, AEP\u2019s future investment to meet these existing and proposed requirements ranges from approximately $325 million to $550 million through 2028.\nThe cost estimates will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in finalizing proposed rules or revising certain existing requirements. The cost estimates will also change based on: (a) potential state rules that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired and replaced, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity, (g) compliance with the Federal EPA\u2019s revised coal combustion residual rules and (h) other factors. In addition, management continues to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on regulated and competitive plants.\nObligations under the New Source Review Litigation Consent Decree\nIn 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio approved a consent decree between AEP subsidiaries in the eastern area of the AEP System and the Department of Justice, the Federal EPA, eight northeastern states and other interested parties to settle claims that the AEP subsidiaries violated the NSR provisions of the CAA when they undertook various equipment repair and replacement projects over a period of nearly 20 years. The consent decree\u2019s terms include installation of environmental control equipment on certain generating units, a declining cap on SO2 and NOX emissions from the AEP System and various mitigation projects. The consent decree has been modified six times, for various reasons, most recently in 2020. All of the environmental control equipment required by the consent decree has been installed.\nClean Air Act Requirements\nThe CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation\u2019s air quality and control sources of air emissions. The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements. The primary regulatory programs that continue to drive investments in AEP\u2019s existing generating units include: (a) periodic revisions to NAAQS and the development of SIPs to achieve any more stringent standards, (b) implementation of the regional haze program by the states and the Federal EPA, (c) regulation of hazardous air pollutant emissions under MATS, (d) implementation and review of CSAPR and (e) the Federal EPA\u2019s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil generation under Section 111 of the CAA. Notable developments in significant CAA regulatory requirements affecting AEP\u2019s operations are discussed in the following sections.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe Federal EPA periodically reviews and revises the NAAQS for criteria pollutants under the CAA. Revisions tend to increase the stringency of the standards, which in turn may require AEP to make investments in pollution control equipment at existing generating units, or, since most units are already well controlled, to make changes in how units are dispatched and operated. Most recently, the Biden administration has indicated that it is likely to revisit the NAAQS for ozone and PM, which were left unchanged by the prior administration following its review. Management cannot currently predict if any changes to either standard are likely or what such changes may be, but will continue to monitor this issue and any future rulemakings.\nRegional Haze\nThe Federal EPA issued a Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in 2005, which could require power plants and other facilities to install best available retrofit technology to address regional haze in federal parks and other protected areas. CAVR is implemented by the states, through SIPs, or by the Federal EPA, through FIPs. In 2017, the Federal EPA revised the rules governing submission of SIPs to implement the visibility programs, including a provision that postponed the due date for the next comprehensive SIP revisions until 2021. Petitions for review of the final rule revisions have been filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\nArkansas has an approved regional haze SIP and all of SWEPCo's affected units are in compliance with the relevant requirements.\nIn Texas, the Federal EPA disapproved portions of the Texas regional haze SIP and finalized a FIP that allows participation in the CSAPR ozone season program to satisfy the NOX regional haze obligations for electric generating units in Texas. Additionally, the Federal EPA finalized an intrastate SO2 emissions trading program based on CSAPR allowance allocations. Legal challenges to these various rulemakings are pending in both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation, although management supports the intrastate trading program as a compliance alternative to source-specific controls and has intervened in the litigation in support of the Federal EPA.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nCSAPR is a regional trading program designed to address interstate transport of emissions that contributed significantly to downwind non-attainment with the 1997 ozone and PM NAAQS. CSAPR relies on SO2 and NOX allowances and individual state budgets to compel further emission reductions from electric utility generating units. Interstate trading of allowances is allowed on a restricted sub-regional basis.\nIn January 2021, the Federal EPA finalized a revised CSAPR rule, which substantially reduces the ozone season NOX budgets in 2021-2024. Several utilities and other entities potentially subject to the Federal EPA\u2019s NOX regulations have challenged that final rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and briefing is underway. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation, but believes it can meet the requirements of the rule in the near term, and is evaluating its compliance options for later years, when the budgets are further reduced.\nClimate Change, CO2 Regulation and Energy Policy\nIn 2019, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule established a framework for states to adopt standards of performance for utility boilers based on heat rate improvements for such boilers. However, in January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule and remanded it to the Federal EPA. Management is unable to predict how the Federal EPA will respond to the court\u2019s remand. In October 2021 the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and combined four separate petitions seeking review of the D.C. Circuit Court decisions. Briefing is underway but management is unable to predict the outcome of that litigation.\nIn 2018, the Federal EPA filed a proposed rule revising the standards for new sources and determined that partial carbon capture and storage is not the best system of emission reduction because it is not available throughout the U.S. and is not cost-effective. That rule has not been finalized. Management continues to actively monitor these rulemaking activities.\nWhile no federal regulatory requirements to reduce CO2 emissions are in place, AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO2 emissions from its generating fleet. AEP expects CO2 emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities. The majority of the states where AEP has generating facilities passed legislation establishing renewable energy, alternative energy and/or energy efficiency requirements that can assist in reducing carbon emissions. In April 2020, Virginia enacted clean energy legislation to allow the state to participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, require the retirement of all fossil-fueled generation by 2045 and require 100% renewable energy to be provided to Virginia customers by 2050. Management is taking steps to comply with these requirements, including increasing wind and solar installations, purchasing renewable power and broadening AEP System\u2019s portfolio of energy efficiency programs.\nIn February 2021, AEP announced new intermediate and long-term CO2 emission reduction goals, based on the output of the company\u2019s integrated resource plans, which take into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resiliency, regulations and the company\u2019s current business strategy. The intermediate goal is an 80% reduction from 2000 CO2 emission levels from AEP generating facilities by 2030; the long-term goal is net-zero CO2 emissions from AEP generating facilities by 2050. AEP\u2019s total estimated CO2 emissions in 2021 were approximately 50 million metric tons, a 70% reduction from AEP\u2019s 2000 CO2 emissions. AEP has made significant progress in reducing CO2 emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline. Technological advances, including energy storage, will determine how quickly AEP can achieve zero emissions while continuing to provide reliable, affordable power for customers.\nExcessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations have led to the announcement of early plant closures and could force AEP to close additional coal-fired generation facilities earlier than their estimated useful life. If AEP is unable to recover the costs of its investments, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nCoal Combustion Residual (CCR) Rule\nThe Federal EPA\u2019s CCR rule regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of CCR, including fly ash and bottom ash created from coal-fired generating units and FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants. The rule applies to active and inactive CCR landfills and surface impoundments at facilities of active electric utility or independent power producers.\nIn August 2020, the Federal EPA revised the CCR rule to include a requirement that unlined CCR storage ponds cease operations and initiate closure by April 11, 2021. The revised rule provides two options that allow facilities to extend the date by which they must cease receipt of coal ash and close the ponds.\nThe first option provides an extension to cease receipt of CCR no later than October 15, 2023 for most units, and October 15, 2024 for a narrow subset of units; however, the Federal EPA\u2019s grant of such an extension will be based upon a satisfactory demonstration of the need for additional time to develop alternative ash disposal capacity and will be limited to the soonest timeframe technically feasible to cease receipt of CCR. Additionally, each request must undergo formal review, including public comments, and be approved by the Federal EPA. AEP filed applications for additional time to develop alternative disposal capacity at the following plants:\n(a)Net book value before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory.\n(b)Amount includes a $171 million regulatory asset related to the retired Tanners Creek Plant. The IURC and MPSC authorized recovery of the Tanners Creek Plant regulatory asset over the useful life of Rockport Plant, Unit 1 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn addition, AGR owns Cardinal Plant, Unit 1 a competitive generation unit. A nonaffiliated electric cooperative owns Cardinal Plant, Unit 2 and Unit 3 and operates all three units at the Cardinal Plant. The nonaffiliate filed an application for additional time to develop alternative disposal capacity for the Cardinal Plant. As of December 31, 2021, the net book value of Cardinal Plant, Unit 1, including materials and supplies and CWIP, before cost of removal, was approximately $46 million.\nIn January 2022, the Federal EPA began responding to applications for extension requests and has proposed to deny several extension requests based on allegations that the utilities that received such responses are not in compliance with the CCR Rule. The Federal EPA\u2019s allegations of noncompliance rely on new interpretations of the CCR Rule requirements, are subject to a 30 day public comment period prior to final determination and could ultimately be challenged in court. While the Federal EPA has not yet proposed any action on pending extension requests submitted by AEP, statements made by the Federal EPA in proposed denials of extension requests submitted by other utilities indicate that there is a risk that the Federal EPA may similarly conclude that AEP is not eligible for an extension of time to cease use of its CCR impoundments and/or that one or more of AEP\u2019s facilities is not in compliance with the CCR Rule. If that occurs, AEP may incur material additional costs to change its plans for complying with the CCR Rule, including the potential to have to temporarily cease operation of one or more facilities until an acceptable compliance alternative can be implemented. Such temporary cessation of operation could materially impact the cost of serving customers of the affected utility. Further, actions by the Federal EPA could require AEP to remove coal ash from CCR impoundments in Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia that have already been closed in accordance with state law programs or would require AEP to incur costs related to CCR impoundments at various facilities.\nClosure and post-closure costs have been included in ARO in accordance with the requirements in the Federal EPA\u2019s final CCR rule. Additional ARO revisions will occur on a site-by-site basis if groundwater monitoring activities conclude that corrective actions are required to mitigate groundwater impacts. AEP may incur significant additional costs complying with the Federal EPA\u2019s CCR Rule including costs to upgrade or close and replace surface impoundments and landfills used to manage CCR and to conduct any required remedial actions including removal of coal ash. If additional costs are incurred related to competitive units or in regulated jurisdictions without providing similar assurances of cost recovery, it would impose significant additional operating costs on AEP, which could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Management will continue to participate in rulemaking activities and make adjustments based on new federal and state requirements affecting its ash disposal units.\nThe second option is a retirement option, which provides a generating facility an extended operating time without developing alternative CCR disposal. Under the retirement option, a generating facility would have until October 17, 2023 to cease operation and to close CCR storage ponds 40 acres or less in size, or through October 17, 2028 for facilities with CCR storage ponds greater than 40 acres in size. Pursuant to this option, AEP informed the Federal EPA of its intent to retire the Pirkey Power Plant and cease using coal at the Welsh Plant:\nCompany Plant Name and Unit Generating\nCapacity Net Investment (a) Accelerated Depreciation Regulatory Asset Projected\nRetirement Date\n(in MWs) (in millions)\nSWEPCo Pirkey Power Plant 580 $ 120.0 $ 87.0 2023 (b)\nSWEPCo Welsh Plants, Units 1 & 3 1,053 475.2 45.9 2028 (c)(d)\n(a)Net book value including CWIP excluding cost of removal and materials and supplies.\n(b)Pirkey Power Plant is currently being recovered through 2025 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2045 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\n(c)In November 2020, management announced it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028.\n(d)Unit 1 is currently being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\nUnder the retirement option above, AEP may need to recover remaining depreciation and estimated closure costs associated with retiring plants over a shorter period. If AEP cannot ultimately recover the costs of environmental compliance and/or the remaining depreciation and estimated closure costs associated with retiring plants in a timely manner, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nClean Water Act Regulations\nThe Federal EPA\u2019s ELG rule for generating facilities establishes limits for FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater, which are to be implemented through each facility\u2019s wastewater discharge permit. A revision to the ELG rule, published in October 2020, establishes additional options for reusing and discharging small volumes of bottom ash transport water, provides an exception for retiring units and extends the compliance deadline to a date as soon as possible beginning one year after the rule was published but no later than December 2025. Management has assessed technology additions and retrofits to comply with the rule and the impacts of the Federal EPA\u2019s recent actions on facilities\u2019 wastewater discharge permitting for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water. For affected facilities that must install additional technologies to meet the ELG rule limits, permit modifications were filed in January 2021 that reflect the outcome of that assessment. We continue to work with state agencies to finalize permit terms and conditions. Other facilities opted to file Notices of Planned Participation (NOPP), pursuant to which the facilities are not required to install additional controls to meet ELG limits provided they make commitments to cease coal combustion by a date certain. The Federal EPA has announced its intention to reconsider the 2020 rule and to further revise limits applicable to discharges of landfill and impoundment leachate. A proposed rule is expected in late 2022. Management cannot predict whether the Federal EPA will actually finalize further revisions or what such revisions might be, but we will continue to monitor this issue and will participate in further rulemaking activities as they arise.\nIn August 2021, the Federal EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers announced their plan to reconsider and revise the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which defines \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the Clean Water Act. Shortly thereafter, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona vacated and remanded the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which had the effect of reinstating the prior, much broader, version of the rule. Because the scope of waters subject to the Federal EPA and Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictions is broader under the prior rule, permitting decisions made in recent years are subject to reevaluation; permits may now be necessary where none were previously required, and issued permits may need to be reopened to impose additional obligations. In December 2021, the Federal EPA proposed a rule that would roll back the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d to the pre-2015 definition. The Federal EPA also announced that it would be considering further changes through a future rulemaking, which would build upon the foundation of the proposed rule. Management will continue to monitor rulemaking on this issue.\nCCR and ELG Compliance Plan Filings\nMitchell Plant (Applies to AEP)\nKPCo and WPCo each own a 50% interest in the Mitchell Plant. In December 2020 and February 2021, WPCo and KPCo filed requests with the WVPSC and KPSC, respectively, to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to implement CCR and ELG compliance plans and seek recovery of the estimated $132 million investment for the Mitchell Plant that would allow the plant to continue operating beyond 2028. Within those requests, WPCo and KPCo also filed a $25 million alternative to implement only the CCR-related investments with the WVPSC and KPSC, respectively, which would allow the Mitchell Plant to continue operating only through 2028.\nIn July 2021, the KPSC issued an order approving the CCR only alternative and rejecting the full CCR and ELG compliance plan. In August 2021, the WVPSC approved the full CCR and ELG compliance plan for the WPCo share of the Mitchell Plant. In September 2021, WPCo submitted a filing with the WVPSC to reopen the CCR/ELG case that was approved by the WVPSC in August 2021. Due to the rejection by the KPSC of the KPCo share of the ELG investments, WPCo requested the WVPSC consider approving the construction and recovery of all ELG costs at the plant. In October 2021, the WVPSC affirmed its August 2021 order approving the construction of CCR/ELG investments and directed WPCo to proceed with CCR/ELG compliance plans that would allow the plant to continue operating beyond 2028. The WVPSC\u2019s order further states WPCo will not share capacity and energy from the plant with KPCo customers if those customers are not paying for ELG compliance costs, or for any new capital investment or continuing operations costs incurred, to allow the plant to operate beyond 2028 or prevent downgrades prior to 2028. The WVPSC also ordered that WPCo will be given the opportunity to recover, from its customers, the new capital and operating costs arising solely from the WVPSC's directive to operate the plant beyond 2028 if the WVPSC finds that the costs are reasonably and prudently incurred. In October and November 2021, intervenors filed petitions for reconsideration at the WVPSC requesting clarification on certain aspects of the\norder, primarily the jurisdictional allocation of future operating expenses and plant costs.\nIn November 2021, AEP made filings with the KPSC, WVPSC and FERC seeking approval for a new proposed Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement and Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement between KPCo and WPCo pursuant to which WPCo would replace KPCo as the operator of the Mitchell Plant. In February 2022, AEP filed a motion to withdraw its filing with the FERC, noting that AEP intends to re-file its request after the KPSC and WVPSC reviews have been completed. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Mitchell Plant ELG investment balance in CWIP was $6 million split equally between KPCo and WPCo. As of December 31, 2021, the net book value of KPCo\u2019s share of the Mitchell Plant, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory, was $586 million.\nIf any of the ELG costs are not approved for recovery and/or the retirement date of the Mitchell Plant is accelerated to 2028 without commensurate cost recovery, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nAmos and Mountaineer Plants (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nIn December 2020, APCo submitted filings with the Virginia SCC and WVPSC requesting regulatory approvals necessary to implement CCR and ELG compliance plans and seek recovery of the estimated $240 million investment for the Amos and Mountaineer plants. Intervenors in Virginia and West Virginia recommended that only the CCR-related investments be constructed at Amos and Mountaineer and, as a consequence, that APCo close these generating facilities at the end of 2028.\nIn August 2021, the Virginia SCC issued an order approving APCo\u2019s request to construct CCR-related investments at the Amos and Mountaineer Plants and approved recovery of CCR-related other operation and maintenance expenses and investments through an active rider. The order denied APCo\u2019s request to construct the ELG investments and denied recovery of previously incurred ELG costs. APCo plans to refile for approval of the ELG investments and previously incurred ELG costs in the first quarter of 2022.\nAlso in August 2021, the WVPSC approved the request to construct CCR/ELG investments at the Amos and Mountaineer Plants and approved recovery of the West Virginia jurisdictional share of these costs through an active rider. In October 2021, due to the Virginia SCC previously rejecting the ELG investments, the WVPSC issued an order directing APCo to proceed with CCR/ELG compliance plans that would allow the plants to continue operating beyond 2028. The October order further states that APCo will not share capacity and energy from the plants with customers from Virginia if those customers are not paying for ELG compliance costs, or for any new capital investment or continuing operations costs incurred, to allow the plants to operate beyond 2028 or prevent downgrades prior to 2028. The WVPSC also ordered that APCo will be given the opportunity to recover, from West Virginia customers, the new capital and operating costs arising solely from the WVPSC's directive to operate the plants beyond 2028 if the WVPSC finds that the costs are reasonably and prudently incurred. In October and November 2021, intervenors filed petitions for reconsideration at the WVPSC requesting clarification on certain aspects of the order, primarily the jurisdictional allocation of future operating expenses and plant costs.\nAPCo expects total Amos and Mountaineer Plant ELG investment, excluding AFUDC, to be approximately $197 million. As of December 31, 2021, APCo\u2019s Virginia jurisdictional share of the net book value, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory, of the Amos and Mountaineer Plants was approximately $1.5 billion and APCo\u2019s Virginia jurisdictional share of its ELG investment balance in CWIP for these plants was $26 million.\nIf any of the ELG costs are not approved for recovery and/or the retirement dates of the Amos and Mountaineer plants are accelerated to 2028 without commensurate cost recovery, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nImpact of Environmental Regulation on Coal-Fired Generation\nCompliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits. Management continuously evaluates cost estimates of complying with these regulations which may result in a decision to retire coal-fired generating facilities earlier than their currently estimated useful lives.\nPreviously, management retired or announced early closure plans for Welsh Unit 2, Oklaunion Power Station, Dolet Hills Power Station and Northeastern Plant Unit 3.\nThe table below summarizes the net book value, as of December 31, 2021, of generating facilities retired or planned for early retirement in advance of the retirement date currently authorized for ratemaking purposes:\n(a)Net book value including CWIP excluding cost of removal and materials and supplies.\n(b)These amounts represent the amount of annual depreciation that has been collected from customers over the prior 12-month period.\n(c)Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2040.\n(d)Dolet Hills Power Station is currently being recovered through 2026 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2046 in the Arkansas jurisdiction. In December 2021, the PUCT authorized the recovery of SWEPCo\u2019s Texas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2046 without providing a return on the investment which resulted in a disallowance of $12 million. See Note 4 - Rate Matters for additional information.\n(e)Pirkey Power Plant is currently being recovered through 2025 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2045 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\n(f)In November 2020, management announced it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028.\n(g)Welsh Plant, Unit 1 is being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Welsh Plant, Unit 3 is being recovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\n(h)Welsh Plant, Unit 2 is being recovered over the blended useful life of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3.\nManagement is seeking or will seek regulatory recovery, as necessary, for any net book value remaining when the plants are retired. To the extent the net book value of these generation assets are not deemed recoverable, it could materially reduce future net income, cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSEGMENTS\nAEP\u2019s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements.\nAEP\u2019s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below:\nVertically Integrated Utilities\n\u2022Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.\nTransmission and Distribution Utilities\n\u2022Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo.\n\u2022OPCo purchases energy and capacity at auction to serve standard service offer customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load.\nAEP Transmission Holdco\n\u2022Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEPTCo. These investments have FERC-approved ROE.\n\u2022Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP\u2019s transmission-only joint ventures. These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved ROE.\nGeneration & Marketing\n\u2022Contracted renewable energy investments and management services.\n\u2022Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, MISO, PJM and SPP.\n\u2022Competitive generation in PJM.\nThe remainder of AEP\u2019s activities are presented as Corporate and Other. While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent\u2019s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs.\nThe following discussion of AEP\u2019s results of operations by operating segment includes an analysis of Gross Margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Gross Margin includes Total Revenues less the costs of Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation, as well as Purchased Electricity for Resale, as presented in the Registrants\u2019 statements of income as applicable. Under the various state utility rate making processes, these expenses are generally reimbursable directly from and billed to customers. As a result, they do not typically impact Operating Income or Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders. Management believes that Gross Margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze AEP\u2019s financial performance in that it excludes the effect on Total Revenues caused by volatility in these expenses. Operating Income, which is presented in accordance with GAAP in AEP\u2019s statements of income, is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to the presentation of Gross Margin. AEP\u2019s definition of Gross Margin may not be directly comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other companies.\nA detailed discussion of AEP\u2019s 2020 results of operations by operating segment can be found in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation section included in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021.\nThe following table presents Earnings (Loss) Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders by segment:\nNote: 2021 Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders by Segment excludes Corporate and Other which is not considered a reportable segment.\nAEP CONSOLIDATED\n2021 Compared to 2020\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders increased from $2.2 billion in 2020 to $2.5 billion in 2021 primarily due to:\n\u2022Favorable rate proceedings in AEP\u2019s various jurisdictions.\n\u2022An increase in transmission investment, which resulted in higher revenues and income.\n\u2022An increase in weather-related usage.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\u2022An increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses not subject to regulatory rider mechanisms.\nAEP\u2019s results of operations by reportable segment are discussed below.\nVERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES\n(a)Other AEP Segments excludes Corporate and Other which is not considered a reportable segment.\n(a)Includes Off-system Sales, municipalities and cooperatives, unit power and other wholesale customers.\nHeating degree days and cooling degree days are metrics commonly used in the utility industry as a measure of the impact of weather on revenues. In general, degree day changes in the eastern region have a larger effect on revenues than changes in the western region due to the relative size of the two regions and the number of customers within each region.\n(a)Heating degree days are calculated on a 55 degree temperature base.\n(b)Normal Heating/Cooling represents the thirty-year average of degree days.\n(c)Cooling degree days are calculated on a 65 degree temperature base.\n2021 Compared to 2020\nReconciliation of Year Ended December 31, 2020 to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders from Vertically Integrated Utilities\n(in millions)\nThe major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows:\n\u2022Retail Margins increased $470 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $104 million increase due to rider revenues of $99 million for APCo and $5 million for WPCo, respectively, which includes the WV modified rate base cost surcharge, effective September 2021.

In 2021, a $10 million gain was recorded, $5 million of which was unrealized.\n\u2022An $8 million increase in the EIS reserve.\n\u2022A $7 million increase in general corporate expenses.\n\u2022A $6 million increase in estimated health care benefits for certain retirees.\nAEP SYSTEM INCOME TAXES\n2021 Compared to 2020\n\u2022Income Tax Expense increased $75 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $77 million increase due to an increase in pretax book income.\n\u2022A $48 million increase due to the recognition of a discrete tax adjustment in 2020 attributable to the CARES Act.\n\u2022A $25 million increase in state deferred taxes due to legislative changes for Oklahoma and West Virginia.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $55 million decrease to tax expense due to an out of period adjustment related to deferred taxes.\n\u2022A $19 million increase in tax credits primarily related to PTC.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAEP measures financial condition by the strength of its balance sheet and the liquidity provided by its cash flows.\nSIGNIFICANT CASH REQUIREMENTS\nAEP\u2019s contractual cash obligations include amounts reported on the balance sheets and other obligations disclosed in the footnotes. It is anticipated that these obligations will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, long-term debt issuances, short-term debt through AEP\u2019s Commercial Paper Program or bank term loans, proceeds from the Kentucky operations sale and the use of the ATM Program or other equity issuances.\nCapital Expenditures\nContinued capital investments reflect AEP\u2019s commitment to enhance service and deliver reliable, clean energy and advanced technologies that exceed customer expectations. See \u201cBudgeted Capital Expenditures\u201d herein, for additional information.\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt maturities, including interest, represent a significant cash requirement for AEP and the Registrant Subsidiaries. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information relating to the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021, the weighted-average interest rate applicable to each debt category and a schedule of debt maturities over the next five years.\nOther Significant Cash Requirements\nOperating and finance leases represent a significant component of funding requirements for AEP and the Registrant Subsidiaries. See Note 13 - Leases for additional information.\nThe AEP System has substantial commitments for fuel, energy and capacity contracts as part of the normal course of business. See Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2021, AEP expected to make contributions to the pension plans totaling $134 million in 2022. Estimated contributions of $129 million in 2023 and $7 million in 2024 may vary significantly based on market returns, changes in actuarial assumptions and other factors. Based upon the projected benefit obligation and fair value of assets available to pay pension benefits, the pension plans were 103.2% funded as of December 31, 2021. See \u201cEstimated Future Benefit Payments and Contributions\u201d section of Note 8 for additional information.\nStandby letters of credit are entered into with third-parties. These letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs, security deposits and debt security reserves. There is no collateral held in relation to any guarantees in excess of the ownership percentages. In the event any letters of credit are drawn, there is no recourse to third-parties. See \u201cLetters of Credit\u201d section of Note 6 for additional information.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDebt and Equity Capitalization\nAEP\u2019s ratio of debt-to-total capital decreased from 61.8% to 61.4% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, primarily due to an increase in earnings in 2021 as compared to 2020, partially offset by an increase in debt to support distribution, transmission and renewable investment growth.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining AEP\u2019s financial stability. Management believes AEP has adequate liquidity under its existing credit facilities. As of December 31, 2021, AEP had $5 billion in revolving credit facilities to support its commercial paper program. Additional liquidity is available from cash from operations and a receivables securitization agreement. Management is committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. AEP generally uses short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs, property acquisitions and construction until long-term funding is arranged. Sources of long-term funding include issuance of long-term debt, leasing agreements, hybrid securities or common stock. In February 2021, severe winter weather impacted certain AEP service territories resulting in disruptions to SPP market conditions. In March 2021, AEP entered into a $500 million 364-day Term Loan and borrowed the full amount to help address the cash flow implications resulting from the February 2021 severe winter weather event. See Note 4 - Rate Matters for additional information.\nNet Available Liquidity\nAEP manages liquidity by maintaining adequate external financing commitments. As of December 31, 2021, available liquidity was approximately $4 billion as illustrated in the table below:\n(a)AEP intends to extend the maturity of this loan to the third quarter of 2022.\nAEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries. The program funds a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP\u2019s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries; and the short-term debt requirements of subsidiaries that are not participating in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons, as direct borrowers. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2021 was $2.5 billion. The weighted-average interest rate for AEP\u2019s commercial paper during 2021 was 0.24%.\nOther Credit Facilities\nAn uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. AEP issues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under five uncommitted facilities totaling, as of December 31, 2021, $375 million. Subsequently, in February 2022, the uncommitted facilities total was increased to $400 million. The Registrants\u2019 maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities as of December 31, 2021, was $169 million with maturities ranging from January 2022 to December 2022.\nFinancing Plan\nAs of December 31, 2021, AEP had $2.2 billion of long-term debt due within one year, excluding $200 million classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet. This also included $440 million of Pollution Control Bonds with mandatory tender dates and credit support for variable interest rates that requires the debt be classified as current and $117 million of securitization bonds and DCC Fuel notes. Management plans to refinance the majority of the maturities due within one year on a long-term basis.\nSecuritized Accounts Receivables\nAEP Credit\u2019s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of $750 million from bank conduits to purchase receivables and was amended in September 2021 to include a $125 million and a $625 million facility, which expire in September 2023 and 2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the affiliated utility subsidiaries are in compliance with all requirements under the agreement.\nDebt Covenants and Borrowing Limitations\nAEP\u2019s credit agreements contain certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in AEP\u2019s credit agreements. Debt as defined in the revolving credit agreement excludes securitization bonds and debt of AEP Credit. As of December 31, 2021, this contractually-defined percentage was 58.2%. Non-performance under these covenants could result in an event of default under these credit agreements. In addition, the acceleration of AEP\u2019s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of AEP\u2019s major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements. This condition also applies in a majority of AEP\u2019s non-exchange-traded commodity contracts and would similarly allow lenders and counterparties to declare the outstanding amounts payable. However, a default under AEP\u2019s non-exchange-traded commodity contracts would not cause an event of default under its credit agreements.\nThe revolving credit facility does not permit the lenders to refuse a draw on any facility if a material adverse change occurs.\nUtility Money Pool borrowings and external borrowings may not exceed amounts authorized by regulatory orders and AEP manages its borrowings to stay within those authorized limits.\nATM Program\nAEP participates in an ATM offering program that allows AEP to issue, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1 billion of its common stock, including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to an equity forward sales agreement. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $511 million of equity is available for issuance under the ATM offering program. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\nEquity Units\nIn August 2020, AEP issued 17 million Equity Units initially in the form of corporate units, at a stated amount of $50 per unit, for a total stated amount of $850 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $833 million. Each corporate unit represents a 1/20 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal\namount of AEP\u2019s 1.30% Junior Subordinated Notes due in 2025 and a forward equity purchase contract which settles after three years in 2023. The proceeds were used to support AEP\u2019s overall capital expenditure plan.\nIn March 2019, AEP issued 16.1 million Equity Units initially in the form of corporate units, at a stated amount of $50 per unit, for a total stated amount of $805 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $785 million. Each corporate unit represents a 1/20 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of AEP\u2019s 3.40% Junior Subordinated Notes due in 2024 and a forward equity purchase contract which settles after three years in 2022. The proceeds from this issuance were used to support AEP\u2019s overall capital expenditure plans including the recent acquisition of Sempra Renewables LLC. In January 2022, AEP successfully remarketed the notes on behalf of holders of the corporate units and did not directly receive any proceeds therefrom. Instead, the holders of the corporate units may use the debt remarketing proceeds towards settling the forward equity purchase contract with AEP in March 2022. The interest rate on the notes was reset to 2.031% with the maturity remaining in 2024.\nSee Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\nDividend Policy and Restrictions\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per-share in January 2022. Future dividends may vary depending upon AEP\u2019s profit levels, operating cash flow levels and capital requirements, as well as financial and other business conditions existing at the time. Parent\u2019s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends. Management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on its ability to access cash to meet the payment of dividends on its common stock. See \u201cDividend Restrictions\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information.\nCredit Ratings\nAEP and its utility subsidiaries do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit downgrade, but its access to the commercial paper market may depend on its credit ratings. In addition, downgrades in AEP\u2019s credit ratings by one of the rating agencies could increase its borrowing costs. Counterparty concerns about the credit quality of AEP or its utility subsidiaries could subject AEP to additional collateral demands under adequate assurance clauses under its derivative and non-derivative energy contracts.\nCASH FLOW\nAEP relies primarily on cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and investing activities. AEP\u2019s investing and capital requirements are primarily capital expenditures, repaying of long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. AEP uses short-term debt, including commercial paper, as a bridge to long-term debt financing. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows.\nOperating Activities\n(a)Non-Cash Adjustments to Net Income includes Depreciation and Amortization, Rockport Plant, Unit 2 Lease Amortization, Deferred Income Taxes, Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges, Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction, Amortization of Nuclear Fuel and Pension and Postemployment Benefit Reserves.\n2021 Compared to 2020\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities increased by $7 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $745 million increase in cash from Changes in Certain Components of Working Capital. The increase is primarily due to a decrease in fuel, material and supplies balances driven by a decrease in coal and lignite inventory on hand, the timing of accounts payable and an income tax refund received in 2021 for taxes paid in 2014 under the NOL carryback provision for the CARES Act, partially offset by margin deposits paid to PJM.\n\u2022A $377 million increase in cash from Net Income, after non-cash adjustments. See Results of Operations for further detail.\n\u2022A $261 million increase in cash from Changes in Other Noncurrent Liabilities. The increase is primarily due to changes in regulatory liabilities driven by timing differences between collections from and refunds to customers under rate rider mechanisms. See Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for additional information.\n\u2022A $110 million increase in cash due to a discretionary contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2020. See Note 8 - Benefit Plans for additional information.\n\u2022A $99 million increase in cash from Changes in Regulatory Assets driven by timing differences between collections from customers and costs incurred under rate rider recovery mechanisms. See Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for additional information.\n\u2022A $46 million increase primarily due to collateral held against risk management contracts due to pricing movement in the commodities market.\nThese increases in cash were offset by:\n\u2022A $1.6 billion decrease in cash primarily due to increased fuel and purchased power expenses not yet recovered from customers. Approximately $1.1 billion of these expenses are attributable to retail customers and are recorded as deferred fuel regulatory assets. PSO and SWEPCo are working with their respective regulatory commissions to determine the recovery mechanisms, recovery periods as well as the appropriate carrying charges on the regulatory assets. See Note 4 - Rate Matters for additional information.\nInvesting Activities\n2021 Compared to 2020\nNet Cash Flows Used for Investing Activities increased by $200 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $767 million increase due to the acquisition of the Dry Lake Solar Project and the NCWF. See Note 7 - Acquisitions, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nThis increase in cash used was partially offset by:\n\u2022A $587 million decrease in construction expenditures, primarily due to decreases in Transmission and Distribution Utilities of $342 million, AEP Transmission Holdco of $181 million and Generation & Marketing of $79 million.\nFinancing Activities\n2021 Compared to 2020\nNet Cash Flows from Financing Activities increased by $200 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022An $860 million increase in issuances of long-term debt. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\n\u2022A $494 million increase in short-term debt primarily due to decreased repayments of commercial paper. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\n\u2022A $446 million increase in issuances of common stock primarily under AEP\u2019s ATM offering program. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\n\u2022A $100 million increase due to the redemption of noncontrolling interests in Desert Sky Wind Farm LLC and Trent Wind Farm LLC as well as the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in Santa Rita East in 2020. See Note 7 - Acquisitions, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nThese increases in cash were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $1.6 billion decrease due to increased retirements of long-term debt. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\nThe following financing activities occurred during 2021:\nAEP Common Stock:\n\u2022During 2021, AEP issued 7.6 million shares of common stock under the ATM offering program, incentive compensation, employee saving and dividend reinvestment plans and received net proceeds of $601 million.\nDebt:\n\u2022During 2021, AEP issued approximately $6.5 billion of long-term debt, including $5 billion of senior unsecured notes at interest rates ranging from 1.625% to 3.45%, $750 million of junior subordinated debenture notes at an interest rate of 3.875%, $40 million of pollution control bonds at an interest rate of 0.75% and $743 million of other debt at various interest rates. The proceeds from these issuances were primarily used to fund long-term debt maturities, construction programs and to help address working capital needs.\n\u2022During 2021, AEP entered into interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling $300 million that were designated as cash flow hedges. During 2021, settlements of AEP\u2019s interest rate derivatives resulted in net cash received of $17 million for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2021, AEP had a total notional amount of $950 million of outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges.\nSee \u201cLong-term Debt Subsequent Events\u201d section of Note 14 for Long-term debt and other securities issued, retired and principal payments made after December 31, 2021 through February 24, 2022, the date that the 10-K was issued.\nBUDGETED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nManagement forecasts approximately $7.6 billion of capital expenditures in 2022. For the four year period, 2023 through 2026, management forecasts capital expenditures of $30.7 billion. The expenditures are generally for transmission, generation, distribution, regulated renewables and required environmental investment to comply with the Federal EPA rules. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain issues, weather, legal reviews and the ability to access capital. Management expects to fund these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sale of Kentucky operations and financing activities. Generally, the Registrant Subsidiaries use cash or short-term borrowings under the money pool to fund these expenditures until long-term funding is arranged. The 2022 estimated capital expenditures include generation, transmission and distribution related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations as follows:\n(a)Amount primarily consists of facilities, software and telecommunications.\n(b)Amount includes $66 million and $3 million of budgeted capital expenditures for KPCo and KTCo, respectively, which are expected to occur prior to the anticipated closing of the sale transaction in the second quarter of 2022. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nThe table below represents estimated capital investments by business segment for the years 2023 to 2026:\nThe 2022 estimated capital expenditures by Registrant Subsidiary include distribution, transmission and generation-related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations as follows:\n(a) Amount primarily consists of facilities, software and telecommunications.\nCYBER SECURITY\nThe electric utility industry is an identified critical infrastructure function with mandatory cyber security requirements under the authority of FERC. The NERC, which FERC certified as the nation\u2019s Electric Reliability Organization, developed mandatory critical infrastructure protection cyber security reliability standards. AEP\u2019s service territory covers multiple NERC regions, and is audited at least annually by one or more of the regions. AEP began participating in the NERC grid security and emergency response exercises, GridEx, in 2013 and continues to participate in the bi-yearly exercises. These efforts, led by NERC, test and further develop the coordination, threat sharing and interaction between utilities and various government agencies relative to potential cyber and physical threats against the nation\u2019s electric grid. AEP also conducts internal exercises to test and further develop AEP\u2019s cyber response plans. These internal scenarios are chosen based on real world events and often include coordination with and communication to AEP\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and executive team.\nThe operations of AEP\u2019s electric utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cyber and physical security requirements that are developed and enforced by NERC to protect grid security and reliability. AEP\u2019s Enterprise Security program includes cyber and physical security and uses the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework as a guideline. AEP\u2019s Chief Security & Privacy Officer (CSPO) is also its NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection Senior Manager, ensuring alignment of compliance with the Enterprise Security program.\nCritical cyber assets, such as data centers, power plants, transmission operations centers and business networks are protected using multiple layers of cyber security controls and authentication. Cyber hackers and other malicious actors have caused material disruption by successfully breaching a number of very secure facilities, including federal agencies, banks and retailers. As understanding of these events develop, AEP has adopted a defense in depth approach to cyber security and continually assesses its cyber security tools and processes to determine where to strengthen its defenses. These strategies include monitoring, alerting and emergency response, forensic analysis, disaster recovery, threat sharing and criminal activity reporting. This approach has allowed AEP to deal with cyber and related threats, intrusions and attempted breaches in real-time and to limit their impact to levels that would be expected in the ordinary course of business in the absence of such malicious activity.\nAEP has undertaken a variety of actions to monitor and address cyber-related risks. Cyber security and the effectiveness of AEP\u2019s cyber security processes are reviewed annually with the Board of Directors and at several meetings throughout the year with the committees of the Board that exercise oversight with respect to these matters, including the Audit Committee and the Technology Committee. AEP\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and executive team participate in interactive threat briefings from AEP\u2019s CSPO and security leadership team on a monthly basis. AEP\u2019s strategy and procedure for managing cyber-related risks is integrated within its enterprise risk management processes. These procedures are designed to include that any material information regarding potentially relevant cyber incidents are elevated both to the appropriate leadership in a timely manner as well as, where applicable, our external financial reporting and disclosure team. AEP enterprise security continually adjusts staff and resources in response to the evolving threat landscape, and while such costs are material, they have remained stable and that pattern is expected to continue. In addition, AEP maintains cyber liability insurance to cover certain damages caused by cyber incidents.\nAEP\u2019s CSPO leads the cyber security and physical security teams and is responsible for the design, implementation and execution of AEP\u2019s security risk management strategy, which includes cyber security. AEP\u2019s cyber security team operates a 24/7 Cyber Security Intelligence and Response Center responsible for monitoring the AEP System for cyber risks and threats. The cyber security team constantly scans the AEP System for risks and threats. In addition, under the direction of the CSPO, the cyber security team actively monitors best practices, performs penetration testing, leads response exercises and internal campaigns and provides training and communication across the organization. AEP\u2019s security awareness training is mandatory for all employees, and includes monthly phish email testing to train employees to identify malicious emails that could put AEP at risk.\nAEP also continually reviews its business continuity plan to develop an effective recovery strategy that seeks to decrease response times, limit financial impacts and maintain customer confidence during any business interruption. The cyber security team administers a third-party risk governance program that identifies potential risks introduced\nthrough third-party relationships, such as vendors, software and hardware manufacturers or professional service providers. As warranted, AEP obtains certain contractual security guarantees and assurances with these third-party relationships to help ensure the security and safety of its information. The cyber security team works closely with a broad range of departments, including legal, regulatory, corporate communications, audit services, information technology and operational technology functions critical to the power grid.\nThe cyber security team collaborates with partners from both industry and government, and routinely participates in industry-wide programs that exchange knowledge of threats with utility peers, industry and federal agencies. AEP is an active member of a number of industry specific threat and information sharing communities including the Department of Homeland Security and the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center. AEP continues to work with nonaffiliated entities to do penetration testing and to design and implement appropriate remediation strategies. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent interruption of services or other damages to AEP's business or operations in connection with any cyber-related incident.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including amounts related to legal matters and contingencies. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n\u2022It requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and\n\u2022Changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on net income or financial condition.\nManagement discusses the development and selection of critical accounting estimates as presented below with the Audit Committee of AEP\u2019s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee reviews the disclosures relating to them.\nManagement believes that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate. However, actual results can differ significantly from those estimates.\nThe sections that follow present information about critical accounting estimates, as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate.\nRegulatory Accounting\nNature of Estimates Required\nThe Registrants\u2019 financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated.\nThe Registrants recognize regulatory assets (deferred expenses to be recovered in the future) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) for the economic effects of regulation. Specifically, the timing of expense and income recognition is matched with regulated revenues. Liabilities are also recorded for refunds, or probable refunds, to customers that have not been made.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nWhen incurred costs are probable of recovery through regulated rates, regulatory assets are recorded on the balance sheets. Management reviews the probability of recovery at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur. Similarly, regulatory liabilities are recorded when a determination is made that a refund is probable or when ordered by a commission. Examples of new events that affect probability include changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation. The assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs as well as the return of revenues, rate of return earned on invested capital and timing and amount of assets to be recovered through regulated rates. If recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, that regulatory asset is written-off as a charge against earnings. A write-off of regulatory assets or establishment of a regulatory liability may also reduce future cash flows since there will be no recovery through regulated rates.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nA change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on net income. See Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for additional information related to regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues\nNature of Estimates Required\nAEP recognizes revenues from customers as the performance obligations of delivering energy to customers are satisfied. The determination of sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue accrual is recorded. This estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings. PSO and SWEPCo do not include the fuel portion in unbilled revenue in accordance with the applicable state commission regulatory treatment in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.\nAccrued unbilled revenues for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $246 million and $288 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP\u2019s Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $(42) million, $40 million and $(7) million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.\nAccrued unbilled revenues for the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment were $172 million and $171 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP\u2019s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment were $1 million, $5 million and $(12) million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.\nAccrued unbilled revenues for the Generation & Marketing segment were $110 million and $86 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment were $24 million, $11 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nFor each Registrant except AEPTCo, the monthly estimate for unbilled revenues is based upon a primary computation of net generation (generation plus purchases less sales) less the current month\u2019s billed KWh and estimated line losses, plus the prior month\u2019s unbilled KWh. However, due to the potential for meter reading issues, meter drift and other anomalies, a secondary computation is made, based upon an allocation of billed KWh to the current month and previous month, on a billing cycle-by-cycle basis, and by dividing the current month aggregated result by the billed KWh. The two methodologies are evaluated to confirm that they are not statistically different.\nFor AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment, management calculates unbilled revenues based on a primary computation of load as provided by PJM less the current month\u2019s billed KWh and estimated line losses, plus the prior month\u2019s unbilled KWh. However, due to the potential for meter reading issues, meter drift and other anomalies, a secondary computation is made, based upon using the most recent historic daily activity on a per contract basis. The two methodologies are evaluated to confirm that they are not statistically different.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nIf the two methodologies used to estimate unbilled revenue are statistically different, a limiter adjustment is made to bring the primary computation within one standard deviation of the secondary computation. Additionally, significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period, weather, line losses or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the estimate of unbilled revenue.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nNature of Estimates Required\nManagement considers fair value techniques, valuation adjustments related to credit and liquidity and judgments related to the probability of forecasted transactions occurring within the specified time period to be critical accounting estimates. These estimates are considered significant because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nThe Registrants measure the fair values of derivative instruments and hedge instruments accounted for using MTM accounting based primarily on exchange prices and broker quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, the fair value is estimated based on the best market information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes and other assumptions. Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. These uncertainties include forward market price assumptions.\nThe Registrants reduce fair values by estimated valuation adjustments for items such as discounting, liquidity and credit quality. Liquidity adjustments are calculated by utilizing bid/ask spreads to estimate the potential fair value impact of liquidating open positions over a reasonable period of time. Credit adjustments on risk management contracts are calculated using estimated default probabilities and recovery rates relative to the counterparties or counterparties with similar credit profiles and contractual netting agreements.\nWith respect to hedge accounting, management assesses hedge effectiveness and evaluates a forecasted transaction\u2019s probability of occurrence within the specified time period as provided in the original hedge documentation.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nThere is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets. Therefore, it is possible that results in future periods may be materially different as contracts settle.\nThe probability that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur by the end of the specified time period could change operating results by requiring amounts currently classified in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to be classified into operating income.\nFor additional information see Note 10 - Derivatives and Hedging and Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements. See \u201cFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1 for AEP\u2019s fair value calculation policy.\nLong-Lived Assets\nNature of Estimates Required\nIn accordance with the requirements of \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d accounting guidance and \u201cRegulated Operations\u201d accounting guidance, the Registrants evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstance include planned abandonments, probable disallowances for rate-making purposes of assets determined to be recently completed plant and assets that meet the held-for-sale criteria. The Registrants utilize a group composite method of depreciation to estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets.\nAn impairment evaluation of a long-lived, held and used asset may result from an abandonment, significant decreases in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as other economic or operations analyses. If the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable, the Registrants record an impairment to the extent that the fair value of the asset is less than its book value. Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the non-discounted and discounted future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value, in some instances) associated with the asset. Assets held for sale must be measured at the lower of the book value or fair value less cost to sell. An impairment is recognized if an asset\u2019s fair value less costs to sell is less than its book value. Any impairment charge is recorded as a reduction to earnings.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nThe fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, the Registrants estimate fair value using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow projections or other market indicators of fair value such as bids received, comparable sales or independent appraisals. Cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made. Estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. Also, when measuring fair value, management evaluates the characteristics of the asset or liability to determine if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Such characteristics include, for example, the condition and location of the asset or restrictions on the use of the asset. The Registrants perform depreciation studies that include a review of any external factors that may affect the useful life to determine composite depreciation rates and related lives which are subject to periodic review by state regulatory commissions for regulated assets. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nIn connection with the evaluation of long-lived assets in accordance with the requirements of \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d accounting guidance, the fair value of the asset can vary if different estimates and assumptions are used in the applied valuation techniques. Estimates for depreciation rates contemplate the history of interim capital replacements and the amount of salvage expected. In cases of impairment, the best estimate of fair value was made using valuation methods based on the most current information at that time. Fluctuations in realized sales proceeds versus the estimated fair value of the asset are generally due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, differences in subsequent market conditions, the level of bidder interest, the timing and terms of the transactions and management\u2019s analysis of the benefits of the transaction.\nPension and OPEB\nAEP maintains a qualified, defined benefit pension plan (Qualified Plan), which covers substantially all nonunion and certain union employees, and unfunded, non-qualified supplemental plans (Nonqualified Plans) to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted under the provisions of the tax law for participants in the Qualified Plan (collectively the Pension Plans). AEP also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Pension Plans and OPEB plans are collectively referred to as the Plans.\nFor a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy, see \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d and \u201cFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities\u201d sections of Note 1. See Note 8 - Benefit Plans for information regarding costs and assumptions for the Plans.\nThe following table shows the net periodic cost (credit) of the Plans:\nYears Ended December 31,\nNet Periodic Cost (Credit) 2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nPension Plans $ 138.2 $ 108.6 $ 61.5\nOPEB (122.0) (109.7) (80.7)\nThe net periodic benefit cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on the Plans\u2019 assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for 2022, management evaluated input from actuaries and investment consultants, including their reviews of asset class return expectations as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Management also considered historical returns of the investment markets and tax rates which affect a portion of the OPEB plans\u2019 assets. Management anticipates that the investment managers employed for the Plans will invest the assets to generate future returns averaging 5.25% for the Qualified Plan and 5.5% for the OPEB plans.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on the Plans\u2019 assets is based on management\u2019s targeted asset allocation and expected investment returns for each investment category. Assumptions for the Plans are summarized in the following table:\nManagement regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the investments to the targeted allocation. Management believes that 5.25% for the Qualified Plan and 5.5% for the OPEB plans are reasonable estimates of the long-term rate of return on the Plans\u2019 assets. The Pension Plans\u2019 assets had an actual gain of 5.41% and 16.91% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The OPEB plans\u2019 assets had an actual gain of 8.67% and 16.33% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Management will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust the assumptions as necessary.\nAEP bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2021, AEP had cumulative gains of approximately $389 million for the Qualified Plan that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets. These unrecognized market-related net actuarial gains may result in decreases in the future pension costs depending on several factors, including whether such gains at each measurement date exceed the corridor in accordance with \u201cCompensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d accounting guidance.\nThe method used to determine the discount rate that AEP utilizes for determining future obligations is a duration-based method in which a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan liability. The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio is used as the discount rate for the plan. The discount rate as of December 31, 2021 under this method was 2.9% for the Qualified Plan, 2.75% for the Nonqualified Plans and 2.9% for the OPEB plans. Due to the effect of the unrecognized net actuarial losses and based on an expected rate of return on the Pension Plans\u2019 assets of 5.25%, discount rates of 2.9% and 2.75% and various other assumptions, management estimates that the pension costs for the Pension Plans will approximate $85 million, $64 million and $34 million in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Based on an expected rate of return on the OPEB plans\u2019 assets of 5.5%, a discount rate of 2.9% and various other assumptions, management estimates OPEB plan credits will approximate $145 million, $138 million and $90 million in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Future actual costs will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the Plans. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results. The effects of a 50 basis point change to selective actuarial assumptions are included in the \u201cEffect if Different Assumptions Used\u201d section below.\nThe value of AEP\u2019s Pension Plans\u2019 assets decreased to $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 from $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower investment returns than benefit payments made in 2021. During 2021, the Qualified Plan paid $443 million and the Nonqualified Plans paid $7 million in benefits to plan participants. The value of AEP\u2019s OPEB plans\u2019 assets increased to $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 from $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to higher investment returns than benefit payments made in 2021. The OPEB plans paid $126 million in benefits to plan participants during 2021.\nNature of Estimates Required\nAEP sponsors pension and OPEB plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. These benefits are accounted for under \u201cCompensation\u201d and \u201cPlan Accounting\u201d accounting guidance. The measurement of pension and OPEB obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nThe critical assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors:\n\u2022Discount rate\n\u2022Compensation increase rate\n\u2022Cash balance crediting rate\n\u2022Health care cost trend rate\n\u2022Expected return on plan assets\nOther assumptions, such as retirement, mortality and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nThe actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans of participants or higher or lower lump sum versus annuity payout elections by plan participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and OPEB expense recorded. If a 50 basis point change were to occur for the following assumptions, the approximate effect on the financial statements would be as follows:\nNA Not applicable.\nSIGNIFICANT TAX LEGISLATION\nIn March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the \u201cAmerican Rescue Plan\u201d) was signed into law. The American Rescue Plan was a COVID-19 relief package that addressed a variety of topics, including the non-deductibility of certain executive compensation. Specifically, the American Rescue Plan changes the officers subject to IRS Section 162(m) from the CEO, CFO, and three top paid officers to the CEO, CFO, and eight top paid officers beginning in 2027.\nIRS Notice 2021-41 was issued on June 29, 2021 by the IRS providing further extension of the continuity safe harbor for PTC and ITC-eligible projects and revising the facts and circumstances rules. For PTC and ITC-eligible projects for which construction began in calendar years 2016 through 2019, the continuity safe harbor was extended to six years. Prior guidance (Notice 2020-41) had only extended the safe harbor for projects beginning in 2016 and 2017 to 5 years. Furthermore, for PTC and ITC-eligible projects for which construction began in 2020, the continuity safe harbor was extended to five years. Under a facts and circumstances analysis, the continuity requirement may be satisfied under either the continuous construction test or the continuous efforts test, regardless of whether the physical work test or the five percent safe harbor is applied.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 2 - New Accounting Standards for information related to accounting standards. There are no new standards expected to have a material impact to the Registrants\u2019 financial statements.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risks\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities segment is exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through transactions in power, coal, natural gas and marketing contracts. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.\nThe Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment is exposed to energy procurement risk and interest rate risk.\nThe Generation & Marketing segment conducts marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. This segment is exposed to certain market risks as a marketer of wholesale and retail electricity. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. In addition, the Generation & Marketing segment is also exposed to certain market risks as a power producer and through transactions in wholesale electricity, natural gas and marketing contracts.\nManagement employs risk management contracts including physical forward and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts. Management engages in risk management of power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business. As a result, AEP is subject to price risk. The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. AEPSC\u2019s market risk oversight staff independently monitors risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of the Commercial Operations Risk Committee (Regulated Risk Committee) and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports regarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures. The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President of Generation, Senior Vice President of Grid Solutions, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk and Chief Risk Officer. The Competitive Risk Committee consists of AEPSC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk and Chief Risk Officer in addition to Energy Supply\u2019s President and Senior Vice President. When commercial activities exceed predetermined limits, positions are modified to reduce the risk to be within the limits unless specifically approved by the respective committee.\nThe effects of COVID-19 continue to be monitored, and while markets have shown improvement, credit risks remain as counterparties encounter business and supply chain disruptions.\nDue to multiple defaults of market participants, ERCOT had a large outstanding unpaid balance associated with the February 2021 winter storm. A certain portion of this balance has been securitized and disbursed to impacted market participants. Financial costs associated with securitization are allocated to load serving entities through their qualified scheduling entities and in that role AEPEP is exposed, but not materially. If the market rules were to change on how socialized losses are allocated this could affect AEPEP\u2019s exposure. Regardless of the approach of how socialized losses are allocated there are potential downstream impacts that could push counterparties into financial distress and or bankruptcy, affecting AEPEP, AEP Texas and ETT.\nThe following table summarizes the reasons for changes in total MTM value as compared to December 31, 2020:\n(a)Reflects fair value on primarily long-term structured contracts which are typically with customers that seek fixed pricing to limit their risk against fluctuating energy prices. The contract prices are valued against market curves associated with the delivery location and delivery term. A significant portion of the total volumetric position has been economically hedged.\n(b)Market fluctuations are attributable to various factors such as supply/demand, weather, etc.\n(c)Relates to the net gains (losses) of those contracts that are not reflected on the statements of income. These net gains (losses) are recorded as regulatory liabilities/assets or accounts payable.\n(d)MTM risk management contract net assets relating to KPCo are classified as Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nSee Note 10 - Derivatives and Hedging and Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to risk management contracts. The following tables and discussion provide information on credit risk and market volatility risk.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is mitigated in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis.\nAEP has risk management contracts (includes non-derivative contracts) with numerous counterparties. Since open risk management contracts are valued based on changes in market prices of the related commodities, exposures change daily. As of December 31, 2021, credit exposure net of collateral to sub investment grade counterparties was approximately 0.8%, expressed in terms of net MTM assets, net receivables and the net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM (representing economic risk even though there may not be risk of accounting\nloss). As of December 31, 2021, the following table approximates AEP\u2019s counterparty credit quality and exposure based on netting across commodities, instruments and legal entities where applicable:\nAll exposure in the table above relates to AEPSC and AEPEP as AEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of certain AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries and AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries.\nIn addition, AEP is exposed to credit risk related to participation in RTOs. For each of the RTOs in which AEP participates, this risk is generally determined based on the proportionate share of member gross activity over a specified period of time.\nValue at Risk (VaR) Associated with Risk Management Contracts\nManagement uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR, to measure AEP\u2019s commodity price risk in the risk management portfolio. The VaR is based on the variance-covariance method using historical prices to estimate volatilities and correlations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period. Based on this VaR analysis, as of December 31, 2021, a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows or financial condition.\nManagement calculates the VaR for both a trading and non-trading portfolio. The trading portfolio consists primarily of contracts related to energy trading and marketing activities. The non-trading portfolio consists primarily of economic hedges of generation and retail supply activities.\nThe following tables show the end, high, average and low market risk as measured by VaR for the periods indicated:\nVaR Model\nTrading Portfolio\nTwelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nEnd High Average Low End High Average Low\n(in millions) (in millions)\n$ 0.4 $ 3.6 $ 0.4 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.3 $ 0.1 $ -\nVaR Model\nNon-Trading Portfolio\nTwelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nEnd High Average Low End High Average Low\n(in millions) (in millions)\n$ 8.3 $ 14.9 $ 3.7 $ 0.7 $ 2.2 $ 2.9 $ 1.0 $ 0.1\nManagement back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements. Based on the assumed 95% confidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every 20 trading days.\nAs the VaR calculation captures recent price movements, management also performs regular stress testing of the trading portfolio to understand AEP\u2019s exposure to extreme price movements. A historical-based method is employed whereby the current trading portfolio is subjected to actual, observed price movements from the last several years in order to ascertain which historical price movements translated into the largest potential MTM loss. Management then researches the underlying positions, price movements and market events that created the most significant exposure and reports the findings to the Risk Executive Committee, Regulated Risk Committee or Competitive Risk Committee as appropriate.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAEP is exposed to interest rate market fluctuations in the normal course of business operations. AEP has outstanding short and long-term debt which is subject to a variable rate. AEP manages interest rate risk by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt, by entering into interest rate derivative instruments and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on AEP\u2019s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by $33 million, $32 million and $24 million, respectively.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nAmerican Electric Power Company, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2021, there were $4.8 billion of deferred costs included in regulatory assets, $1.0 billion of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $8.7 billion of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reduction, $0.3 billion of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant evidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assessment of probability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and liabilities, involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application of relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\nValuation of Level 3 Risk Management Commodity Contracts\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company employs risk management commodity contracts including physical and financial forward purchase and sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, over-the-counter swaps and options to accomplish its risk management strategies. Certain over-the-counter and bilaterally executed derivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. As disclosed by management, the fair value of these risk management commodity contracts is estimated based on the best market information available, including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, and other assumptions. Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment including forward market price assumptions. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. Management utilized such unobservable pricing inputs to value its Level 3 risk management commodity contract assets and liabilities, which totaled $245.5 million and $148.2 million, as of December 31, 2021, respectively.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of Level 3 risk management commodity contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the commodity contracts; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the forward market price assumptions used in management\u2019s valuation models. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s valuation of the risk management commodity contracts, including controls over the assumptions used to value the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the fair value of the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models, evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions, and testing the data used by management in the valuation models. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 24, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (AEP) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management.

Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2021, there were $293.0 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets, $3.8 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $1.0 billion of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reduction, $0.2 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant evidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assessment of probability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and liabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application of relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\nValuation of Level 3 Risk Management Commodity Contracts\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company employs risk management commodity contracts including physical and financial forward purchase and sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, over-the-counter swaps and options to accomplish its risk management strategies. Certain over-the-counter and bilaterally executed derivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. As disclosed by management, the fair value of these risk management commodity contracts is estimated based on the best market information available, including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, and other assumptions. Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment including forward market price assumptions. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. Management utilized such unobservable pricing inputs to value its Level 3 risk management commodity contract liabilities, which totaled $92.5 million, as of December 31, 2021.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of Level 3 risk management commodity contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the commodity contracts; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the forward market price assumptions used in management\u2019s valuation models. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s valuation of the risk management commodity contracts, including controls over the assumptions used to value the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the fair value of the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models, evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions, and testing the data used by management in the valuation models. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 24, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Ohio Power Company and Subsidiaries (OPCo) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company\u2019s financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2021, there were $1.2 billion of deferred costs included in regulatory assets, $14.2 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $835.3 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reduction, $56.2 million of which are pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant evidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assessment of probability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and liabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application of relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 24, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The following list indicates Registrants to which the notes apply. Specific disclosures within each note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\n1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nORGANIZATION\nThe Registrants engage in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power. The Registrant Subsidiaries that conduct most of these activities are regulated by the FERC under the Federal Power Act and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and maintain accounts in accordance with the FERC and other regulatory guidelines. Most of these companies are subject to further regulation with regard to rates and other matters by state regulatory commissions.\nAEP provides competitive electric and gas supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers in deregulated electricity markets and also provides energy management solutions throughout the United States, including energy efficiency services through its independent retail electric supplier.\nThe Registrants also engage in wholesale electricity, natural gas and other commodity marketing and risk management activities in the United States and provide various energy-related services. In addition, AEP operates competitive wind and solar farms. I&M provides barging services to both affiliated and nonaffiliated companies. SWEPCo, through Sabine, conducts lignite mining operations to fuel the Pirkey Plant.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRates and Service Regulation\nAEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries\u2019 rates are regulated by the FERC and state regulatory commissions in the eleven state operating territories in which they operate. The FERC also regulates the Registrants\u2019 affiliated transactions, including AEPSC intercompany service billings which are generally at cost, under the 2005 Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act. The FERC also has jurisdiction over certain issuances and acquisitions of securities of the public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company. The state regulatory commissions also regulate certain intercompany transactions under various orders and affiliate statutes. Both the FERC and state regulatory commissions are permitted to review and audit the relevant books and records of companies within a public utility holding company system.\nThe FERC regulates wholesale power markets and wholesale power transactions. The Registrants\u2019 wholesale power transactions are generally market-based. Wholesale power transactions are cost-based regulated when a cost-based contract is negotiated and filed with the FERC or the FERC determines that the Registrants have \u201cmarket power\u201d in the region where the transaction occurs. Wholesale power supply contracts have been entered into with various municipalities and cooperatives that are FERC-regulated, cost-based contracts. These contracts are generally formula rate mechanisms, which are trued-up to actual costs annually.\nThe state regulatory commissions regulate all of the retail distribution operations and rates of the Registrants\u2019 retail public utility subsidiaries on a cost basis. The state regulatory commissions also regulate the retail generation/power supply operations and rates except in Ohio and the ERCOT region of Texas. For generation in Ohio, customers who have not switched to a CRES provider for generation pay market-based auction rates. In addition, all OPCo distribution customers continue to pay for certain legacy deferred generation-related costs through PUCO approved riders. In the ERCOT region of Texas, the generation/supply business is under customer choice and market pricing is conducted by REPs. AEP has one active REP in ERCOT. AEP\u2019s nonregulated subsidiaries enter into short and long-term wholesale transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in the ERCOT market. In addition, these nonregulated subsidiaries control certain wind assets, the power from which is marketed and sold in ERCOT. Power from the Oklaunion Power Station was also marketed and sold by these nonregulated subsidiaries in ERCOT prior to its retirement in 2020.\nThe FERC also regulates the Registrants\u2019 wholesale transmission operations and rates. Retail transmission rates are based upon the FERC OATT rate when retail rates are unbundled in connection with restructuring. Retail transmission rates are based on formula rates included in the PJM OATT that are cost-based and are unbundled in Ohio for OPCo, in Virginia for APCo and in Michigan for I&M. AEP Texas\u2019 retail transmission rates in Texas are unbundled but the retail transmission rates are regulated, on a cost basis, by the PUCT. Bundled retail transmission rates are regulated, on a cost basis, by the state commissions. Transmission rates for AEPTCo\u2019s seven wholly-owned transmission subsidiaries within the AEP Transmission Holdco segment are based on formula rates included in the applicable RTO\u2019s OATT that are cost-based.\nIn West Virginia, APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis.\nIn addition, the FERC regulates the SIA, Operating Agreement, TA and TCA, all of which allocate shared system costs and revenues among the utility subsidiaries that are parties to each agreement. The FERC also regulates the PCA. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions for additional information.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nAEP\u2019s consolidated financial statements include its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs of which AEP is the primary beneficiary. The consolidated financial statements for AEP Texas include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Transition Funding (consolidated VIEs) and Restoration Funding (a consolidated VIE). The consolidated financial statements for APCo include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding (a consolidated VIE). The consolidated financial statements for I&M include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and DCC Fuel (consolidated VIEs). The consolidated statements of cash flows for OPCo include the Registrant Subsidiary and Ohio Phase-in Recovery Funding (a consolidated VIE) for the year ended December 31, 2019. In July 2019, the Ohio Phase-in Recovery Funding securitization bonds matured. The consolidated financial statements for SWEPCo include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiary and Sabine (a consolidated VIE). Intercompany items are eliminated in consolidation.\nThe equity method of accounting is used for equity investments where the Registrants exercise significant influence but do not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are initially recorded at cost in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets. The proportionate share of the investee\u2019s equity earnings or losses is included in Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on the statements of income.\nAEP, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo have ownership interests in generating units that are jointly-owned. The proportionate share of the operating costs associated with such facilities is included on the income statements and the assets and liabilities are reflected on the balance sheets. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments and Note 18 - Property, Plant and Equipment for additional information. In October 2020, AEP Texas, PSO and a nonaffiliated joint-owner executed an Environmental Liability and Property Transfer and Asset Purchase Agreement with a nonaffiliated third-party related to the Oklaunion Power Station site. See Note 7 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nThe Registrants\u2019 financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. In accordance with accounting guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations,\u201d regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and by matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment, unbilled electricity revenue, valuation of long-term energy contracts, the effects of regulation, long-lived asset recovery, storm costs, the effects of contingencies and certain assumptions made in accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. The estimates and assumptions used are based upon management\u2019s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and Cash Equivalents include temporary cash investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas and APCo)\nRestricted Cash primarily includes funds held by trustees for the payment of securitization bonds.\nReconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash reported within the balance sheets that sum to the total of the same amounts shown on the statement of cash flows:\nOther Temporary Investments (Applies to AEP)\nOther Temporary Investments primarily include marketable securities and investments by its protected cell of EIS. These securities have readily determinable fair values and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification or weighted-average cost method. See \u201cFair Value Measurements of Other Temporary Investments\u201d section of Note 11 for additional information.\nInventory\nFossil fuel inventories are carried at average cost with the exception of AGR, which carries these inventories at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Materials and supplies inventories are carried at average cost.\nAccounts Receivable\nCustomer accounts receivable primarily include receivables from wholesale and retail energy customers, receivables from energy contract counterparties related to risk management activities and customer receivables primarily related to other revenue-generating activities.\nRevenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations of delivering energy to customers are satisfied. To the extent that deliveries have occurred but a bill has not been issued, the Registrants accrue and recognize, as Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the balance sheets, an estimate of the revenues for energy delivered since the last billing.\nAEP Credit factors accounts receivable on a daily basis, excluding receivables from risk management activities, through purchase agreements with I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and a portion of APCo. Since APCo does not have regulatory authority to sell accounts receivable in its West Virginia regulatory jurisdiction, only a portion of APCo\u2019s accounts receivable are sold to AEP Credit. AEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits. Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from bank conduits for the interest in the billed and unbilled receivables they acquire from affiliated utility subsidiaries. See \u201cSecuritized Accounts Receivable - AEP Credit\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nGenerally, AEP Credit records bad debt expense based upon a 12-month rolling average of bad debt write-offs in proportion to gross accounts receivable purchased from participating AEP subsidiaries. The assessment is performed separately by each participating AEP subsidiary, which inherently contemplates any differences in geographical risk characteristics for the allowance. For receivables related to APCo\u2019s West Virginia operations, the bad debt reserve is calculated based on a rolling two-year average write-off in proportion to gross accounts receivable. KPCo terminated selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit in the first quarter of 2022, based on the pending sale to Liberty. As a result of the termination, in the first quarter of 2022, KPCo will record an allowance for uncollectible accounts on its balance sheet for those receivables no longer sold to AEP Credit. For customer accounts receivables relating to risk management activities, accounts receivables are reviewed for bad debt reserves at a specific counterparty level basis. For AEP Texas, bad debt reserves are calculated using the specific identification of receivable balances greater than 120 days delinquent, and for those balances less than 120 days where the collection is doubtful. For miscellaneous accounts receivable, bad debt expense is recorded based upon a 12-month rolling average of bad debt write-offs in proportion to gross accounts receivable, unless specifically identified. In addition to these processes, management contemplates available current information, as well as any reasonable and supportable forecast information, to determine if allowances for uncollectible accounts should be further adjusted in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cCredit Losses.\u201d Management\u2019s assessments contemplate expected losses over the life of the accounts receivable.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries)\nAPCo, I&M, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo do not have any significant customers that comprise 10% or more of their operating revenues. AEP Texas had significant transactions with REPs which on a combined basis account for the following percentages of Total Revenues for the years ended December 31 and Accounts Receivable - Customers as of December 31:\nSignificant Customers of AEP Texas:\nReliant Energy, Direct Energy and TXU Energy (a) 2021 2020 2019\nPercentage of Total Revenues 43 % 46 % 48 %\nPercentage of Accounts Receivable - Customers 41 % 40 % 43 %\n(a)In January 2021, NRG Energy, parent company of Reliant Energy, completed a deal to purchase Direct Energy from Centrica.\nAEPTCo had significant transactions with AEP Subsidiaries which on a combined basis account for the following percentages of Total Revenues for the years ended December 31 and Total Accounts Receivable as of December 31:\nSignificant Customers of AEPTCo:\nAEP Subsidiaries 2021 2020 2019\nPercentage of Total Revenues 79 % 78 % 79 %\nPercentage of Total Accounts Receivable 81 % 78 % 78 %\nThe Registrant Subsidiaries monitor credit levels and the financial condition of their customers on a continuous basis to minimize credit risk. The regulatory commissions allow recovery in rates for a reasonable level of bad debt costs. Management believes adequate provisions for credit loss have been made in the accompanying Registrant Subsidiary financial statements.\nRenewable Energy Credits (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nIn regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants record renewable energy credits (RECs) at cost. For AEP\u2019s competitive generation business, management records RECs at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Registrants follow the inventory model for these RECs. RECs expected to be consumed within one year are reported in Materials and Supplies on the balance sheets. RECs with expected consumption beyond one year are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets. The purchases and sales of RECs are reported in the Operating Activities section of the statements of cash flows. RECs that are consumed to meet applicable state renewable portfolio standards are recorded in Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation at an average cost on the statements of income. The net margin on sales of RECs affects the determination of deferred fuel and REC costs.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nRegulated\nElectric utility property, plant and equipment for rate-regulated operations are stated at original cost. Additions, major replacements and betterments are added to the plant accounts. Under the group composite method of depreciation, continuous interim routine replacements of items such as boiler tubes, pumps, motors, etc. result in original cost retirements, less salvage, being charged to accumulated depreciation. The group composite method of depreciation assumes that on average, asset components are retired at the end of their useful lives and thus there is no gain or loss. The equipment in each primary electric plant account is identified as a separate group. The depreciation rates that are established take into account the past history of interim capital replacements and the amount of removal cost incurred and salvage received. These rates and the related lives are subject to periodic review. Removal costs accrued are typically recorded as regulatory liabilities when the revenue received for removal costs accrued exceeds actual removal costs incurred. The asset removal costs liability is relieved as removal costs are incurred. A regulatory asset balance will occur if actual removal costs incurred exceed accumulated removal costs accrued.\nThe costs of labor, materials and overhead incurred to operate and maintain plant and equipment are included in operating expenses.\nNuclear fuel, including nuclear fuel in the fabrication phase, is included in Other Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets.\nLong-lived assets are required to be tested for impairment when it is determined that the carrying value of the assets may no longer be recoverable or when the assets meet the held-for-sale criteria under the accounting guidance for \u201cImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\u201d When it becomes probable that an asset in-service or an asset under construction will be abandoned and regulatory cost recovery has been disallowed or is not probable, the cost of that asset shall be removed from plant-in-service or CWIP and charged to expense. The fair value of an asset is\nthe amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, as opposed to a forced or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow analysis and appraisals.\nNonregulated\nNonregulated operations generally follow the policies of rate-regulated operations listed above but with the following exceptions. Property, plant and equipment of nonregulated operations are stated at original cost (or as adjusted for any applicable impairments) plus the original cost of property acquired or constructed since the acquisition, less disposals. Normal and routine retirements from the plant accounts, net of salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation for most nonregulated operations under the group composite method of depreciation. A gain or loss would be recorded if the retirement is not considered an interim routine replacement. Removal costs are charged to expense.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalization\nFor regulated operations, AFUDC represents the estimated cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction projects that is capitalized and recovered through depreciation over the service life of regulated electric utility plant. The Registrants record the equity component of AFUDC in Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction and the debt component of AFUDC as a reduction to Interest Expense on the statements of income. For nonregulated operations, including certain generating assets, interest is capitalized during construction in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cCapitalization of Interest.\u201d\nValuation of Nonderivative Financial Instruments\nThe book values of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Advances to/from Affiliates, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Short-term Debt approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe accounting guidance for \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. When quoted market prices are not available, pricing may be completed using comparable securities, dealer values, operating data and general market conditions to determine fair value. Valuation models utilize various inputs such as commodity, interest rate and, to a lesser degree, volatility and credit that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, market corroborated inputs (i.e. inputs derived principally from, or correlated to, observable market data) and other observable inputs for the asset or liability.\nFor commercial activities, exchange-traded derivatives, namely futures contracts, are generally fair valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1. Level 2 inputs primarily consist of OTC broker quotes in moderately active or less active markets, as well as exchange-traded derivatives where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1. Management verifies price curves using these broker quotes and classifies these fair values within Level 2 when substantially all of the fair value can be corroborated. Management typically obtains multiple broker quotes, which are nonbinding in nature but are based on recent trades in the marketplace. When multiple broker quotes are obtained, the quoted bid and ask prices are averaged. In certain circumstances, a broker quote may be discarded if it is a clear outlier. Management uses a historical correlation analysis between the broker quoted location and the illiquid locations. If the points are highly correlated, these locations are included within Level 2 as well. Certain OTC and bilaterally executed derivative\ninstruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. Illiquid transactions, complex structured transactions, FTRs and counterparty credit risk may require nonmarket-based inputs. Some of these inputs may be internally developed or extrapolated and utilized to estimate fair value. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized as Level 3. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. A portion of the Level 3 instruments have been economically hedged which limits potential earnings volatility.\nAEP utilizes its trustee\u2019s external pricing service to estimate the fair value of the underlying investments held in the benefit plan and nuclear trusts. AEP\u2019s investment managers review and validate the prices utilized by the trustee to determine fair value. AEP\u2019s management performs its own valuation testing to verify the fair values of the securities. AEP receives audit reports of the trustee\u2019s operating controls and valuation processes.\nAssets in the benefits and nuclear trusts, cash and cash equivalents, other temporary investments and restricted cash for securitized funding are classified using the following methods. Equities are classified as Level 1 holdings if they are actively traded on exchanges. Items classified as Level 1 are investments in money market funds, fixed income and equity mutual funds and equity securities. They are valued based on observable inputs, primarily unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Items classified as Level 2 are primarily investments in individual fixed income securities. Fixed income securities generally do not trade on exchanges and do not have an official closing price but their valuation inputs are based on observable market data. Pricing vendors calculate bond valuations using financial models and matrices. The models use observable inputs including yields on benchmark securities, quotes by securities brokers, rating agency actions, discounts or premiums on securities compared to par prices, changes in yields for U.S. Treasury securities, corporate actions by bond issuers, prepayment schedules and histories, economic events and, for certain securities, adjustments to yields to reflect changes in the rate of inflation. Other securities with model-derived valuation inputs that are observable are also classified as Level 2 investments. Investments with unobservable valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 investments. Investments classified as Other are valued using Net Asset Value as a practical expedient. Items classified as Other are primarily cash equivalent funds, common collective trusts, commingled funds, structured products, private equity, real estate, infrastructure and alternative credit investments. These investments do not have a readily determinable fair value or they contain redemption restrictions which may include the right to suspend redemptions under certain circumstances. Redemption restrictions may also prevent certain investments from being redeemed at the reporting date for the underlying value.\nDeferred Fuel Costs (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nThe cost of fuel and related emission allowances and emission control chemicals/consumables is charged to Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expense when the fuel is burned or the allowance or consumable is utilized. The cost of fuel also includes the cost of nuclear fuel burned which is computed primarily using the units-of-production method. In regulated jurisdictions with an active FAC, fuel cost over-recoveries (the excess of fuel-related revenues over applicable fuel costs incurred) are generally deferred as current regulatory liabilities and under-recoveries (the excess of applicable fuel costs incurred over fuel-related revenues) are generally deferred as current regulatory assets. Fuel cost over-recovery and under-recovery balances are classified as noncurrent when there is a commission-approved plan to delay refunds or recoveries beyond a one year period. These deferrals are amortized when refunded or when billed to customers in later months with the state regulatory commissions\u2019 review and approval. The amount of an over-recovery or under-recovery can also be affected by actions of the state regulatory commissions. On a routine basis, state regulatory commissions review and/or audit the Registrants\u2019 fuel procurement policies and practices, the fuel cost calculations and FAC deferrals. FAC deferrals are adjusted when costs are no longer probable of recovery or when refunds of fuel reserves are probable. The Registrants share the majority of their Off-system Sales margins to customers either through an active FAC or other rate mechanisms. Where the FAC or Off-system Sales sharing mechanism is capped, frozen or non-existent, changes in fuel costs or sharing of off-system sales impact earnings.\nRevenue Recognition\nRegulatory Accounting\nThe Registrants\u2019 financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses or alternative revenues recognized in accordance with the guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations\u201d) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and by matching revenue with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates.\nWhen regulatory assets are probable of recovery through regulated rates, assets are recorded on the balance sheets. Regulatory assets are reviewed for probability of recovery at each balance sheet date or whenever new events occur. Examples of new events include the issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation. If it is determined that recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, the regulatory asset is derecognized as a charge against income.\nRetail and Wholesale Supply and Delivery of Electricity\nThe Registrants recognize revenues from customers for retail and wholesale electricity sales and electricity transmission and distribution delivery services. The Registrants recognize such revenues on the statements of income as the performance obligations of delivering energy to customers are satisfied. Recognized revenues include both billed and unbilled amounts. In accordance with the applicable state commission\u2019s regulatory treatment, PSO and SWEPCo do not include the fuel portion in unbilled revenue, but rather recognize such revenues when billed to customers.\nWholesale transmission revenue is based on FERC-approved formula rate filings made for each calendar year using estimated costs. Revenues initially recognized per the annual rate filing are compared to actual costs, resulting in the subsequent recognition of an over or under-recovered amount, with interest, that is refunded or recovered, respectively, in a future year\u2019s rates. These annual true-ups meet the definition of alternative revenues in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations\u201d, and are recognized by the Registrants in the second quarter of each calendar year following the filing of annual FERC reports. Any portion of the true-ups applicable to an affiliated company is recorded as Accounts Receivable - Affiliated Companies or Accounts Payable - Affiliated Companies on the balance sheets. Any portion of the true-ups applicable to third-parties is recorded as Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets. See Note 19 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information.\nGross versus Net Presentation of Certain Electricity Supply and Delivery Activities\nMost of the power produced at the generation plants is sold to PJM or SPP. The Registrants also purchase power from PJM and SPP to supply power to customers. Generally, these power sales and purchases are reported on a net basis as revenues on the statements of income. However, purchases of power in excess of sales to PJM or SPP, on an hourly net basis, used to serve retail load are recorded gross as Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income. With the exception of certain dedicated load bilateral power supply contracts, the transactions of AEP\u2019s nonregulated subsidiaries are reported as gross purchases or sales.\nPhysical energy purchases arising from non-derivative contracts are accounted for on a gross basis in Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income. Energy purchases arising from non-trading derivative contracts are recorded based on the transaction\u2019s facts and circumstances. Purchases under non-trading derivatives used to serve accrual based obligations are recorded in Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income. All other non-trading derivative purchases are recorded net in revenues.\nIn general, the Registrants record expenses when purchased electricity is received and when expenses are incurred, with the exception of certain power purchase contracts that are derivatives and accounted for using MTM accounting where generation/supply rates are not cost-based regulated. In jurisdictions where the generation/supply business is subject to cost-based regulation, the unrealized MTM amounts are deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).\nEnergy Marketing and Risk Management Activities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants engage in power, capacity and, to a lesser extent, natural gas marketing as major power producers and participants in electricity and natural gas markets. The Registrants also engage in power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity risk management activities focused on markets where the AEP System owns assets and on adjacent markets. These activities include the purchase-and-sale of energy under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices. These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options. Certain energy marketing and risk management transactions are with RTOs.\nThe Registrants recognize revenues from marketing and risk management transactions that are not derivatives as the performance obligation of delivering the commodity is satisfied. Expenses from marketing and risk management transactions that are not derivatives are also recognized upon delivery of the commodity.\nThe Registrants use MTM accounting for marketing and risk management transactions that are derivatives unless the derivative is designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship or elected normal under the normal purchase normal sale election. Unrealized MTM gains and losses are included on the balance sheets as Risk Management Assets or Liabilities, as appropriate, and on the statements of income in Total Revenues. Realized gains and losses on marketing and risk management transactions are included in revenues or expenses based on the transaction\u2019s facts and circumstances. However, in regulated jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation, unrealized MTM amounts and some realized gains and losses are deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).\nCertain qualifying marketing and risk management derivatives transactions are designated as hedges of variability in future cash flows as a result of forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge). In the event the Registrants designate a cash flow hedge, the cash flow hedge\u2019s gain or loss is initially recorded as a component of AOCI. When the forecasted transaction is realized and affects net income, the Registrants subsequently reclassify the gain or loss on the hedge from AOCI into revenues or expenses within the same financial statement line item as the forecasted transaction on their statements of income. See \u201cAccounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies\u201d section of Note 10 for additional information.\nLevelization of Nuclear Refueling Outage Costs (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nIn accordance with regulatory orders, I&M defers incremental operation and maintenance costs associated with periodic refueling outages at its Cook Plant and amortizes the costs over approximately 18 months, beginning with the month following the start of each unit\u2019s refueling outage and lasting until the end of the month in which the same unit\u2019s next scheduled refueling outage begins.\nMaintenance\nThe Registrants expense maintenance costs as incurred. If it becomes probable that the Registrants will recover specifically-incurred costs through future rates, a regulatory asset is established to match the expensing of those maintenance costs with their recovery in cost-based regulated revenues. In certain regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants defer costs above the level included in base rates and amortize those deferrals commensurate with recovery through rate riders.\nIncome Taxes and Investment and Production Tax Credits\nThe Registrants use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities which will result in a future tax consequence. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nWhen the flow-through method of accounting for temporary differences is required by a regulator to be reflected in regulated revenues (that is, when deferred taxes are not included in the cost-of-service for determining regulated rates for electricity), deferred income taxes are recorded and related regulatory assets and liabilities are established to match the regulated revenues and tax expense.\nAEP and subsidiaries apply the deferral methodology for the recognition of ITCs. Deferred ITCs are amortized to income tax expense over the life of the asset that generated the credit. Amortization of deferred ITCs begins when the asset is placed in-service, except where regulatory commissions reflect ITCs in the rate-making process, then amortization begins when the cash tax benefit is recognized. Alternatively, PTCs reduce income tax expense as they are earned. PTCs are earned when electricity is produced.\nThe Registrants account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cIncome Taxes.\u201d The Registrants classify interest expense or income related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense or income as appropriate and classify penalties as Other Operation expense on the statements of income.\nExcise Taxes (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAs agents for some state and local governments, the Registrants collect from customers certain excise taxes levied by those state or local governments on customers. The Registrants do not record these taxes as revenue or expense.\nDebt\nGains and losses from the reacquisition of debt used to finance regulated electric utility plants are deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the reacquired debt in accordance with their rate-making treatment unless the debt is refinanced. If the reacquired debt associated with the regulated business is refinanced, the reacquisition costs attributable to the portions of the business that are subject to cost-based regulatory accounting are generally deferred and amortized over the term of the replacement debt consistent with its recovery in rates. Operations not subject to cost-based rate regulation report gains and losses on the reacquisition of debt in Interest Expense on the statements of income upon reacquisition.\nDebt discount or premium and debt issuance expenses are deferred and amortized generally utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related debt. The straight-line method approximates the effective interest method and is consistent with the treatment in rates for regulated operations. The net amortization expense is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nGoodwill (Applies to AEP)\nWhen the Registrants acquire a business, as defined by the accounting guidance for \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d management recognizes all acquired assets and liabilities at their fair value. To the extent that consideration exceeds the net fair value of the identified assets and liabilities, goodwill is recognized on the balance sheets. Goodwill is not amortized. Management tests acquired goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually at its estimated fair value. Fair value is the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, management estimates fair value using various internal and external valuation methods.\nPension and OPEB Plans (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAEP sponsors a qualified pension plan and two unfunded non-qualified pension plans. Substantially all AEP employees are covered by the qualified plan or both the qualified and a non-qualified pension plan. AEP also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Registrant Subsidiaries account for their participation in the AEP sponsored pension and OPEB plans using multiple-employer accounting. See Note 8 - Benefit Plans for additional information including significant accounting policies associated with the plans.\nInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAEP has several trust funds with significant investments intended to provide for future payments of pension and OPEB benefits, nuclear decommissioning and SNF disposal. All of the trust funds\u2019 investments are diversified and managed in compliance with all laws and regulations. The investment strategy for the trust funds is to use a diversified portfolio of investments to achieve an acceptable rate of return while managing the investment risk of the assets relative to the associated liabilities. To minimize investment risk, the trust funds are broadly diversified among classes of assets, investment strategies and investment managers. Management regularly reviews the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalances the investments to targeted allocations when appropriate. Investment policies and guidelines allow investment managers in approved strategies to use financial derivatives to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities. The investments are reported at fair value under the \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d accounting guidance.\nBenefit Plans\nAll benefit plan assets are invested in accordance with each plan\u2019s investment policy. The investment policy outlines the investment objectives, strategies and target asset allocations by plan.\nThe investment philosophies for AEP\u2019s benefit plans support the allocation of assets to minimize risks and optimize net returns. Strategies used include:\n\u2022Maintaining a long-term investment horizon.\n\u2022Diversifying assets to help control volatility of returns at acceptable levels.\n\u2022Managing fees, transaction costs and tax liabilities to maximize investment earnings.\n\u2022Using active management of investments where appropriate risk/return opportunities exist.\n\u2022Keeping portfolio structure style-neutral to limit volatility compared to applicable benchmarks.\n\u2022Using alternative asset classes such as real estate and private equity to maximize return and provide additional portfolio diversification.\nThe objective of the investment policy for the pension fund is to maintain the funded status of the plan while providing for growth in the plan assets to offset the growth in the plan liabilities. The current target asset allocations are as follows:\nThe investment policy for each benefit plan contains various investment limitations. The investment policies establish concentration limits for securities and prohibit the purchase of securities issued by AEP (with the exception of proportionate and immaterial holdings of AEP securities in passive index strategies or certain commingled funds). However, the investment policies do not preclude the benefit trust funds from receiving contributions in the form of AEP securities, provided that the AEP securities acquired by each plan may not exceed the limitations imposed by law.\nFor equity investments, the concentration limits are generally as follows:\n\u2022No security in excess of 5% of all equities.\n\u2022Cash equivalents must be less than 10% of an investment manager\u2019s equity portfolio.\n\u2022No individual stock may be more than 10% and 7% for pension and OPEB investments, respectively, of each manager\u2019s equity portfolio.\n\u2022No securities may be bought or sold on margin or other use of leverage.\nFor fixed income investments, each investment manager\u2019s portfolio is compared to investment grade, diversified long and intermediate benchmark indices.\nA portion of the pension assets is invested in real estate funds to provide diversification, add return and hedge against inflation. Real estate properties are illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded. The pension plan uses external real estate investment managers to invest in commingled funds that hold real estate properties. To mitigate investment risk in the real estate portfolio, commingled real estate funds are used to ensure that holdings are diversified by region, property type and risk classification. Real estate holdings include core, value-added and opportunistic classifications.\nA portion of the pension assets is invested in private equity. Private equity investments add return and provide diversification and typically require a long-term time horizon to evaluate investment performance. Private equity is classified as an alternative investment because it is illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded. The pension plan uses limited partnerships to invest across the private equity investment spectrum. The private equity holdings are with multiple general partners who help monitor the investments and provide investment selection expertise. The holdings are currently comprised of venture capital, buyout and hybrid debt and equity investments.\nAEP participates in a securities lending program with BNY Mellon to provide incremental income on idle assets and to provide income to offset custody fees and other administrative expenses. AEP lends securities to borrowers approved by BNY Mellon in exchange for collateral. All loans are collateralized by at least 102% of the loaned asset\u2019s market value and the collateral is invested. The difference between the rebate owed to the borrower and the collateral rate of return determines the earnings on the loaned security. The securities lending program\u2019s objective is to provide modest incremental income with a limited increase in risk. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of securities on loan as part of the program was $137 million and $177 million, respectively. Cash and securities obtained as collateral exceeded the fair value of the securities loaned as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nTrust owned life insurance (TOLI) underwritten by The Prudential Insurance Company is held in the OPEB plan trusts. The strategy for holding life insurance contracts in the taxable Voluntary Employees\u2019 Beneficiary Association trust is to minimize taxes paid on the asset growth in the trust. Earnings on plan assets are tax-deferred within the TOLI contract and can be tax-free if held until claims are paid. Life insurance proceeds remain in the trust and are used to fund future retiree medical benefit liabilities. With consideration to other investments held in the trust, the cash value of the TOLI contracts is invested in two diversified funds. A portion is invested in a commingled fund with underlying investments in stocks that are actively traded on major international equity exchanges. The other portion of the TOLI cash value is invested in a diversified, commingled fixed income fund with underlying investments in government bonds, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nCash and cash equivalents are held in each trust to provide liquidity and meet short-term cash needs. Cash equivalent funds are used to provide diversification and preserve principal. The underlying holdings in the cash\nfunds are investment grade money market instruments including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, treasury bills and other types of investment grade short-term debt securities. The cash funds are valued each business day and provide daily liquidity.\nNuclear Trust Funds (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nNuclear decommissioning and SNF trust funds represent funds that regulatory commissions allow I&M to collect through rates to fund future decommissioning and SNF disposal liabilities. By rules or orders, the IURC, the MPSC and the FERC established investment limitations and general risk management guidelines. In general, limitations include:\n\u2022Acceptable investments (rated investment grade or above when purchased).\n\u2022Maximum percentage invested in a specific type of investment.\n\u2022Prohibition of investment in obligations of AEP, I&M or their affiliates.\n\u2022Withdrawals permitted only for payment of decommissioning costs and trust expenses.\nI&M maintains trust funds for each regulatory jurisdiction. Regulatory approval is required to withdraw decommissioning funds. These funds are managed by an external investment manager that must comply with the guidelines and rules of the applicable regulatory authorities. The trust assets are invested to optimize the net of tax earnings of the trust giving consideration to liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives.\nI&M records securities held in these trust funds in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on its balance sheets. I&M records these securities at fair value. I&M classifies debt securities in the trust funds as available-for-sale due to their long-term purpose.\nOther-than-temporary impairments for investments in debt securities are considered realized losses as a result of securities being managed by an external investment management firm. The external investment management firm makes specific investment decisions regarding the debt and equity investments held in these trusts and generally intends to sell debt securities in an unrealized loss position as part of a tax optimization strategy. Impairments reduce the cost basis of the securities which will affect any future unrealized gain or realized gain or loss due to the adjusted cost of investment. I&M records unrealized gains, unrealized losses and other-than-temporary impairments from securities in these trust funds as adjustments to the regulatory liability account for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and to regulatory assets or liabilities for the SNF disposal trust funds in accordance with their treatment in rates. Consequently, changes in fair value of trust assets do not affect earnings or AOCI. See the \u201cNuclear Contingencies\u201d section of Note 6 for additional discussion of nuclear matters. See \u201cFair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal\u201d section of Note 11 for disclosure of the fair value of assets within the trusts.\nComprehensive Income (Loss) (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income (loss) has two components: net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nAs of December 31, 2021, AEP had performance shares and restricted stock units outstanding under the American Electric Power System 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2015 LTIP). Upon vesting, all outstanding performance shares and restricted stock units settle in AEP common stock. Performance units awarded prior to 2017 and restricted stock units granted after January 1, 2013 and prior to January 1, 2017 that vested to executive officers were settled in cash. During 2019, all of the remaining performance units and restricted stock units that settle in\ncash were settled. The impact of AEP\u2019s stock-based compensation plans are insignificant to the financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.\nAEP maintains a variety of tax qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans for employees and non-employee directors that include, among other options, an investment in or an investment return equivalent to that of AEP common stock. This includes AEP career shares maintained under the American Electric Power System Stock Ownership Requirement Plan (SORP), which facilitates executives in meeting minimum stock ownership requirements assigned to them by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. AEP career shares are derived from vested performance shares granted to employees under the 2015 LTIP and previous long-term incentive plans. AEP career shares accrue additional dividend shares in an amount equal to dividends paid on AEP common shares at the closing market price on the dividend payments date. All AEP career shares are settled in shares of AEP common stock after the executive\u2019s service with AEP ends.\nPerformance shares awarded after January 1, 2017 are classified as temporary equity in the Mezzanine Equity section of the balance sheets until the awards vest. Upon vesting, the performance shares are classified as permanent equity. These awards may be settled in cash upon an employee\u2019s qualifying termination due to a change in control. Because such event is not solely within the control of the company, these awards are classified outside of permanent equity until the awards vest.\nAEP compensates their non-employee directors, in part, with stock units under the American Electric Power Company, Inc. Stock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. These stock units were payable in cash to directors after their service ends. Effective in June 2022, these stock units become payable in AEP common stock rather than cash.\nManagement measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. For share-based payment awards with service only vesting conditions, management recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis. Stock-based compensation expense recognized on the statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is based on the number of outstanding awards at the end of each period without a reduction for estimated forfeitures. AEP accounts for forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, compensation cost is included in Net Income for the performance shares, career shares, restricted stock units and the non-employee director stock units. Compensation cost may also be capitalized. See Note 15 - Stock-based Compensation for additional information.\nEquity Investment in Unconsolidated Entities (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nThe equity method of accounting is used for equity investments where either AEP or SWEPCo exercise significant influence but do not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are initially recorded at cost in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets. The proportionate share of the investee\u2019s equity earnings or losses is included in Equity Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on the statements of income. AEP and SWEPCo regularly monitor and evaluate equity method investments to determine whether they are impaired. An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary in nature.\nAEP has various significant equity method investments, which include ETT, DHLC and five wind farms acquired in the purchase of Sempra Renewables LLC. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information.\nEarnings Per Share (EPS) (Applies to AEP)\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted-average outstanding common shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock awards.\nThe following table presents AEP\u2019s basic and diluted EPS calculations included on the statements of income:\nEquity Units are potentially dilutive securities but were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as the dilutive stock price thresholds were not met. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information related to Equity Units.\nThere were no antidilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2019. There were 128 thousand antidilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nSupplementary Income Statement Information\nThe following tables provide the components of Depreciation and Amortization for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nSupplementary Cash Flow Information (Applies to AEP)\n2. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nDuring the FASB\u2019s standard-setting process and upon issuance of final standards, management reviews the new accounting literature to determine its relevance, if any, to the Registrants\u2019 business. There are no new standards expected to have a material impact on the Registrants\u2019 financial statements.\n3. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except for AEPTCo. AEPTCo does not have any components of other comprehensive income for any period presented in the financial statements.\nPresentation of Comprehensive Income\nThe following tables provide the components of changes in AOCI and details of reclassifications from AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The amortization of pension and OPEB AOCI components are included in the computation of net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 8 - Benefit Plans for additional information.\nOPCo\nPSO\n(a)The change in fair value includes $(7) million, $6 million and $4 million related to AEP's investment in joint venture wind farms acquired as part of the purchase of Sempra Renewables LLC for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See \u201cSempra Renewables LLC\u201d section of Note 17 for additional information.\n(b)Amounts reclassified to the referenced line item on the statements of income.\n4. RATE MATTERS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants are involved in rate and regulatory proceedings at the FERC and their state commissions. Rate matters can have a material impact on net income, cash flows and possibly financial condition. The Registrants\u2019 recent significant rate orders and pending rate filings are addressed in this note.\nAEP Texas Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAEP Texas Interim Transmission and Distribution Rates\nThrough December 31, 2021, AEP Texas\u2019 cumulative revenues from interim base rate increases that are subject to review is approximately $298 million. A base rate review could result in a refund to customers if AEP Texas incurs a disallowance of the transmission or distribution investment on which an interim increase was based. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission and distribution rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. AEP Texas is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than April 5, 2024.\nAPCo and WPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and APCo)\n2017-2019 Virginia Triennial Review\nIn November 2020, the Virginia SCC issued an order on APCo\u2019s 2017-2019 Triennial Review filing concluding that APCo earned above its authorized ROE but within its ROE band for the 2017-2019 period, resulting in no refund to customers and no change to APCo base rates on a prospective basis. The Virginia SCC approved a prospective 9.2% ROE for APCo's 2020-2022 triennial review period with the continuation of a 140 basis point band (8.5% bottom, 9.2% midpoint, 9.9% top).\nIn December 2020, an intervenor filed a petition at the Virginia SCC requesting reconsideration of: (a) the failure of the Virginia SCC to apply a threshold earnings test to the approved regulatory asset for APCo\u2019s closed coal-fired generation assets, (b) the Virginia SCC\u2019s use of a 2011 benchmark study to measure the replacement value of capacity for purposes of APCo\u2019s 2017 - 2019 earnings test and (c) the reasonableness and prudency of APCo\u2019s investments in AMI meters.\nIn December 2020, APCo filed a petition at the Virginia SCC requesting reconsideration of: (a) certain issues related to APCo\u2019s going-forward rates and (b) the Virginia SCC\u2019s decision to deny APCo tariff changes that align rates with underlying costs. For APCo\u2019s going-forward rates, APCo requested that the Virginia SCC clarify its final order and clarify whether APCo\u2019s current rates will allow it to earn a fair return. If the Virginia SCC\u2019s order did conclude on APCo\u2019s ability to earn a fair return through existing base rates, APCo further requested that the Virginia SCC clarify whether it has the authority to also permit an increase in base rates.\nIn March 2021, an intervenor filed its assignments of error with the Virginia Supreme Court related to the appeal of the November 2020 order in which it stated the Virginia SCC erred: (a) in determining that Virginia law did not apply to its determination to permit amortization for recovery of costs associated with retired coal-fired generation assets, (b) in establishing a new regulatory asset for a cost incurred outside of the triennial review period due to its failure to apply a threshold earnings test before approving deferred cost recovery and (c) in misapplying the requirement that APCo bear the burden of demonstrating that power purchases made by APCo from its affiliate, OVEC, were priced at the lower of OVEC\u2019s cost or the market price for nonaffiliated power.\nIn March 2021, APCo filed its assignments of error with the Virginia Supreme Court related to its appeal of the November 2020 order in which it stated the Virginia SCC erred: (a) in finding that costs associated with asset impairments related to early retirement determinations made by APCo for certain generation facilities should not be attributed to the test periods under review and deemed fully recovered in the period recorded, (b) in finding that it was permitted to evaluate the reasonableness of APCo\u2019s decision to record, per books for financial reporting purposes, asset impairments related to early retirement determinations for certain generation facilities, (c) as a result of the errors described in (a) and (b), in denying APCo an increase in rates, (d) in failing to review and make any findings regarding whether APCo\u2019s rates would allow it to earn a fair rate of return going forward, (e) in denying APCo an increase in base rates by failing to ensure that APCo has an opportunity to recover its costs and earn a fair rate of return, thereby resulting in a taking of private property for public use without just compensation and (f) in retroactively adjusting APCo\u2019s depreciation expense for purposes of calculating APCo\u2019s earnings for the 2017-2019 triennial period.\nIn March 2021, the Virginia SCC issued an order confirming certain of its decisions from the November 2020 order and rejecting the various requests for reconsideration from APCo and an intervenor. In confirming its decision to reject an intervenor\u2019s recommendation that APCo\u2019s AMI costs incurred during the triennial period be disallowed, the Virginia SCC clarified that APCo established the need to replace its existing AMR meters, and that based on the uncertainty surrounding the continued manufacturing and support of AMR technology, APCo reasonably chose to replace them with AMI meters. In March 2021, APCo filed a notice of appeal of the reconsideration order with the Virginia Supreme Court. In September 2021, APCo submitted its brief before the Virginia Supreme Court. The brief was in alignment with the assignments of error filed by APCo in March 2021. In October 2021, the Virginia SCC and additional intervenors filed briefs with the Virginia Supreme Court disagreeing with APCo\u2019s assignments of error in its appeal of the Triennial Review decision. Additionally, the Virginia SCC and APCo filed briefs disagreeing with an intervenor\u2019s assignments of error in a separate appeal of the same decision. Oral arguments are scheduled to be held at the Virginia Supreme Court in March 2022.\nAPCo ultimately seeks an increase in base rates through its appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court. Among other issues, this appeal includes APCo\u2019s request for proper treatment of the closed coal-fired plant assets in APCo\u2019s 2017-2019 triennial period, reducing APCo\u2019s earnings below the bottom of its authorized ROE band. If APCo\u2019s appeals regarding treatment of the closed coal plants are granted by the Virginia Supreme Court, it could initially reduce future net income and impact financial condition. A Virginia Supreme Court decision in favor of APCo\u2019s original expensing of the closed coal-fired plant asset balances would likely result in a remand to the Virginia SCC. Upon a subsequent Virginia SCC order, the initial negative impact for the write-off of the closed coal-fired plant asset balances could potentially be offset by an increase in base rates for earning below APCo\u2019s 2017-2019 authorized ROE band.\nCCR/ELG Compliance Plan Filings\nIn December 2020, APCo submitted filings with the Virginia SCC and WVPSC requesting approvals necessary to implement CCR/ELG compliance plans at the Amos and Mountaineer Plants. Intervenors in Virginia and West Virginia recommended that only the CCR-related investments be constructed at Amos and Mountaineer and, as a consequence, that APCo close these generating facilities at the end of 2028.\nIn August 2021, the Virginia SCC issued an order approving APCo\u2019s request to construct CCR-related investments at the Amos and Mountaineer Plants and approved recovery of CCR-related other operation and maintenance expenses and investments through an active rider. The order denied APCo\u2019s request to construct the ELG investments and denied recovery of previously incurred ELG costs. APCo plans to refile for approval of the ELG investments and previously incurred ELG costs in the first quarter of 2022.\nAlso in August 2021, the WVPSC approved the request to construct CCR/ELG investments at the Amos and Mountaineer Plants and approved recovery of the West Virginia jurisdictional share of these costs through an active rider. In October 2021, due to the Virginia SCC previously rejecting the ELG investments, the WVPSC issued an order directing APCo to proceed with CCR/ELG compliance plans that would allow the plants to continue operating beyond 2028. The October order further states that APCo will not share capacity and energy from the plants with\ncustomers from Virginia if those customers are not paying for ELG compliance costs, or for any new capital investment or continuing operations costs incurred, to allow the plants to operate beyond 2028 or prevent downgrades prior to 2028. The WVPSC also ordered that APCo will be given the opportunity to recover, from West Virginia customers, the new capital and operating costs arising solely from the WVPSC's directive to operate the plants beyond 2028 if the WVPSC finds that the costs are reasonably and prudently incurred. In October and November 2021, intervenors filed petitions for reconsideration at the WVPSC requesting clarification on certain aspects of the order, primarily the jurisdictional allocation of future operating expenses and plant costs.\nAPCo expects total Amos and Mountaineer Plant ELG investment, excluding AFUDC, to be approximately $197 million. As of December 31, 2021, APCo\u2019s Virginia jurisdictional share of the net book value, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory, of the Amos and Mountaineer Plants was approximately $1.5 billion and APCo\u2019s Virginia jurisdictional share of its ELG investment balance in CWIP for these plants was $26 million.\nIf any of the ELG costs are not approved for recovery and/or the retirement dates of the Amos and Mountaineer plants are accelerated to 2028 without commensurate cost recovery, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nETT Rate Matters (Applies to AEP)\nETT Interim Transmission Rates\nAEP has a 50% equity ownership interest in ETT. Predominantly all of ETT\u2019s revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next base rate proceeding. Through December 31, 2021, AEP\u2019s share of ETT\u2019s cumulative revenues that are subject to review is approximately $1.4 billion. A base rate review could produce a refund if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim increase was based. A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. ETT is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than February 1, 2023, during which the $1.4 billion of cumulative revenues above will be subject to review.\nI&M Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and I&M)\n2021 Indiana Base Rate Case\nIn July 2021, I&M filed a request with the IURC for a $104 million annual increase in Indiana rates, inclusive of base rates and riders, based upon a proposed 10% ROE. I&M proposed a phased-in annual increase in rates of $73 million effective in May 2022 with the remaining $31 million annual increase in rates to be effective January 2023. The proposed annual increase includes $7 million related to an annual increase in depreciation expense, driven by increased depreciation rates and proposed investments. The request also includes a new AMI rider for proposed meter projects.\nIn November 2021, I&M and intervenors filed an unopposed joint settlement agreement with the IURC. After adjustments to remove the impact of Rockport Plant, Unit 2, the agreement includes a $61 million annual revenue increase based on a 9.7% ROE. The primary differences between I&M\u2019s requested annual rate increase and the agreed upon settlement increase are primarily due to: (a) changes to the capital structure of I&M, (b) decreased depreciation rates and (c) certain changes to I&M\u2019s proposed rate base. Rockport Plant, Unit 2 costs will be recovered through riders until the lease expiration in December 2022. Adjustments to remove Rockport Plant, Unit 2 costs from base rates are consistent with the IURC\u2019s order approving I&M\u2019s proposed purchase of Rockport Plant, Unit 2. See \u201cRockport Plant Litigation\u201d section of Note 6 for additional information. In February 2022, the IURC issued an order approving the joint settlement agreement with no modifications. The IURC\u2019s order resulted in a phased-in increase in Indiana rates with a $3 million annual increase effective February 2022 and the remaining $58 million annual increase effective in January 2023.\nKPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP)\nCCR/ELG Compliance Plan Filings\nKPCo and WPCo each own a 50% interest in the Mitchell Plant. In December 2020 and February 2021, WPCo and KPCo filed requests with the WVPSC and KPSC, respectively, to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to implement CCR and ELG compliance plans and seek recovery of the estimated $132 million investment for the Mitchell Plant that would allow the plant to continue operating beyond 2028. Within those requests, WPCo and KPCo also filed a $25 million alternative to implement only the CCR-related investments with the WVPSC and KPSC, respectively, which would allow the Mitchell Plant to continue operating only through 2028.\nIn July 2021, the KPSC issued an order approving the CCR only alternative and rejecting the full CCR and ELG compliance plan. In August 2021, the WVPSC approved the full CCR and ELG compliance plan for the WPCo share of the Mitchell Plant. In September 2021, WPCo submitted a filing with the WVPSC to reopen the CCR/ELG case that was approved by the WVPSC in August 2021. Due to the rejection by the KPSC of the KPCo share of the ELG investments, WPCo requested the WVPSC consider approving the construction and recovery of all ELG costs at the plant. In October 2021, the WVPSC affirmed its August 2021 order approving the construction of CCR/ELG investments and directed WPCo to proceed with CCR/ELG compliance plans that would allow the plant to continue operating beyond 2028. The WVPSC\u2019s order further states WPCo will not share capacity and energy from the plant with KPCo customers if those customers are not paying for ELG compliance costs, or for any new capital investment or continuing operations costs incurred, to allow the plant to operate beyond 2028 or prevent downgrades prior to 2028. The WVPSC also ordered that WPCo will be given the opportunity to recover, from its customers, the new capital and operating costs arising solely from the WVPSC's directive to operate the plant beyond 2028 if the WVPSC finds that the costs are reasonably and prudently incurred. In October and November 2021, intervenors filed petitions for reconsideration at the WVPSC requesting clarification on certain aspects of the\norder, primarily the jurisdictional allocation of future operating expenses and plant costs.\nIn November 2021, AEP made filings with the KPSC, WVPSC and FERC seeking approval for a new proposed Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement and Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement between KPCo and WPCo pursuant to which WPCo would replace KPCo as the operator of the Mitchell Plant. In February 2022, AEP filed a motion to withdraw its filing with the FERC, noting that AEP intends to re-file its request after the KPSC and WVPSC reviews have been completed. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2021, KPCo\u2019s share of the Mitchell Plant\u2019s ELG investment balance in CWIP was $3 million. As of December 31, 2021, the net book value of KPCo\u2019s share of the Mitchell Plant, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory, was $586 million.\nIf any of the ELG costs are not approved for recovery and/or the retirement date of the Mitchell Plant is accelerated to 2028 without commensurate cost recovery, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nOPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\n2020 Ohio Base Rate Case\nIn June 2020, OPCo filed a request with the PUCO for a $42 million annual increase in base rates based upon a proposed 10.15% ROE net of existing riders.\nIn March 2021, OPCo, the PUCO staff and various intervenors filed a joint stipulation and settlement agreement with the PUCO. The agreement includes a $68 million annual decrease in base rates based on an ROE of 9.7%. The difference between OPCo\u2019s requested annual base rate increase and the agreed upon decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the requested ROE, the removal of proposed future energy efficiency costs and a decrease in vegetation management expenses moved to recovery in riders. Additionally, the agreement includes: (a) an\nincreased fixed monthly residential customer charge, (b) the discontinuation of rate decoupling and (c) the continuation of the DIR with annual revenue caps of $57 million in 2021, $91 million in 2022, $116 million in 2023 and $51 million for the first five months of 2024. Annual revenue caps for the DIR can be increased if OPCo achieves certain reliability standards. In November 2021, the PUCO approved the joint stipulation and settlement agreement and rates went into effect in December 2021.\nOVEC Cost Recovery Audits\nIn December 2021, as part of OVEC cost recovery audits pending before the PUCO, intervenors filed positions claiming that costs incurred by OPCo during the 2018-2019 audit period were imprudent and should be disallowed. Management disagrees with these claims and is unable to predict the impact, if any, these disputes may have on future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See \"OVEC\" section of Note 17 for additional information on AEP and OPCo\u2019s investment in OVEC.\nPSO Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and PSO)\n2021 Oklahoma Base Rate Case\nIn April 2021, PSO filed a request with the OCC for a $172 million net annual increase in Oklahoma base rates based upon a 10% ROE. The proposed net annual increase includes: (a) a $57 million annual depreciation expense increase, of which $45 million is related to the accelerated depreciation recovery of the Oklaunion Power Station and Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2026 and (b) $31 million related to increased SPP expenses. PSO also requested the continuation of its SPP Transmission Tariff that tracks transmission costs as well as continuation and expansion of its Distribution and Safety Reliability Rider to recover projects in its proposed grid transformation and revitalization plan, which includes $100 million annual capital spend over a 5 year period. In August 2021, PSO updated its request for a net annual revenue increase to appropriately reflect certain cost reductions and annualized rider revenues transitioning into base rates. PSO\u2019s updated request filed with the OCC is for a $128 million net annual increase in Oklahoma base rates based upon a 10% ROE.\nIn September 2021, PSO, OCC staff and certain intervenors filed a contested joint stipulation and settlement agreement with the OCC that included a net annual revenue increase of $51 million based upon a 9.4% ROE. The agreement also included: (a) recovery of, with a debt return on, the Oklaunion Power Station regulatory asset through 2046 and continued recovery of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2040, (b) updated depreciation rates for plant in service, excluding coal production plant, (c) approval to defer a weighted average cost of capital carrying charge on PSO\u2019s deferred tax asset associated with net operating loss on a stand-alone tax basis beginning in November 2021 and, contingent upon receipt of a supportive private letter ruling from the IRS, approval to collect the deferral through a rider over a 20-month period, (d) modification of the SPP transmission tariff to reduce the scope of tracked transmission expense and (e) modification of the Distribution Reliability and Safety Rider to limit recovery to previously approved projects not in service as of June 2021. PSO implemented an interim annual base rate increase of $51 million starting with the November 2021 billing cycle. In December 2021, the OCC approved the joint stipulation and settlement agreement without modifications. Effective February 2022, interim rates were terminated and updated rates and tariffs went into effect in accordance with the final order.\nFebruary 2021 Severe Winter Weather Impacts in SPP\nIn February 2021, severe winter weather had a significant impact in SPP, resulting in the declaration of Energy Emergency Alert Levels 2 and 3 for the first time in SPP\u2019s history. The winter storm increased the demand for natural gas and restricted the available natural gas supply resulting in significantly increased market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. For the time period of February 9, 2021, to February 20, 2021, PSO\u2019s natural gas expenses and purchases of electricity still to be recovered from customers are $679 million as of December 31, 2021.\nIn April 2021, the OCC approved a waiver for PSO allowing the deferral of the extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity, including a carrying charge at an interim rate of 0.75%, over a longer time period than what the FAC traditionally allows. In January 2022, PSO, OCC staff and certain intervenors filed a joint stipulation and settlement agreement with the OCC to approve PSO\u2019s securitization of the extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity. The agreement includes a determination that all of PSO\u2019s extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity were prudent and reasonable and a 0.75% carrying charge, subject to true-up based on actual financing costs. In February 2022, the OCC approved the joint stipulation and settlement agreement in its financing order.\nSWEPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\n2012 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk Plant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant\u2019s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo\u2019s recovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs.\nUpon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant\u2019s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap. As a result, SWEPCo reversed $114 million of a previously recorded regulatory disallowance in 2013. In 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT\u2019s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the Texas Third Court of Appeals.\nIn July 2018, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the PUCT\u2019s judgment affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant and remanded the issue back to the PUCT. In January 2019, SWEPCo and the PUCT filed petitions for review with the Texas Supreme Court. In March 2021, the Texas Supreme Court issued an opinion reversing the July 2018 judgment of the Texas Third Court of Appeals and agreeing with the PUCT\u2019s judgment affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant. In addition, the Texas Supreme Court remanded the AFUDC dispute back to the Texas Third Court of Appeals. No parties filed a motion for rehearing with the Texas Supreme Court. In August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court judgement affirming the PUCT\u2019s order on AFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT\u2019s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap, and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. SWEPCo disagrees with the Court of Appeals decision and submitted a Petition for Review with the Texas Supreme Court in November 2021. The Texas Supreme Court requested responses to the Petition for Review, which are due by the end of March 2022.\nIf SWEPCo is ultimately unable to recover capitalized Turk Plant costs, including AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap, it would be expected to result in a pretax net disallowance ranging from $80 million to $100 million. In addition, if AFUDC is ultimately determined to be included in the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap, SWEPCo estimates it may be required to make customer refunds ranging from $0 to $160 million related to revenues collected from February 2013 through December 2021 and such determination may reduce SWEPCo\u2019s future revenues by approximately $15 million on an annual basis.\n2016 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2016, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $69 million based upon a 10% ROE. In January 2018, the PUCT issued a final order approving a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $50 million based upon a ROE of 9.6%, effective May 2017. The final order also included: (a) approval to recover the Texas jurisdictional share of environmental investments placed in- service, as of June 30, 2016, at various plants, including Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, (b) approval of recovery of, but no return on, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, (c) approval of $2 million in additional vegetation management expenses and (d) the rejection of SWEPCo\u2019s proposed transmission cost recovery mechanism.\nAs a result of the final order, in 2017 SWEPCo: (a) recorded an impairment charge of $19 million, which included $7 million associated with the lack of return on Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and $12 million related to other disallowed plant investments, (b) recognized $32 million of additional revenues, for the period of May 2017 through December 2017, that was surcharged to customers in 2018 and (c) recognized an additional $7 million of expenses consisting primarily of depreciation expense and vegetation management expense, offset by the deferral of rate case expense. SWEPCo implemented new rates in February 2018 billings. The $32 million of additional 2017 revenues was collected during 2018. In March 2018, the PUCT clarified and corrected portions of the final order, without changing the overall decision or amounts of the rate change. The order has been appealed by various intervenors. The appeal will move forward following the conclusion of the 2012 Texas Base Rate Case. If certain parts of the PUCT order are overturned, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2020 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn October 2020, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a $105 million annual increase in Texas base rates based upon a proposed 10.35% ROE. The request would move transmission and distribution interim revenues recovered through riders into base rates. Eliminating these riders would result in a net annual requested base rate increase of $90 million primarily due to increased investments. The proposed net annual increase: (a) includes $5 million related to vegetation management to maintain and improve the reliability of SWEPCo\u2019s Texas jurisdictional distribution system, (b) requests a $10 million annual depreciation increase and (c) seeks $2 million annually to establish a storm catastrophe reserve. In addition, SWEPCo also requested recovery of the Texas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station of $45 million which was retired in December 2021. SWEPCo subsequently filed a request with the PUCT lowering the requested annual increase in Texas base rates to $100 million which would result in an $85 million net annual base rate increase after moving the proposed riders to rate base.\nIn January 2022, the PUCT issued a final order approving an annual revenue increase of $39 million based upon a 9.25% ROE. The order also includes: (a) rates implemented retroactively back to March 18, 2021, (b) $5 million of the proposed increase related to vegetation management, (c) $2 million annually to establish a storm catastrophe reserve (d) the creation of a rider that would recover the Dolet Hills Power Station as if it were in rate base until its retirement at the end of 2021 and starting in 2022 the remaining net book value would be recovered as a regulatory asset through 2046. As a result of the final order, SWEPCo recorded a disallowance of $12 million associated with the lack of return on the Dolet Hills Power Station. In February 2022, SWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT challenging several errors in the order, which include challenges of the approved ROE, the denial of a reasonable return or carrying costs on the Dolet Hills Power Station and the calculation of the Texas jurisdictional share of the storm catastrophe reserve.\n2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case\nIn December 2020, SWEPCo filed a request with the LPSC for a $134 million annual increase in Louisiana base rates based upon a proposed 10.35% ROE. SWEPCo subsequently revised the requested annual increase to $114 million to reflect removing hurricane storm restoration costs from the base case filing. The hurricane costs have been requested in a separate storm filing. See \u201c2021 Louisiana Storm Cost Filing\u201d below for more information. The base case filing would extend the formula rate plan for five years and includes modifications to the formula rate plan to allow for forward-looking transmission costs, reflects the impact of net operating losses associated with the acceleration of certain tax benefits and incorporates future federal corporate income tax changes. The proposed net annual increase requests a $32 million annual depreciation increase to recover Louisiana\u2019s share of the Dolet Hills Power Station, Pirkey Power Plant and Welsh Plant, all of which are expected to be retired early.\nIn July 2021, the LPSC staff filed testimony supporting a $6 million annual increase in base rates based upon a ROE of 9.1% while other intervenors recommended a ROE ranging from 9.35% to 9.8%. The primary differences between SWEPCo\u2019s requested annual increase in base rates and the LPSC staff\u2019s recommendation include: (a) a reduction in depreciation expense, (b) recovery of Dolet Hills Power Station and Pirkey Power Plant in a separate rider mechanism, (c) the rejection of SWEPCo\u2019s proposed adjustment to include a stand-alone net operating loss carryforward deferred tax asset in rate base and (d) a reduction in the proposed ROE.\nIn September 2021, SWEPCo filed rebuttal testimony supporting a revised requested annual increase in base rates of $95 million. The primary differences in the rebuttal testimony from the previous revised request of $114 million are modifications to the proposed recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station and revisions to various proposed amortizations. LPSC staff and intervenor responses to SWEPCo\u2019s rebuttal testimony were filed in October 2021. The procedural schedule for the case is on hold due to ongoing settlement discussions.\nIf any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case\nIn July 2021, SWEPCo filed a request with the APSC for an $85 million annual increase in Arkansas base rates based upon a proposed 10.35% ROE with a capital structure of 48.7% debt and 51.3% common equity. The proposed annual increase includes: (a) a $41 million revenue requirement for the North Central Wind Facilities, (b) a $14 million annual depreciation increase primarily due to recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2026 and Pirkey Plant and Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 through 2037 and (c) a $6 million increase due to SPP costs. SWEPCo requested that rates become effective in June 2022.\nAPSC staff filed testimony supporting a $47 million annual increase in base rates based upon a ROE of 9.3% while other intervenors recommended a ROE ranging from 8.75% to 9.25%. The primary differences between SWEPCo\u2019s requested annual increase in base rates and the APSC staff\u2019s recommendation include: (a) recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2046 with no debt or equity return, (b) a reduction in the proposed ROE with a capital structure of 55.5% debt and 44.5% common equity and (c) lower depreciation rates. The APSC staff also recommended future generating facility retirements be treated similar to the Dolet Hills Power Station recommendation of recovery with no debt or equity return. Also, an intervenor recommended no debt or equity return on the Pirkey Power Plant after its retirement, which is currently expected to be in 2023. SWEPCo filed rebuttal testimony in January 2022 revising the requested annual increase in Arkansas base rates to $81 million with rates to be effective in June 2022. A hearing will be held at the APSC in March 2022. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2021 Louisiana Storm Cost Filing\nIn 2020, Hurricanes Laura and Delta caused power outages and extensive damage to the SWEPCo service territories, primarily impacting the Louisiana jurisdiction. Following both hurricanes, the LPSC issued orders allowing Louisiana utilities, including SWEPCo, to establish regulatory assets to track and defer expenses associated with these storms. In February 2021, severe winter weather impacted the Louisiana jurisdiction and in March 2021, the LPSC approved the deferral of incremental storm restoration expenses related to the winter storm. In October 2021, SWEPCo filed a request with the LPSC for recovery of $145 million in deferred storm costs associated with the three storms. As part of the filing, SWEPCo requested recovery of the carrying charges on the deferred regulatory asset at a weighted average cost of capital through a rider beginning in January 2022. LPSC staff testimony is due to the LPSC in May 2022 and an order is expected before the end of 2022. If any of the storm costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nFebruary 2021 Severe Winter Weather Impacts in SPP\nAs discussed in the \u201cPSO Rate Matters\u201d section above, severe winter weather had a significant impact in SPP, resulting in significantly increased market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. For the time period of February 9, 2021, to February 20, 2021, SWEPCo\u2019s natural gas expenses and purchases of electricity still to be recovered from customers are $430 million as of December 31, 2021, of which $103 million, $148 million and $179 million is related to the Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas jurisdictions, respectively.\nIn March 2021, the APSC issued an order authorizing recovery of the Arkansas jurisdictional share of the retail customer fuel costs over five years, with the appropriate carrying charge to be determined at a later date. Subsequently, SWEPCo began recovery of these fuel costs. SWEPCo is currently recovering the fuel costs at an interim carrying charge of 0.3%. In April 2021, SWEPCo filed testimony supporting a five-year recovery with a carrying charge of 6.05%, which has been supported by APSC staff. Various other parties have recommended recovery periods ranging from 5-20 years with a carrying charge of 1.65%. The APSC ordered more testimony regarding the option of utilizing securitization to recover the fuel costs. SWEPCo is awaiting a decision from the APSC. The prudence of these fuel costs is expected to be addressed in a separate proceeding.\nIn March 2021, the LPSC approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the FAC and shortly after SWEPCo began recovery of its Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs based on a five-year recovery period inclusive of an interim carrying charge of 3.25%. SWEPCo will work with the LPSC to finalize the actual recovery period and determine the appropriate carrying charge in future proceedings.\nIn August 2021, SWEPCo filed an application with the PUCT to implement a net interim fuel surcharge for the Texas jurisdictional share of these retail fuel costs. The application requested a five-year recovery with a carrying charge of 7.18%. In October 2021, various intervenors filed testimony supporting a five-year recovery with a carrying charge ranging from 0.82% to 1.625%. In January 2022, an ALJ issued a PFD recommending a four-year recovery with a carrying charge the same as the annually set interest rate used for under-recovered fuel. In February 2022, SWEPCo filed exceptions to the PFD, disagreeing with the short-term interest rate recommended by the ALJ. SWEPCo is awaiting an order from the PUCT.\nIf SWEPCo is unable to recover any of the costs relating to the extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity, or obtain authorization of a reasonable carrying charge on these costs, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nFERC Rate Matters\nFERC SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, PSO and SWEPCo)\nIn May 2021, certain joint customers submitted a formal challenge at the FERC related to the 2020 Annual Update of the 2019 SPP Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within SPP. Management has reviewed the formal challenge and responses were filed with the FERC in 2021. If the FERC orders revenue refunds or reductions, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nIndependence Energy Connection Project (Applies to AEP)\nIn 2016, PJM approved the Independence Energy Connection Project (IEC) and included it in its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan to alleviate congestion. Transource Energy owns the IEC, which is located in Maryland and Pennsylvania. In June 2020, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct the portion of the IEC in Maryland. In May 2021, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PA PUC) denied the IEC certificate for siting and construction of the portion in Pennsylvania. Transource Energy has appealed the PA PUC ruling in Pennsylvania state court and challenged the ruling before the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The case before the state court is pending and the case before the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania is currently suspended, pending the outcome of the case in the Pennsylvania state court.\nIn September 2021, PJM notified Transource Energy that the IEC was suspended to allow for the regulatory and related appeals process to proceed in an orderly manner without breaching milestone dates in the project agreement. PJM stated that the IEC has not been cancelled and remains necessary to alleviate congestion. As of December 31, 2021, AEP\u2019s share of IEC capital expenditures was approximately $81 million. The FERC has previously granted abandonment benefits for this project, allowing the full recovery of prudently incurred costs if the project is cancelled for reasons outside the control of Transource Energy. If any of the IEC costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n5. EFFECTS OF REGULATION\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nCoal-Fired Generation Plants (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo)\nCompliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal costs and permits. Management continuously evaluates cost estimates of complying with these regulations which has resulted in, and in the future may result in, a decision to retire coal-fired generating facilities earlier than their currently estimated useful lives.\nManagement is seeking or will seek regulatory recovery, as necessary, for any net book value remaining when the plants are retired. To the extent the net book value of these generation assets are not deemed recoverable, it could materially reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRegulated Generating Units that have been Retired\nPSO\nThe Oklaunion Power Station was retired in September 2020 and sold to a nonaffiliated third-party in October 2020. As part of the 2021 Oklahoma Base Rate Case, PSO received approval from the OCC to recover the Oklaunion Power Station as a regulatory asset through 2046. See \u201c2021 Oklahoma Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\nSWEPCo\nIn April 2016, Welsh Plant, Unit 2 was retired. As part of the 2016 Texas Base Rate Case, the PUCT authorized recovery of SWEPCo\u2019s Texas jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, but denied SWEPCo the ability to earn a return on this investment resulting in a disallowance of $7 million in 2017. See \u201c2016 Texas Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information. As part of the 2019 Arkansas Base Rate Case, SWEPCo received approval from the APSC to recover the Arkansas jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant, Unit 2. In December 2020, SWEPCo filed a request with the LPSC to recover the Louisiana jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant, Unit 2. See \u201c2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information. As of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo has a regulatory asset for plant retirement costs pending approval recorded on its balance sheet of $35 million related to the Louisiana jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant, Unit 2.\nIn December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired. As part of the 2020 Texas Base Rate Case, the PUCT authorized recovery of SWEPCo\u2019s Texas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station, but denied SWEPCo the ability to earn a return on this investment resulting in a disallowance of $12 million in December 2021. SWEPCo has also requested recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station in the Arkansas and Louisiana jurisdictions through base rate cases. See \u201c2020 Texas Base Rate Case\u201d, \u201c2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case\u201d and \u201c2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case\u201d sections of Note 4 for additional information. The Dolet Hills Power Station is currently being recovered through 2026 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2046 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo has a regulatory asset for the Dolet Hills Power Station pending approval recorded on its balance sheet of $72 million related to the Arkansas and Louisiana jurisdictional shares.\nRegulated Generating Units to be Retired\nPSO\nIn 2014, PSO received final approval from the Federal EPA to close Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, in 2026. The plant was originally scheduled to close in 2040. As a result of the early retirement date, PSO revised the useful life of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, to the projected retirement date of 2026 and the incremental depreciation is being deferred as a regulatory asset. As part of the 2021 Oklahoma Base Rate Case, PSO will continue to recover Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2040. See \u201c2021 Oklahoma Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\nSWEPCo\nIn November 2020, management announced plans to retire Pirkey Power Plant in 2023 and that it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028. As a result of the announcement, SWEPCo began recording a regulatory asset for accelerated depreciation.\nThe table below summarizes the net book value including CWIP, before cost of removal and materials and supplies, as of December 31, 2021, of generating facilities planned for early retirement:\n(a)Represents the amount of annual depreciation that has been collected from customers over the prior 12-month period.\n(b)Includes Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, which was retired in 2016. Removal of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, will be performed with Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, after retirement.\n(c)Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2040.\n(d)Pirkey Power Plant is currently being recovered through 2025 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2045 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\n(e)Includes Welsh Plant, Unit 2, which was retired in 2016. Removal of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, will be performed with Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, after retirement.\n(f)Unit 1 is being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Unit 3 is being recovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\nDolet Hills Power Station and Related Fuel Operations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn 2020, management of SWEPCo and CLECO determined DHLC would not proceed developing additional Oxbow Lignite Company (Oxbow) mining areas for future lignite extraction and ceased extraction of lignite at the mine in May 2020. In April 2020, SWEPCo and CLECO jointly filed a notification letter to the LPSC providing notice of the cessation of lignite mining. In December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired.\nThe Dolet Hills Power Station non-fuel costs are recoverable by SWEPCo through base rates. As of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo\u2019s share of the net investment in the Dolet Hills Power Station is $108 million, including materials and supplies, net of cost of removal collected in rates.\nFuel costs incurred by the Dolet Hills Power Station are recoverable by SWEPCo through active fuel clauses. As of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of $144 million, excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter weather event, which includes fuel consumed at the Dolet Hills Power Station. Additional reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by DHLC and Oxbow will be billed to SWEPCo and included in existing fuel clauses.\nIn June 2020, SWEPCo filed a fuel reconciliation with the PUCT for its retail operations in Texas, including Dolet Hills, for the reconciliation period of March 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019. See \u201c2020 Texas Fuel Reconciliation\u201d below for additional information.\nIn March 2021, the LPSC issued an order allowing SWEPCo to recover up to $20 million of fuel costs in 2021 and defer approximately $30 million of additional costs with a recovery period to be determined at a later date. In November 2021, the LPSC issued a directive which deferred the issues regarding modification of the level and timing of recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station from SWEPCo\u2019s pending rate case to a separate existing docket. In addition, the recovery of the deferred fuel costs are planned to be addressed.\nIn March 2021, the APSC approved fuel rates that provide recovery of the Arkansas share of the 2021 Dolet Hills Power Station fuel costs over five years through the existing fuel clause. In the Arkansas base case, Staff proposed an extension of the recovery period to 25 years. See \u201c2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\nIf any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nPirkey Power Plant and Related Fuel Operations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn 2020, management announced plans to retire the Pirkey Power Plant in 2023. The Pirkey Power Plant non-fuel costs are recoverable by SWEPCo through base rates and fuel costs are recovered through active fuel clauses. As of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo\u2019s share of the net investment in the Pirkey Power Plant is $207 million, including CWIP, before cost of removal. Sabine is a mining operator providing mining services to the Pirkey Power Plant. Under the provisions of the mining agreement, SWEPCo is required to pay, as part of the cost of lignite delivered, an amount equal to mining costs plus a management fee. SWEPCo expects fuel deliveries, including billings of all fixed and operating costs, from Sabine to cease during the first quarter of 2023. Under the fuel agreements, SWEPCo\u2019s fuel inventory and unbilled fuel costs from mining related activities were $91 million as of December 31, 2021. Also, as of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of $144 million, excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter weather event, which includes fuel consumed at the Pirkey Power Plant. Additional operational, reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by Sabine will be billed to SWEPCo and included in existing fuel clauses. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2020 Texas Fuel Reconciliation (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn June 2020, SWEPCo filed a fuel reconciliation with the PUCT for its retail operations in Texas for the reconciliation period of March 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019. The fuel reconciliation included total fuel costs of $1.7 billion ($616 million of which is related to the Texas jurisdiction). In January 2021, various parties filed testimony recommending fuel cost disallowances totaling $125 million relating to the Texas jurisdiction. Also in January 2021, SWEPCo filed rebuttal testimony disputing the recommended disallowances. In February 2021, SWEPCo and various parties reached a settlement in principle which resulted in a $10 million reduction in recoverable fuel costs for the reconciliation period, which was recognized in SWEPCo\u2019s 2020 financial statements. In November 2021, the settlement was approved by the PUCT.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nRegulatory assets and liabilities are comprised of the following items:\n(a)2021 amounts exclude $485 million of regulatory assets classified as Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n(b)Unrecovered Winter Storm Fuel Costs are pending final regulatory approval as of December 31, 2021. The current asset balance represents amounts expected to be recovered in the Arkansas and Louisiana jurisdictions over the next 12 months.

COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Registrants\u2019 business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Registrants cannot be predicted. Management accrues contingent liabilities only when management concludes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When management determines that it is not probable, but rather reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, management discloses such contingencies and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can be made. Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the maximum possible loss exposure. Circumstances change over time and actual results may vary significantly from estimates.\nFor current proceedings not specifically discussed below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial statements.\nCOMMITMENTS (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nThe AEP System has substantial commitments for fuel, energy and capacity contracts as part of the normal course of business. Certain contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cCommitments\u201d, the following tables summarize the Registrants\u2019 actual contractual commitments as of December 31, 2021:\nContractual Commitments - OPCo Less Than\n1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years After\n5 Years Total\n(in millions)\nEnergy and Capacity Purchase Contracts $ 34.6 $ 69.1 $ 65.4 $ 180.0 $ 349.1\n(a)Represents contractual commitments to purchase coal, natural gas, uranium and other consumables as fuel for electric generation along with related transportation of the fuel.\n(b)Includes $22 million of purchase fuel contracts for KPCo commitments that are expected to occur prior to the anticipated closing of the sale transaction in the second quarter of 2022. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n(c)In the first quarter of 2022, APCo entered into new fuel purchase contracts related to coal procurement. The new commitments were as follows: $95 million in less than 1 year, $449 million in 2-3 years and $96 million in 4-5 years. These commitments are not included in the tables above. All other new commitments in the first quarter of 2022 were immaterial.\nGUARANTEES\nLiabilities for guarantees are recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cGuarantees.\u201d There is no collateral held in relation to any guarantees. In the event any guarantee is drawn, there is no recourse to third-parties unless specified below.\nLetters of Credit (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nStandby letters of credit are entered into with third-parties. These letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs, security deposits and debt service reserves.\nAEP has $4 billion and $1 billion revolving credit facilities due in March 2026 and 2023, respectively, under which up to $1.2 billion may be issued as letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, no letters of credit were issued under the revolving credit facility.\nAn uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. AEP issues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under five uncommitted facilities totaling, as of December 31, 2021, $375 million. Subsequently, in February 2022, the uncommitted facilities total was increased to $400 million. The Registrants\u2019 maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nCompany Amount Maturity\n(in millions)\nAEP $ 168.5 January 2022 to December 2022\nAEP Texas 2.2 July 2022\nGuarantees of Equity Method Investees (Applies to AEP)\nIn 2019, AEP acquired Sempra Renewables LLC. The transaction resulted in the acquisition of a 50% ownership interest in five non-consolidated joint ventures and the acquisition of two tax equity partnerships. Parent has issued guarantees over the performance of the joint ventures. If a joint venture were to default on payments or\nperformance, Parent would be required to make payments on behalf of the joint venture. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees was $142 million, with the last guarantee expiring in December 2037. The non-contingent liability recorded associated with these guarantees was $28 million, with an additional $2 million expected credit loss liability for the contingent portion of the guarantees. Management considered historical losses, economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in the calculation of the expected credit loss. As the joint ventures generate cash flows through PPAs, the measurement of the contingent portion of the guarantee liability is based upon assessments of the credit quality and default probabilities of the respective PPA counterparties. See \u201cAcquisitions\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nIndemnifications and Other Guarantees\nContracts\nThe Registrants enter into certain types of contracts which require indemnifications. Typically these contracts include, but are not limited to, sale agreements, lease agreements, purchase agreements and financing agreements. Generally, these agreements may include, but are not limited to, indemnifications around certain tax, contractual and environmental matters. With respect to sale agreements, exposure generally does not exceed the sale price. As of December 31, 2021, there were no material liabilities recorded for any indemnifications.\nAEPSC conducts power purchase-and-sale activity on behalf of APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo, who are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted on their behalf. AEPSC also conducts power purchase-and-sale activity on behalf of PSO and SWEPCo, who are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted on their behalf.\nLease Obligations\nCertain Registrants lease equipment under master lease agreements. See \u201cMaster Lease Agreements\u201d and \u201cAEPRO Boat and Barge Leases\u201d sections of Note 13 for additional information.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES (Applies to All Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation\nBy-products from the generation of electricity include materials such as ash, slag, sludge, low-level radioactive waste and SNF. Coal combustion by-products, which constitute the overwhelming percentage of these materials, are typically treated and deposited in captive disposal facilities or are beneficially utilized. In addition, the generation plants and transmission and distribution facilities have used asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and other hazardous and non-hazardous materials. The Registrants currently incur costs to dispose of these substances safely.\nSuperfund addresses clean-up of hazardous substances that are released to the environment. The Federal EPA administers the clean-up programs. Several states enacted similar laws. As of December 31, 2021, APCo, OPCo and SWEPCo are named as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) for one, three and one sites, respectively, by the Federal EPA for which alleged liability is unresolved. There are 11 additional sites for which APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo and SWEPCo received information requests which could lead to PRP designation. I&M has also been named potentially liable at three sites under state law. In those instances where a PRP or defendant has been named, disposal or recycling activities were in accordance with the then-applicable laws and regulations. Superfund does not recognize compliance as a defense, but imposes strict liability on parties who fall within its broad statutory categories. Liability has been resolved for a number of sites with no significant effect on net income.\nManagement evaluates the potential liability for each Superfund site separately, but several general statements can be made about potential future liability. Allegations that materials were disposed at a particular site are often unsubstantiated and the quantity of materials deposited at a site can be small and often non-hazardous. Although Superfund liability has been interpreted by the courts as joint and several, typically many parties are named as PRPs for each site and several of the parties are financially sound enterprises. As of December 31, 2021, management\u2019s estimates do not anticipate material clean-up costs for identified Superfund sites.\nNUCLEAR CONTINGENCIES (APPLIES TO AEP AND I&M)\nI&M owns and operates the two-unit 2,296 MW Cook Plant under licenses granted by the NRC. I&M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and to safely decommission and decontaminate the plant. The licenses to operate the two nuclear units at the Cook Plant expire in 2034 and 2037. The operation of a nuclear facility also involves special risks, potential liabilities and specific regulatory and safety requirements. By agreement, I&M is partially liable, together with all other electric utility companies that own nuclear generation units, for a nuclear power plant incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S. Should a nuclear incident occur at any nuclear power plant in the U.S., the resultant liability could be substantial.\nDecommissioning and Low-Level Waste Accumulation Disposal\nThe costs to decommission a nuclear plant are affected by NRC regulations and the SNF disposal program. Decommissioning costs are accrued over the service life of Cook Plant. The most recent decommissioning cost study was performed in 2021. According to that study, the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste was $2.2 billion in 2021 non-discounted dollars, with additional ongoing costs of $7 million per year for post decommissioning storage of SNF and an eventual cost of $33 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the SNF storage facility, also in 2021 non-discounted dollars. I&M recovers estimated decommissioning costs for the Cook Plant in its rates. The amounts recovered in rates were $4 million, $4 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Decommissioning costs recovered from customers are deposited in external trusts.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total decommissioning trust fund balances were $3.5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. Trust fund earnings increase the fund assets and decrease the amount remaining to be recovered from customers. The decommissioning costs (including unrealized gains and losses, interest and trust funds expenses) increase or decrease the recorded liability.\nI&M continues to work with regulators and customers to recover the remaining estimated costs of decommissioning the Cook Plant. However, future net income and cash flows would be reduced and financial condition could be impacted if the cost of SNF disposal and decommissioning continues to increase and cannot be recovered.\nSpent Nuclear Fuel Disposal\nThe federal government is responsible for permanent SNF disposal and assesses fees to nuclear plant owners for SNF disposal. A fee of one-mill per KWh for fuel consumed after April 6, 1983 at the Cook Plant was collected from customers and remitted to the DOE through May 14, 2014. In May 2014, pursuant to court order from the U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the DOE adjusted the fee to $0. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, fees and related interest of $281 million and $281 million, respectively, for fuel consumed prior to April 7, 1983 were recorded as Long-term Debt and funds collected from customers along with related earnings totaling $329 million and $324 million, respectively, to pay the fee were recorded as part of Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on the balance sheets. I&M has not paid the government the pre-April 1983 fees due to continued delays and uncertainties related to the federal disposal program.\nIn 2011, I&M signed a settlement agreement with the federal government which permits I&M to make annual filings to recover certain SNF storage costs incurred as a result of the government\u2019s delay in accepting SNF for permanent storage. Under the settlement agreement, I&M received $14 million, $24 million and $8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to recover costs and will be eligible to receive additional payment of annual claims for allowed costs that are incurred through December 31, 2022. The proceeds reduced costs for dry cask storage. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, I&M deferred $3 million and $14 million, respectively, in Prepayments and Other Current Assets and $21 million and $1 million, respectively, in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets for dry cask storage and related operation and maintenance costs for recovery under this agreement. See \u201cFair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal\u201d section of Note 11 for additional information.\nNuclear Insurance\nI&M carries nuclear property insurance of $2.7 billion to cover a nuclear incident at Cook Plant including coverage for decontamination and stabilization, as well as premature decommissioning caused by a nuclear incident. Insurance coverage for a nonnuclear property incident at Cook Plant is $500 million. Additional insurance provides coverage for a weekly indemnity payment resulting from an insured accidental outage. I&M utilizes industry mutual insurers for the placement of this insurance coverage. Coverage from these industry mutual insurance programs require a contingent financial obligation of up to $42 million for I&M, which is assessable if the insurer\u2019s financial resources would be inadequate to pay for industry losses.\nThe Price-Anderson Act, extended through December 31, 2025, establishes insurance protection for public nuclear liability arising from a nuclear incident of $13.5 billion and applies to any incident at a licensed reactor in the U.S. Commercially available insurance, which must be carried for each licensed reactor, provides $450 million of primary coverage. In the event of a nuclear incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S., the remainder of the liability would be provided by a deferred premium assessment of $275 million per nuclear incident on Cook Plant\u2019s reactors payable in annual installments of $41 million. The number of incidents for which payments could be required is not limited.\nIn the event of an incident of a catastrophic nature, I&M is covered for public nuclear liability for the first $450 million through commercially available insurance. The next level of liability coverage of up to $13.1 billion would be covered by claim premium assessments made under the Price-Anderson Act. In the event nuclear losses or liabilities are underinsured or exceed accumulated funds, I&M would seek recovery of those amounts from customers through a rate increase. If recovery from customers is not possible, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nOPERATIONAL CONTINGENCIES\nInsurance and Potential Losses\nThe Registrants maintain insurance coverage normal and customary for electric utilities, subject to various deductibles. The Registrants also maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third-party injuries caused by cyber security incidents. Insurance coverage includes all risks of physical loss or damage to nonnuclear assets, subject to insurance policy conditions and exclusions. Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities and inventories. Excluded property generally includes transmission and distribution lines, poles and towers. The insurance programs also generally provide coverage against loss arising from certain claims made by third-parties and are in excess of retentions absorbed by the Registrants. Coverage is generally provided by a combination of the protected cell of EIS and/or various industry mutual and/or commercial insurance carriers. See \u201cNuclear Contingencies\u201d section above for additional information.\nSome potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities relating to a cyber security incident or damage to the Cook Plant and costs of replacement power in the event of an incident at the Cook Plant. Future losses or liabilities, if they occur, which are not completely insured, unless recovered from customers, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRockport Plant Litigation (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nIn 2013, the Wilmington Trust Company filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AEGCo and I&M alleging that it would be unlawfully burdened by the terms of the modified NSR consent decree after the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease expiration in December 2022. The terms of the consent decree allow the installation of environmental emission control equipment, repowering, refueling or retirement of the unit. The plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that the defendants breached the lease, must satisfy obligations related to installation of emission control equipment and indemnify the plaintiffs.\nAfter the litigation proceeded at the district court and appellate court, in April 2021, I&M and AEGCo reached an agreement to acquire 100% of the interests in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 for $116 million from certain financial institutions that own the unit through trusts established by Wilmington Trust, the nonaffiliated owner trustee of the ownership interests in the unit, with closing to occur as of the end of the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease in December 2022. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and as of the closing will result in a final settlement of, and release of claims in, the lease litigation. As a result, in May 2021, at the parties\u2019 request, the district court entered a stipulation and order dismissing the case without prejudice to plaintiffs asserting their claims in a re-filed action or a new action. The required regulatory approvals at the IURC and FERC have been obtained that would allow the closing to occur as of the end of the lease in December 2022. The IURC order approved a settlement agreement addressing the future use of Rockport Plant, Unit 2 as a capacity and energy resource and associated adjustments to I&M\u2019s Indiana retail rates, along with certain other matters. Management believes its financial statements appropriately reflect the resolution of the litigation. See \u201cRockport Lease section of Note 13 for additional information.\nClaims Challenging Transition of American Electric Power System Retirement Plan to Cash Balance Formula\nFour participants in The American Electric Power System Retirement Plan (the Plan) filed a class action complaint in December 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against AEPSC and the Plan. When the Plan\u2019s benefit formula was changed in the year 2000, AEP provided a special provision for employees hired before January 1, 2001, allowing them to continue benefit accruals under the then benefit formula for a full 10 years alongside of the new cash balance benefit formula then being implemented. Employees who were hired on or after January 1, 2001 accrued benefits only under the new cash balance benefit formula. The Plaintiffs assert a number of claims on behalf of themselves and the purported class, including that: (a) the Plan violates the requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) intended to preclude back-loading the accrual of benefits to the end of a participant\u2019s career, (b) the Plan violates the age discrimination prohibitions of ERISA and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and (c) AEP failed to provide required notice regarding the changes to the Plan. Among other relief, the Complaint seeks reformation of the Plan to provide additional benefits and the recovery of plan benefits for former employees under such reformed plan. The Plaintiffs previously had submitted claims for additional plan benefits to AEP, which were denied. On February 15, 2022, AEPSC and the Plan filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. AEP will continue to defend against the claims. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6) (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts and OVEC\u2019s coal-fired generating units. OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. After AEP learned of the criminal allegations against the Ohio legislator and others relating to HB 6, AEP, with assistance from outside advisors, conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the passage of the bill. Management does not believe that AEP was involved in any wrongful conduct in connection with the passage of HB 6.\nIn August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws. The amended complaint alleged misrepresentations or omissions by AEP regarding: (a) its alleged participation in or connection to public corruption with respect to the passage of HB 6 and (b) its regulatory, legislative, political contribution, 501(c)(4) organization contribution and lobbying activities in Ohio. The complaint sought monetary damages, among other forms of relief. In December 2021, the District Court issued an opinion and order dismissing the securities litigation complaint with prejudice, determining that the complaint fails to plead any actionable misrepresentations or omissions. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling.\nIn January 2021, an AEP shareholder filed a derivative action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio purporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In February 2021, a second AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. In April 2021, a third AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and a fourth AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Nassau County. These derivative complaints allege the officers and directors made misrepresentations and omissions similar to those alleged in the putative securities class action lawsuit filed against AEP. The derivative complaints together assert claims for: (a) breach of fiduciary duty, (b) waste of corporate assets, (c) unjust enrichment, (d) breach of duty for insider trading and (e) contribution for violations of sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and seek monetary damages and changes to AEP\u2019s corporate governance and internal policies among other forms of relief. The New York state court derivative action is stayed. The Ohio state court derivative action was stayed until February 18, 2022, and the parties to that case filed a stipulation seeking to extend the stay. The two derivative actions pending in federal court have been consolidated, and the parties to the consolidated action have filed a joint motion for the court to enter a scheduling order pursuant to which plaintiffs will file an amended complaint and the parties will then propose a briefing schedule for defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The defendants will continue to defend\nagainst the claims. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn March 2021, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing a purported AEP shareholder. The litigation demand letter is directed to the Board of Directors of AEP and contains factual allegations involving HB 6 that are generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The letter demands, among other things, that the AEP Board undertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations by directors and officers, and that, following such investigation, AEP commence a civil action for breaches of fiduciary duty and related claims and take appropriate disciplinary action against those individuals who allegedly harmed the company. The shareholder that sent the letter has agreed that AEP and the AEP Board may defer consideration of the litigation demand until the resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities litigation. The AEP Board will act in response to the letter as appropriate. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn May 2021, AEP received a subpoena from the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement seeking various documents, including documents relating to the benefits to AEP from the passage of HB 6 and documents relating to AEP\u2019s financial processes and controls. AEP is cooperating fully with the SEC\u2019s subpoena. Although the outcome of the SEC\u2019s investigation cannot be predicted, management does not believe the results of this inquiry will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n7. ACQUISITIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE, DISPOSITIONS, AND IMPAIRMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP unless indicated otherwise.\nACQUISITIONS\nDry Lake Solar Project (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn November 2020, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement with a nonaffiliate to acquire a 75% ownership interest in the entity that owns the 100 MW Dry Lake Solar Project (collectively referred to as Dry Lake) located in southern Nevada for approximately $114 million. In March 2021, AEP closed the transaction and the solar project was placed in-service in May 2021. Approximately $103 million of the purchase price was paid upon closing of the transaction and the remaining $11 million was paid when the project was placed in-service. In accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d management determined that the acquisition of Dry Lake represents an asset acquisition. Additionally, and in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cConsolidation,\u201d management concluded that Dry Lake is a VIE and that AEP is the primary beneficiary based on its power as managing member to direct the activities that most significantly impact Dry Lake\u2019s economic performance. As the primary beneficiary of Dry Lake, AEP consolidates Dry Lake into its financial statements. As a result, to account for the initial consolidation of Dry Lake, management applied the acquisition method by allocating the purchase price based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and noncontrolling interest assumed. The fair value of the primary assets acquired and the noncontrolling interest assumed was determined using the market approach. The key input assumptions were the transaction price paid for AEP\u2019s interest in Dry Lake and recent third-party market transactions for similar solar generation facilities. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information.\nNorth Central Wind Energy Facilities (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo)\nIn 2020, PSO and SWEPCo received regulatory approvals to acquire the NCWF, comprised of three Oklahoma wind facilities totaling 1,484 MWs, on a fixed cost turn-key basis at completion. PSO and SWEPCo will own undivided interests of 45.5% and 54.5% of the NCWF, respectively. In total, the three wind facilities will cost approximately $2 billion and consist of Traverse (998 MW), Maverick (287 MW) and Sundance (199 MW). Output from the NCWF will serve retail load in PSO\u2019s Oklahoma service territory and both retail and FERC wholesale load in SWEPCo\u2019s service territories in Arkansas and Louisiana. The Oklahoma and Louisiana portions of the NCWF revenue requirement, net of PTC benefit, are recoverable through authorized riders beginning at commercial operation and until such time as amounts are reflected in base rates. Recovery of the Arkansas portion of the NCWF revenue requirement is requested in SWEPCo\u2019s pending 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case. The NCWF are subject to various regulatory performance requirements. If these performance requirements are not met, PSO and SWEPCo would recognize a regulatory liability to refund retail customers. As of December 31, 2021 PSO and SWEPCo have not incurred a material regulatory liability related to performance requirements for NCWF.\nIn April 2021, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Sundance during its development and construction for $270 million, the first of the three NCWF acquisitions. Immediately following the acquisition, PSO and SWEPCo liquidated the entity and simultaneously distributed the Sundance assets in proportion to their undivided ownership interests. Sundance was placed in-service in April 2021.\nIn September 2021, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Maverick during its development and construction for $383 million, the second of the three NCWF acquisitions. Immediately following the acquisition, PSO and SWEPCo liquidated the entity and simultaneously distributed the\nMaverick assets in proportion to their undivided ownership interests. Maverick was placed in-service in September 2021.\nIn accordance with the guidance for \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d management determined that the acquisitions of Sundance and Maverick represent asset acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, PSO and SWEPCo had approximately $316 million and $378 million, of gross Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets, respectively, related to the Sundance and Maverick NCWF projects. On an ongoing basis, management further determined that PSO and SWEPCo should apply the joint plant accounting model to account for their respective undivided interests in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Sundance and Maverick.\nThe Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) includes collective interests in numerous land contracts, as originally executed between the nonaffiliated party and the respective owners of the properties as defined in the contracts. These contracts provide for easement and access rights to the land that Sundance and Maverick were built upon. These interests as lessee in each of the land contracts were transferred to Sundance and Maverick (and subsequently to PSO and SWEPCo) as a part of the closing of the PSA. As of December 31, 2021, the Noncurrent Obligations Under Operating Leases for Sundance are $13 million and $15 million on the balance sheets for PSO and SWEPCo, respectively, and the Noncurrent Obligations Under Operating Leases for Maverick are $18 million and $22 million on the balance sheets for PSO and SWEPCo, respectively.\nDesert Sky Wind Farm and Trent Wind Farm (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn August 2020, AEP exercised its call right which required the nonaffiliated member of Desert Sky Wind Farm LLC and Trent Wind Farm LLC (collectively the LLCs) to sell its noncontrolling interest to AEP. The exercise price for the call right was determined using a discounted cash flow model with agreed input assumptions as well as updates to certain assumptions reasonably expected based on the actual results of the LLCs. As a result, the LLCs are wholly-owned by AEP and management has concluded that the LLCs are no longer VIEs. AEP paid $57 million in cash, derecognized $63 million of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest within Mezzanine Equity and recorded an increase of $6 million of Paid-In Capital on the balance sheets. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information.\nSanta Rita East (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn November 2020, AEP acquired an additional 10% interest in Santa Rita East for approximately $44 million resulting in AEP having a total interest of 85%. The acquisition of the incremental ownership interest was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with the accounting guidance for \"Consolidation\" and reduced Noncontrolling Interests on the balance sheets by approximately $44 million. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information.\nSempra Renewables LLC (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn April 2019, AEP acquired Sempra Renewables LLC and its ownership interests in 724 MWs of wind generation and battery assets valued at approximately $1.1 billion. This acquisition is part of AEP\u2019s strategy to grow its renewable generation portfolio and to diversify generation resources. AEP paid $580 million in cash and acquired a 50% ownership interest in five non-consolidated joint ventures with net assets valued at $404 million as of the acquisition date (which includes $364 million of existing debt obligations). Additionally, the transaction included the acquisition of two tax equity partnerships and the associated recognition of noncontrolling tax equity interest of $135 million.\nManagement allocated the purchase price based upon the fair value of the assets acquired and noncontrolling interests assumed. The fair value of the primary assets acquired and the noncontrolling interests assumed was determined using a discounted cash flow method under the income approach. The key input assumptions utilized in the determination of the fair value of these assets were the pricing and terms of the existing PPAs, forecasted market power prices, expected wind farm net capacity and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows and future power prices. Estimating forecasted market power prices involved determining the cost of constructing and operating a new wind plant over an assumed life in the same geographic region as of the acquisition date using third-party market participant assumptions. The expected wind farm net capacity was developed by evaluating each wind farm\u2019s historical and expected generation against historical generation of comparable wind farms in the same locations. Discount rates were evaluated by considering the cost of capital of comparable businesses. Additional key input assumptions for the fair value of the noncontrolling interests include the terms of the limited liability company agreements that dictate the sharing of the tax attributes and cash flows associated with the tax equity partnerships.\nUpon closing of the purchase, Sempra Renewables LLC was legally renamed AEP Wind Holdings LLC. AEP Wind Holdings LLC develops, owns and operates, or holds interests in wind generation facilities in the United States. The operating wind generation portfolio includes seven wind farms. Five wind farms are jointly-owned with BP Wind Energy, and two wind farms are consolidated by AEP and are tax equity partnerships with nonaffiliated noncontrolling interests. All seven wind farms have long-term PPAs for 100% of their energy production. The PPAs with I&M, OPCo and SWEPCo were executed prior to the acquisition of the wind farms and will be accounted for in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRelated Parties.\u201d See \u201cSempra Renewables LLC PPAs\u201d section of Note 16 for additional information.\nThe acquired business contributed revenues and net income to AEP that were not material for the period April 22, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The pro-forma revenue and net income related to the acquisition of Sempra Renewables LLC were not material for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSee Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information related to the purchased wind farms.\nSanta Rita East (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn July 2019, AEP acquired a 75% interest, or 227 MWs, in Santa Rita East for approximately $356 million. In accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d management determined that the acquisition of Santa Rita East represents an asset acquisition. Additionally, and in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cConsolidation,\u201d management concluded that Santa Rita East is a VIE. As a result, to account for the initial consolidation of Santa Rita East, management applied the acquisition method by allocating the purchase price based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and noncontrolling interest assumed. The fair value of the primary assets acquired and the noncontrolling interest assumed was determined using the market approach. The key input assumptions were the transaction price paid for AEP\u2019s interest in Santa Rita East and recent third-party market transactions for similar wind farms. See \u201cSanta Rita East\u201d section of Note 17 for additional information.\nASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE\nDisposition of KPCo and KTCo (Vertically Integrated Utilities and AEP Transmission Holdco Segments) (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)\nIn October 2021, AEP entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to sell KPCo and KTCo to Liberty Utilities Co., a subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (Liberty), for approximately a $2.85 billion enterprise value. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals from the FERC and KPSC. Clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has been received.\nKPCo currently operates and owns a 50% interest in the 1,560 MW coal-fired Mitchell Power Plant (Mitchell Plant) with the remaining 50% owned by WPCo. The Stock Purchase Agreement is further contingent upon the issuance by the KPSC, WVPSC and FERC of orders regarding a new proposed Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement and Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement between KPCo and WPCo pursuant to which WPCo would replace KPCo as the operator of the Mitchell Plant and KPCo employees at the Mitchell Plant would become employees of WPCo. Under the proposed Ownership Agreement, WPCo is obligated to purchase KPCo\u2019s 50% interest in the Mitchell Plant on December 31, 2028 unless KPCo and WPCo have agreed to retire the Mitchell Plant earlier or, absent such agreement, if WPCo elects prior to December 31, 2027 to retire the Mitchell Plant on December 31, 2028. The Ownership Agreement provides that the purchase price for KPCo\u2019s 50% ownership interest in the Mitchell Plant will be determined through the mutual agreement of WPCo and KPCo (subject to approval from the KPSC and WVPSC) or through a fair market valuation determination conducted by independent appraisals, with offsets for estimated decommissioning costs and the cost of ELG investments made by WPCo, if KPCo and WPCo are unable to reach agreement as to the purchase price.\nIn November 2021, AEP made filings with the KPSC, WVPSC, and FERC seeking approval of the new proposed Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement and Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement. Subsequently, the KPSC and WVPSC intervened in the FERC proceeding and have recommended that FERC dismiss or reject AEP\u2019s request, or defer ruling on AEP\u2019s request until both the retail commissions have rendered decisions. In February 2022, AEP filed a motion to withdraw its filing with the FERC, noting that AEP intends to re-file its request after the KPSC and WVPSC have reviewed the agreements. In the WVPSC proceeding, intervenor testimony is expected in March 2022 and a hearing is scheduled to occur in April 2022.\nIn December 2022, Liberty, KPCo and KTCo sought approval from the FERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act for the sale. In February 2022 several intervenors in the case filed protests related to whether the sale will negatively impact the wholesale transmission and generation rates of applicants. An order from the FERC is expected in the matter in April 2022.\nIn January 2022, intervenor testimony was filed with the KPSC, recommending the KPSC either reject the new proposed Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement or approve the agreement with certain modifications including a revision to the buyout provision that would set WPCo\u2019s Mitchell Plant purchase price at the greater of fair market value or net book value. The intervenor testimony also recommends the KPSC reject the proposed Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement, which the testimony stated should be modified to remove references to the Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement. In February 2022, AEP filed rebuttal testimony with the KPSC opposing the intervenor testimony filed in January 2022. AEP\u2019s rebuttal testimony also discusses an alternative proposal to the fair market value provision included in the proposed Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement. Under the alternative proposal, KPCo\u2019s and WPCo\u2019s interest in the Mitchell Plant would be divided by unit if the plant is not retired before the end of 2028 and a mutual agreement cannot be reached on a buyout price. Under the alternative proposal, mutual agreement on the buyout price or unit disposition would need to be finalized by May 2025, with a division of plant ownership by unit effective January 1, 2029, unless otherwise agreed. A hearing on the Mitchell Plant agreements is scheduled with the KPSC in March 2022.\nIn January 2022, KPCo and Liberty filed a joint application requesting the KPSC authorize the transfer of ownership of KPCo to Liberty. In February 2022, certain intervenors filed testimony recommending that the KPSC not approve the transfer of ownership. If, however, the KPSC does approve the transfer, these intervenors recommend that the KPSC require AEP to compensate KPCo customers $578 million for alleged future increased costs and higher rates that the intervenors claim will exist under Liberty\u2019s ownership. AEP disagrees with the recommendation and will file rebuttal testimony in March 2022. Intervenors also recommended imposing certain conditions on Liberty, including conditions related to recovering certain costs, inter-company agreement filing requirements, KPCo\u2019s capital structure and future generation resource planning processes and analyses. In addition, certain intervenors argue that the commission should not approve the new proposed Mitchell Plant Ownership Agreement and Mitchell Plant Operations and Maintenance Agreement, and that deciding the request to transfer ownership of KPCo should be separated from approval of the Mitchell agreements even though such approval is a condition to the transaction closing. AEP also disagrees with this argument. A hearing is scheduled with the KPSC in March 2022 and a final order is expected in the second quarter of 2022.\nThe sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022 with Liberty acquiring the assets and assuming the liabilities of KPCo and KTCo, excluding pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assets and liabilities. AEP expects to provide customary transition services to Liberty for a period of time after closing of the transaction.\nAEP expects to receive approximately $1.45 billion in cash, net of taxes and transaction fees. AEP plans to use the proceeds to eliminate forecasted equity needs in 2022 as the company invests in regulated renewables, transmission and other projects. AEP and AEPTCo expect the sale to have a one-time impact on after tax earnings that is not material.\nThe Income Before Income Tax Expense (Benefit) and Equity Earnings of KPCo and KTCo were not material to AEP and AEPTCo for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe major classes of KPCo and KTCo\u2019s assets and liabilities presented in Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheets of AEP and AEPTCo as of December 31, 2021 are shown in the table below.\nDISPOSITIONS\nDisposition of Racine (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn February 2021, AEP signed an agreement to sell Racine to a nonaffiliated party. The sale of Racine closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 resulting in an immaterial gain which is recorded in Other Operation on AEP\u2019s statements of income.\nConesville Plant (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn June 2020, AEP and a nonaffiliated joint-owner executed an Environmental Liability and Property Transfer and Asset Purchase Agreement with a nonaffiliated third-party related to the merchant Conesville Plant site. The purchaser took ownership of the assets and assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities, including ash pond closure, asbestos abatement and decommissioning and demolition of the Conesville Plant site. In consideration of the transfer of the acquired assets to the purchaser and the purchaser\u2019s assumption of liabilities, AEP will pay a total of approximately $98 million over three years, derecognized $106 million in ARO and recorded an immaterial gain on the transaction which is recorded in Other Operation on the statements of income. AEP paid approximately $26 million at closing in June 2020 and made additional payments totaling $57 million in quarterly installments from October 2020 to December 2021. AEP will make the final $15 million payment by July 2022.\nOklaunion Power Station (Transmission and Distribution Segment and Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas and PSO)\nIn October 2020, AEP Texas, PSO and a nonaffiliated joint-owner executed an Environmental Liability and Property Transfer and Asset Purchase Agreement with a nonaffiliated third-party related to the Oklaunion Power Station site. The purchaser took ownership of the assets and assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities, including ash pond closure, asbestos abatement and decommissioning and demolition of the Oklaunion Power Station site. The sale had an immaterial impact on the financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIMPAIRMENTS\n2020 Texas Base Rate Case (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn January 2022, the PUCT issued a final order adopting the PFD with certain modifications which included a return of investment only for the recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station. As a result of the final order, SWEPCo recorded a disallowance of $12 million associated with the lack of return on the Dolet Hills Power Station. In February 2022, SWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT challenging the denial of reasonable return or carrying costs on the Dolet Hills Power Station. See \u201c2020 Texas Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\n2019 Texas Base Rate Case (Transmission and Distribution Segment) (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nIn December 2019, AEP Texas recorded a pretax impairment of $33 million in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statements of income due to regulatory disallowances in the 2019 Texas Base Rate Case.\nVirginia Jurisdictional Book Value of Retired Coal-Fired Plants (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nIn December 2019, based on management\u2019s interpretation of Virginia law and more certainty regarding APCo\u2019s triennial revenues, expenses and resulting earnings upon reaching the end of the three-year review period, APCo recorded a pretax expense of $93 million in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statements of income related to its previously retired coal-fired generation. As a result, management deemed these costs to be substantially recovered by APCo during the triennial review period. See \u201c2017-2019 Virginia Triennial Review\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\nMerchant Generating Assets (Generation & Marketing Segment)\nDue to a significant increase in the asset retirement costs recorded in December 2019 for the Ash Pond Complex at Conesville Plant, AEP performed an impairment analysis on Conesville Plant in accordance with accounting guidance for impairments of long-lived assets. AEP performed step one and step two of the impairment analysis using a cash flow model for the estimated useful life of Conesville Plant based upon energy and capacity price curves, which were developed internally with both observable Level 2 third-party quotations and unobservable Level 3 inputs, as well as management\u2019s forecasts of operating expenses. The step two analysis resulted in a fair value determination for Conesville Plant of $0 and AEP recorded a $31 million pretax impairment, equal to the net book value of the plant, in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on AEP\u2019s statements of income in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENT\nPlanned Disposition of Competitive Contracted Renewable Assets (Generation & Marketing Segment)\nIn February 2022, AEP management announced the beginning of a process to sell all or a portion of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio included in the Generation & Marketing segment. As of December 31, 2021, the competitive contracted renewable portfolio assets totaled 1.6 gigawatts of generation resources.\n8. BENEFIT PLANS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except AEPTCo unless indicated otherwise.\nFor a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy, see \u201cFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities\u201d and \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d sections of Note 1.\nAEP sponsors a qualified pension plan and two unfunded non-qualified pension plans. Substantially all AEP employees are covered by the qualified plan or both the qualified and a non-qualified pension plan. AEP also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees.\nDue to the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 participation in AEP\u2019s benefit plans, the assumptions used by the actuary, with the exception of the rate of compensation increase, and the accounting for the plans by each subsidiary are the same. This section details the assumptions that apply to all Registrants and the rate of compensation increase for each Registrant.\nThe Registrants recognize the funded status associated with defined benefit pension and OPEB plans on the balance sheets. Disclosures about the plans are required by the \u201cCompensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d accounting guidance. The Registrants recognize an asset for a plan\u2019s overfunded status or a liability for a plan\u2019s underfunded status, and recognize, as a component of other comprehensive income, the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year that are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The Registrants record a regulatory asset instead of other comprehensive income for qualifying benefit costs of regulated operations that for rate-making purposes are deferred for future recovery. The cumulative funded status adjustment is equal to the remaining unrecognized deferrals for unamortized actuarial losses or gains, prior service costs and transition obligations, such that remaining deferred costs result in an AOCI equity reduction or regulatory asset and deferred gains result in an AOCI equity addition or regulatory liability.\nActuarial Assumptions for Benefit Obligations\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the Registrants\u2019 benefit obligations are shown in the following tables:\nPension Plans OPEB\nDecember 31,\nAssumption 2021 2020 2021 2020\nDiscount Rate 2.90 % 2.50 % 2.90 % 2.55 %\nInterest Crediting Rate 4.00 % 4.00 % NA NA\nNA Not applicable.\n(a)Rates are for base pay only. In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and overtime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees.\nA duration-based method is used to determine the discount rate for the plans. A hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan liability. The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio is used as the discount rate for the plan. The discount rate is the same for each Registrant.\nFor 2021, the rate of compensation increase assumed varies with the age of the employee, ranging from 3% per year to 11.5% per year, with the average increase shown in the table above. The compensation increase rates reflect variations in each Registrants\u2019 population participating in the pension plan.\nActuarial Assumptions for Net Periodic Benefit Costs\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of each Registrants\u2019 benefit costs are shown in the following tables:\nNA Not applicable.\n(a)Rates are for base pay only. In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and overtime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees.\nThe expected return on plan assets was determined by evaluating historical returns, the current investment climate (yield on fixed income securities and other recent investment market indicators), rate of inflation, third-party forecasts and current prospects for economic growth. The expected return on plan assets is the same for each Registrant.\nThe health care trend rate assumptions used for OPEB plans measurement purposes are shown below:\nSignificant Concentrations of Risk within Plan Assets\nIn addition to establishing the target asset allocation of plan assets, the investment policy also places restrictions on securities to limit significant concentrations within plan assets. The investment policy establishes guidelines that govern maximum market exposure, security restrictions, prohibited asset classes, prohibited types of transactions, minimum credit quality, average portfolio credit quality, portfolio duration and concentration limits. The guidelines were established to mitigate the risk of loss due to significant concentrations in any investment. Management monitors the plans to control security diversification and ensure compliance with the investment policy. As of December 31, 2021, the assets were invested in compliance with all investment limits. See \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1 for limit details.\nBenefit Plan Obligations, Plan Assets, Funded Status and Amounts Recognized on the Balance Sheets\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the pension plans had an actuarial gain primarily due to an increase in the discount rate, partially offset by less favorable demographic experience than expected, resulting from the updated census information as of January 1, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the OPEB plans had an actuarial gain primarily due to an increase in the discount rate and an update of the projected reimbursements from the Employer Group Waiver Program under Medicare Part D. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the pension plans had an actuarial loss primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by a decrease in the assumed rate used to convert account balances to annuities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the OPEB plans had an actuarial loss primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate and an update to the health care trend assumption, partially offset by updated projected per capita claims costs due to rate negotiations for Medicare advantage premium rates. The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the plans\u2019 benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, funded status and the presentation on the balance sheets. The benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation, respectively.\n(a)Contributions to the qualified pension plan were $0 and $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contributions to the non-qualified pension plans were $7 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAmounts Included in Regulatory Assets, Deferred Income Taxes and AOCI\nThe following tables show the components of the plans included in Regulatory Assets, Deferred Income Taxes and AOCI and the items attributable to the change in these components:\n(a)Recorded as a Regulatory Liability as of December 31, 2021 and recorded as a Regulatory Asset as of December 31, 2020.\nDetermination of Pension Expense\nThe determination of pension expense or income is based on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return.\nPension and OPEB Assets\nThe fair value tables within Pension and OPEB Assets present the classification of assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy. All Level 1, 2, 3 and Other amounts can be allocated to the Registrant Subsidiaries using the percentages in the table below:\nThe following table presents the classification of pension plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2021:\n(a)Includes investment securities loaned to borrowers under the securities lending program. See the \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1 for additional information.\n(b)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement.\n(c)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per-share.\nThe following table presents the classification of OPEB plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2021:\n(a)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement.\n(b)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per-share.\nThe following table presents the classification of pension plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020:\n(a)Includes investment securities loaned to borrowers under the securities lending program. See the \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1 for additional information.\n(b)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement.\n(c)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per-share.\nThe following table presents the classification of OPEB plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020:\n(a)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement.\n(b)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per-share.\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans is as follows:\nObligations in Excess of Fair Values\nThe tables below show the underfunded pension plans that had obligations in excess of plan assets.\nProjected Benefit Obligation\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments and Contributions\nThe estimated pension benefit payments and contributions to the trust are at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act plus payment of unfunded non-qualified benefits. For the qualified pension plan, additional discretionary contributions may also be made to maintain the funded status of the plan. For OPEB plans, expected payments include the payment of unfunded benefits. The following table provides the estimated contributions and payments by Registrant for 2022:\nThe tables below reflect the total benefits expected to be paid from the plan or from the Registrants\u2019 assets. The payments include the participants\u2019 contributions to the plan for their share of the cost. Future benefit payments are dependent on the number of employees retiring, whether the retiring employees elect to receive pension benefits as annuities or as lump sum distributions, future integration of the benefit plans with changes to Medicare and other legislation, future levels of interest rates and variances in actuarial results. The estimated payments for the pension benefits and OPEB are as follows:\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost\nThe following tables provide the components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) by Registrant for the plans:\nAmerican Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan\nAEP sponsors the American Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan, a defined contribution retirement savings plan for substantially all employees who are not covered by a retirement savings plan of the UMWA. This qualified plan offers participants an opportunity to contribute a portion of their pay, includes features under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and provides for company matching contributions. The matching contributions to the plan are 100% of the first 1% of eligible employee contributions and 70% of the next 5% of contributions.\nThe following table provides the cost for matching contributions to the retirement savings plans by Registrant:\nUMWA Benefits\nHealth and Welfare Benefits (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nAEP provides health and welfare benefits negotiated with the UMWA for certain unionized employees, retirees and their survivors who meet eligibility requirements. APCo also provides the same UMWA health and welfare benefits for certain unionized mining retirees and their survivors who meet eligibility requirements. AEP and APCo administer the health and welfare benefits and pay them from their general assets.\nMultiemployer Pension Benefits (Applies to AEP)\nUMWA pension benefits are provided through the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan (Employer Identification Number: 52-1050282, Plan Number 002), a multiemployer plan. The UMWA pension benefits are administered by a board of trustees appointed in equal numbers by the UMWA and the Bituminous Coal Operators\u2019 Association (BCOA), an industry bargaining association. AEP makes contributions to the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan based on provisions in its labor agreement and the plan documents. The UMWA pension plan is different from single-employer plans as an employer\u2019s contributions may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. A withdrawing employer may be subject to a withdrawal liability, which is calculated based upon that employer\u2019s share of the plan\u2019s unfunded benefit obligations. If an employer fails to make required contributions or if its payments in connection with its withdrawal liability fall short of satisfying its share of the plan\u2019s unfunded benefit obligations, the remaining employers may be allocated a greater share of the remaining unfunded plan obligations. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), the UMWA pension plan was in Critical Status for the plan year ending June 30, 2021 and in Critical and Declining Status for the plan year ending June 30, 2020, without utilization of extended amortization provisions. As required under the PPA, the Plan adopted a Rehabilitation Plan in 2015. The Rehabilitation Plan has been updated annually, most recently in April 2021.\nThe amounts contributed by AEP affiliates in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were immaterial and represent less than 5% of the total contributions in the plan\u2019s latest annual report based on the plan year ended June 30, 2020. The contributions in 2021, 2020 and 2019 did not include surcharges.\nUnder the terms of the UMWA pension plan, contributions will be required to continue beyond the March 31, 2023 expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement between the Cook Coal Terminal (CCT) facility and the UMWA, whether or not the term of that agreement is extended or a subsequent agreement is entered, so long as both the UMWA pension plan remains in effect and an AEP affiliate continues to operate the facility covered by the current collective bargaining agreement. The contribution rate applicable would be determined in accordance with the terms of the UMWA pension plan by reference to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement, subject to periodic revisions, between the UMWA and the BCOA. If the UMWA pension plan would terminate or an AEP affiliate would cease operation of the facility without arranging for a successor operator to assume its liability, the withdrawal liability obligation would be triggered.\nBased upon the planned closure of CCT in 2022, AEP records a UMWA pension withdrawal liability on the balance sheet. The UMWA pension withdrawal liability is re-measured annually and is the estimated value of the company\u2019s anticipated contributions toward its proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the liability balance was $22 million and $25 million, respectively. AEP recovers the estimated value of its UMWA pension withdrawal liability through fuel clauses in certain regulated jurisdictions. AEP records a regulatory asset on the balance sheets when the UMWA pension withdrawal liability exceeds the cumulative billings collected and a regulatory liability on the balance sheets when the cumulative billings collected exceed the withdrawal liability. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, AEP recorded a regulatory asset on the balance sheets for $1 million and $6 million, respectively. If any portion of the UMWA pension withdrawal liability is not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n9. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nAEP\u2019s Reportable Segments\nAEP\u2019s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements.\nAEP\u2019s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below:\nVertically Integrated Utilities\n\u2022Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.\nTransmission and Distribution Utilities\n\u2022Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo.\n\u2022OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve standard service offer customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load.\nAEP Transmission Holdco\n\u2022Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEPTCo. These investments have FERC-approved returns on equity.\n\u2022Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP\u2019s transmission-only joint ventures. These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved returns on equity.\nGeneration & Marketing\n\u2022Contracted renewable energy investments and management services.\n\u2022Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, MISO, PJM and SPP.\n\u2022Competitive generation in PJM.\nThe remainder of AEP\u2019s activities are presented as Corporate and Other. While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent\u2019s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense, income tax expense and other nonallocated costs.\nThe tables below present AEP\u2019s reportable segment income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and reportable segment balance sheet information as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(a)Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries. This segment also includes Parent\u2019s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income, interest expense and other nonallocated costs.\n(b)Includes elimination of AEP Parent\u2019s investments in wholly-owned subsidiary companies.\n(c)Reconciling Adjustments for Total Assets primarily include elimination of intercompany advances to affiliates and intercompany accounts receivable.\n(d)Amounts reflect the impact of fair value hedge accounting. See \u201cAccounting for Fair Value Hedging Strategies\u201d section of Note 10 for additional information.\n(e)Amount includes Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n(f)Includes eliminations due to an intercompany finance lease.\nRegistrant Subsidiaries\u2019 Reportable Segments (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrant Subsidiaries each have one reportable segment, an integrated electricity generation, transmission and distribution business for APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo, and an integrated electricity transmission and distribution business for AEP Texas and OPCo. Other activities are insignificant. The Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 operations are managed on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost structures and operating results.\nAEPTCo\u2019s Reportable Segments\nAEPTCo Parent is the holding company of seven FERC-regulated transmission-only electric utilities. The seven State Transcos have been identified as operating segments of AEPTCo under the accounting guidance for \u201cSegment Reporting.\u201d The State Transcos business consists of developing, constructing and operating transmission facilities at the request of the RTOs in which they operate and in replacing and upgrading facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP transmission system as needed to maintain reliability standards and provide service to AEP\u2019s wholesale and retail customers. The State Transcos are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems.\nAEPTCo\u2019s Chief Operating Decision Maker makes operating decisions, allocates resources to and assesses performance-based on these operating segments. The seven State Transcos operating segments all have similar economic characteristics and meet all of the criteria under the accounting guidance for \u201cSegment Reporting\u201d to be aggregated into one operating segment. As a result, AEPTCo has one reportable segment. The remainder of AEPTCo\u2019s activity is presented in AEPTCo Parent. While not considered a reportable segment, AEPTCo Parent represents the activity of the holding company which primarily relates to debt financing activity and general corporate activities.\nThe tables below present AEPTCo\u2019s reportable segment income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and reportable segment balance sheet information as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(a) Elimination of intercompany interest income/interest expense on affiliated debt arrangement.\n(b) Includes elimination of AEPTCo Parent\u2019s equity earnings in the State Transcos.\n(c) Elimination of intercompany debt.\n(d) Includes elimination of AEPTCo Parent\u2019s investments in the State Transcos.\n(e) Primarily relates to elimination of Notes Receivable from the State Transcos.\n(f) Amount includes Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n10. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. For the periods presented, AEPTCo did not have any derivative and hedging activity.\nOBJECTIVES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nAEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of certain AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries. AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries.\nThe Registrants are exposed to certain market risks as major power producers and participants in the electricity, capacity, natural gas, coal and emission allowance markets. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact the Registrants due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. Management utilizes derivative instruments to manage these risks.\nSTRATEGIES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES\nRisk Management Strategies\nThe strategy surrounding the use of derivative instruments primarily focuses on managing risk exposures, future cash flows and creating value utilizing both economic and formal hedging strategies. The risk management strategies also include the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes which focus on seizing market opportunities to create value driven by expected changes in the market prices of the commodities. To accomplish these objectives, the Registrants primarily employ risk management contracts including physical and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options. Not all risk management contracts meet the definition of a derivative under the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d Derivative risk management contracts elected normal under the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception are not subject to the requirements of this accounting guidance.\nThe Registrants utilize power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business. The Registrants utilize interest rate derivative contracts in order to manage the interest rate exposure associated with the commodity portfolio. For disclosure purposes, such risks are grouped as \u201cCommodity,\u201d as these risks are related to energy risk management activities. The Registrants also utilize derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk associated with debt financing. For disclosure purposes, these risks are grouped as \u201cInterest Rate.\u201d The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe following tables represent the gross notional volume of the Registrants\u2019 outstanding derivative contracts:\nFair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP)\nParent enters into interest rate derivative transactions as part of an overall strategy to manage the mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. Certain interest rate derivative transactions effectively modify exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of fixed-rate debt to a floating-rate. Provided specific criteria are met, these interest rate derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges.\nCash Flow Hedging Strategies\nThe Registrants utilize cash flow hedges on certain derivative transactions for the purchase-and-sale of power (\u201cCommodity\u201d) in order to manage the variable price risk related to forecasted purchases and sales. Management monitors the potential impacts of commodity price changes and, where appropriate, enters into derivative transactions to protect profit margins for a portion of future electricity sales and purchases. The Registrants do not hedge all commodity price risk.\nThe Registrants utilize a variety of interest rate derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate risk exposure. The Registrants also utilize interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate exposure related to future borrowings of fixed-rate debt. The Registrants do not hedge all interest rate exposure.\nACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d requires recognition of all qualifying derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets at fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments accounted for using MTM accounting or hedge accounting are based on exchange prices and broker quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes and other assumptions. In order to determine the relevant fair values of the derivative instruments, the Registrants apply valuation adjustments for discounting, liquidity and credit quality.\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform on the contract or fail to pay amounts due. Liquidity risk represents the risk that imperfections in the market will cause the price to vary from estimated fair value based upon prevailing market supply and demand conditions. Since energy markets are imperfect and volatile, there are inherent risks related to the underlying assumptions in models used to fair value risk management contracts. Unforeseen events may cause reasonable price curves to differ from actual price curves throughout a contract\u2019s term and at the time a contract settles. Consequently, there could be significant adverse or favorable effects on future net income and cash flows if market prices are not consistent with management\u2019s estimates of current market consensus for forward prices in the current period. This is particularly true for longer term contracts. Cash flows may vary based on market conditions, margin requirements and the timing of settlement of risk management contracts.\nAccording to the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging,\u201d the Registrants reflect the fair values of derivative instruments subject to netting agreements with the same counterparty net of related cash collateral. For certain risk management contracts, the Registrants are required to post or receive cash collateral based on third-party contractual agreements and risk profiles. AEP netted cash collateral received from third-parties against short-term and long-term risk management assets in the amounts of $263 million and $3 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. AEP netted cash collateral paid to third-parties against short-term and long-term risk management liabilities in the amounts of $3 million and $7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The netted cash collateral from third-parties against short-term and long-term risk management assets and netted cash collateral paid to third-parties against short-term and long-term risk management liabilities were immaterial for the Registrant Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following tables represent the gross fair value of the Registrants\u2019 derivative activity on the balance sheets:\nAEP\nAEP Texas\nAPCo\nI&M\nOPCo\nPSO\nSWEPCo\n(a)Derivative instruments within these categories are disclosed as gross. These instruments are subject to master netting agreements and are presented on the balance sheets on a net basis in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d\n(b)Amounts include counterparty netting of risk management and hedging contracts and associated cash collateral in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d\n(c)All derivative contracts subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement are offset in the statement of financial position.\n(d)Amount excludes Risk Management Assets of $6 million classified as Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheets. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n(e)Amount excludes Risk Management Liabilities of $0.1 million classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheets. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nThe tables below present the Registrants\u2019 amount of gain (loss) recognized on risk management contracts:\n(a)Represents realized and unrealized gains and losses subject to regulatory accounting treatment recorded as either current or noncurrent on the balance sheets.\nCertain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts, as provided in the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under that accounting guidance are not subject to MTM accounting treatment and are recognized on the statements of income on an accrual basis.\nThe accounting for the changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. Depending on the exposure, management designates a hedging instrument as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\nFor contracts that have not been designated as part of a hedging relationship, the accounting for changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative instrument is held for trading purposes. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments held for trading purposes are included in revenues on a net basis on the statements of income. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments not held for trading purposes are included in revenues or expenses on the statements of income depending on the relevant facts and circumstances. Certain derivatives that economically hedge future commodity risk are recorded in the same line item on the statements of income as that of the associated risk being hedged. However, unrealized and some realized gains and losses in regulated jurisdictions for both trading and non-trading derivative instruments are recorded as regulatory assets (for losses) or regulatory liabilities (for gains) in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations.\u201d\nAccounting for Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP)\nFor fair value hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or an identified portion thereof attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk impacts net income during the period of change.\nAEP records realized and unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting treatment and any offsetting changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nThe following table shows the impacts recognized on the balance sheets related to the hedged items in fair value hedging relationships:\nCarrying Amount of the Hedged\nAssets/(Liabilities) Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Included in the Carrying Amount of the Hedged Assets/(Liabilities)\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\n(in millions)\nLong-term Debt (a) (b) $ (952.3) $ (995.9) $ (8.5) $ (51.7)\n(a)Amounts included on the balance sheets within Long-term Debt Due within One Year and Long-term Debt, respectively.\n(b)Amounts include $(46) million and $(53) million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for the fair value hedge adjustment of hedged debt obligations for which hedge accounting has been discontinued.\nThe pretax effects of fair value hedge accounting on income were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Contracts:\nFair Value Hedging Instruments (a) $ (35.5) $ 41.1 $ 31.9\nFair Value Portion of Long-term Debt (a) 35.5 (41.1) (31.9)\n(a)Gain (Loss) is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nIn June 2020, AEP terminated a $500 million notional amount interest rate swap resulting in the discontinuance of the hedging relationship. A gain of $57 million on the fair value of the hedging instrument was settled in cash and recorded within operating activities on the statement of cash flows. Subsequent to the discontinuation of hedge accounting, the remaining adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item of $57 million will be amortized on a straight-line basis through November 2027 in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nAccounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nFor cash flow hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the Registrants initially report the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets until the period the hedged item affects net income.\nRealized gains and losses on derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of power designated as cash flow hedges are included in Total Revenues or Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income or in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets, depending on the specific nature of the risk being hedged. During the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019, AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives and the Registrant Subsidiaries did not.\nThe Registrants reclassify gains and losses on interest rate derivative hedges related to debt financings from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Interest Expense on the statements of income in those periods in which hedged interest payments occur. During the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019, AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives. During the years ended 2021 and 2020, APCo applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives and the other Registrant Subsidiaries did not. During the year ended 2019, the Registrant Subsidiaries did not apply cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives.\nFor details on effective cash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets and the reasons for changes in cash flow hedges, see Note 3 - Comprehensive Income.\nCash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets were:\nImpact of Cash Flow Hedges on AEP\u2019s Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nCommodity Interest Rate Commodity Interest Rate\n(in millions)\nAOCI Gain (Loss) Net of Tax $ 163.7 $ (21.3) $ (60.6) $ (47.5)\nPortion Expected to be Reclassed to Net Income During the Next Twelve Months 106.7 (3.3) (27.1) (5.7)\nAs of December 31, 2021 the maximum length of time that AEP is hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows related to forecasted transactions is 111 months and 108 months for commodity and interest rate hedges, respectively.\nImpact of Cash Flow Hedges on the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 Balance Sheets\nThe actual amounts reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Net Income can differ from the estimate above due to market price changes.\nCredit Risk\nManagement mitigates credit risk in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis.\nMaster agreements are typically used to facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty and may include collateral requirements. Collateral requirements in the form of cash, letters of credit, surety bonds and parental/affiliate guarantees may be obtained as security from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk. Some master agreements include margining, which requires a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit in the event exposure exceeds the established threshold. The threshold represents an unsecured credit limit which may be supported by a parental/affiliate guaranty, as determined in accordance with AEP\u2019s credit policy. In addition, master agreements allow for termination and liquidation of all positions in the event of a default including a failure or inability to post collateral when required.\nCollateral Triggering Events\nCredit Downgrade Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nA limited number of derivative contracts include collateral triggering events, which include a requirement to maintain certain credit ratings. On an ongoing basis, AEP\u2019s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these collateral triggering events in contracts. The Registrants have not experienced a downgrade below a specified credit rating threshold that would require the posting of additional collateral. AEP had derivative contracts with collateral triggering events in a net liability position as of December 31, 2021, with a total exposure of $9 million. The Registrant Subsidiaries had no derivative contracts with collateral triggering events in a net liability position as of December 31, 2021. The Registrants had no derivative contracts with collateral triggering events in a net liability position as of December 31, 2020.\nCross-Default Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and SWEPCo)\nIn addition, a majority of non-exchange-traded commodity contracts contain cross-default provisions that, if triggered, would permit the counterparty to declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable. These cross-default provisions could be triggered if there was a non-performance event by Parent or the obligor under outstanding debt or a third-party obligation that is $50 million or greater. On an ongoing basis, AEP\u2019s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these cross-default provisions in the contracts. The following tables represent: (a) the fair value of these derivative liabilities subject to cross-default provisions prior to consideration of contractual netting arrangements, (b) the amount that the exposure has been reduced by cash collateral posted and (c) if a cross-default provision would have been triggered, the settlement amount that would be required after considering contractual netting arrangements:\nWarrants Held in Investee (Applies to AEP)\nAEP holds an investment in ChargePoint, which completed an initial public offering (IPO) in February 2021 via a reverse merger with a public special purpose acquisition company. Before the IPO, AEP\u2019s interests in ChargePoint consisted of a noncontrolling equity interest of preferred shares, which were accounted for at their historical cost of $8 million as of December 31, 2020, and common share warrants. After the IPO, AEP\u2019s interests in ChargePoint consisted of a noncontrolling equity interest of common shares, which were accounted for at their fair value of $29 million as of December 31, 2021, and common share warrants. AEP recorded an unrealized gain of $26 million associated with the common shares for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 presented in Other Income (Expense) on AEP\u2019s statements of income.\nManagement has determined the common share warrants are derivative instruments based on the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the warrants were valued at $15 million and $32 million, respectively, and were recorded in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on AEP\u2019s balance sheets. AEP recognized an unrealized loss of $17 million and an unrealized gain of $32 million associated with the warrants for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, presented in Other Income (Expense) on AEP\u2019s statements of income.\nManagement utilized a Black-Scholes options pricing model to value the warrants as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The valuation contemplated a liquidity adjustment that resulted in the overall fair value of the warrants being categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020. After the IPO, there was an observable publicly traded stock price to use in the Black-Scholes options pricing model, which resulted in the warrants being categorized as Level 2 as of December 31, 2021. The common shares are categorized as Level 1 based on the observable publicly traded stock price. See \u201cFair Value Measurements of Financial Assets and Liabilities\u201d section of Note 11 for additional information.\n11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except AEPTCo unless indicated otherwise.\nFair Value Measurements of Long-term Debt (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe fair values of Long-term Debt are based on quoted market prices, without credit enhancements, for the same or similar issues and the current interest rates offered for instruments with similar maturities classified as Level 2 measurement inputs. These instruments are not marked-to-market. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. The fair value of AEP\u2019s Equity Units (Level 1) are valued based on publicly-traded securities issued by AEP.\nThe book values and fair values of Long-term Debt are summarized in the following table:\n(a)The fair value amounts include debt related to AEP\u2019s Equity Units and had a fair value of $1.7 billion and $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See \u201cEquity Units\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information.\n(b)The 2021 book value amount excludes Long-term Debt of $1.1 billion classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheets.

The base cost of equity securities was $641 million and $654 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe fair value of fixed income securities held in the nuclear trust funds, summarized by contractual maturities, as of December 31, 2021 was as follows:\nFair Value Measurements of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFor a discussion of fair value accounting and the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy, see the \u201cFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1.\nThe following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Registrants\u2019 financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. As required by the accounting guidance for \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\u201d financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Management\u2019s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.

INCOME TAXES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe details of the Registrants\u2019 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) as reported are as follows:\n(a)Benefit at AEP is primarily due to an out of period adjustment related to Deferred Income Taxes and Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Management concluded the misstatement and subsequent correction was not material to prior or current period financial statements.\nThe following are reconciliations for the Registrants between the federal income taxes computed by multiplying pretax income by the federal statutory tax rate and the income taxes reported:\n(a)Represents an out of period adjustment related to Deferred Income Taxes and Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Management concluded the misstatement and subsequent correction was not material to prior or current period financial statements.\n(a)Represents an out of period adjustment related to Deferred Income Taxes and Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Management concluded the misstatement and subsequent correction was not material to prior or current period financial statements.\n(a)Represents an out of period adjustment related to Deferred Income Taxes and Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Management concluded the misstatement and subsequent correction was not material to prior or current period financial statements.\nNet Deferred Tax Liability\nThe following tables show elements of the net deferred tax liability and significant temporary differences for each Registrant:\nAEP System Tax Allocation Agreement\nAEP and subsidiaries join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. The allocation of the AEP System\u2019s current consolidated federal income tax to the AEP System companies allocates the benefit of current tax loss of the parent company (Parent Company Loss Benefit) to the AEP System subsidiaries with taxable income reducing their current tax expense proportionately. The consolidated NOL of the AEP System is allocated to each company in the consolidated group with taxable losses. With the exception of the allocation of the consolidated AEP System NOL, the loss of the Parent and tax credits, the method of allocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group.\nFederal and State Income Tax Audit Status\nThe statute of limitations for the IRS to examine AEP and subsidiaries originally filed federal return has expired for tax years 2016 and earlier. In the third quarter of 2019, AEP and subsidiaries elected to amend the 2014 through 2017 federal returns. In the first quarter of 2020, the IRS notified AEP that it was beginning an examination of these amended returns, including the net operating loss carryback to 2015 that originated in the 2017 return. As of December 31, 2021, the IRS has not issued any proposed adjustments and the IRS is limited in their proposed adjustments to the amount AEP claimed on the amended returns. AEP has agreed to extend the statute of limitations on the 2017 tax return to December 31, 2022 to allow time for the audit to be completed and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation to approve the associated refund claim.\nAEP and subsidiaries file income tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions. These taxing authorities routinely examine the tax returns, and AEP and subsidiaries are currently under examination in several state and local jurisdictions. The Registrants are no longer subject to state or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012. In addition, management is monitoring and continues to evaluate the potential impact of federal legislation and corresponding state conformity.\nNet Income Tax Operating Loss Carryforward\nAs of December 31, 2021, AEP has no federal net income tax operating loss carryforward from prior years but does expect to generate a tax operating loss of $674 million for tax year 2021. AEP, AEPTCo, APCo, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo have state net income tax operating loss carryforwards as indicated in the table below:\nAs of December 31, 2021, AEP recorded a valuation allowance of $25 million, against certain state and municipal net income tax operating loss carryforwards since future taxable income is not expected to be sufficient to realize the remaining state net income tax operating loss tax benefits before the carryforward expires. Management anticipates future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the remaining state net income tax operating loss tax benefits before the carryforward expires for each state.\nTax Credit Carryforward\nFederal and state net income tax operating losses sustained in 2016, 2017 and 2019 resulted in unused federal and state income tax credits. As of December 31, 2021, the Registrants have federal tax credit carryforwards and AEP and PSO have state tax credit carryforwards as indicated in the table below. If these credits are not utilized, federal general business tax credits will expire in the years 2036 through 2041 and state tax credits will remain available indefinitely.\nThe Registrants anticipate future federal taxable income will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of the federal tax credits before they expire unused.\nValuation Allowance\nAEP assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate tax character will be generated to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets. When the evaluation of the evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that AEP will not be able to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce existing deferred tax assets to the net realizable amount. Objective evidence evaluated includes whether AEP has a history of recognizing income, future reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.\nValuation allowance activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe reconciliations of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for AEP are presented below. The amount and activity of unrecognized tax benefits for Registrant Subsidiaries was immaterial for periods presented:\nManagement believes that there will be no significant net increase or decrease in unrecognized benefits within 12 months of the reporting date. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate for AEP as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $14 million, $12 million, and $20 million, respectively.\nFederal and State Tax Legislation\nIn March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act includes tax relief provisions including a 5-year NOL carryback from years 2018-2020. In the third quarter of 2020, AEP requested a $95 million refund of taxes paid in 2014 under the 5-year NOL carryback provision of the CARES Act. AEP carried back a NOL generated on the 2019 Federal income tax return at a 21% federal corporate income tax rate to the 2014 Federal income tax return at a 35% corporate income tax rate. As a result of the change in the corporate income tax rates between the two periods, AEP realized a tax benefit of $48 million during the third quarter of 2020 primarily at the Generation & Marketing segment. AEP received the $95 million refund in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nIn March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the \u201cAmerican Rescue Plan\u201d) was signed into law. The American Rescue Plan was a COVID-19 relief package that addressed a variety of topics, including the non-deductibility of certain executive compensation. Specifically, the American Rescue Plan changes the officers subject to IRC Section 162(m) from the CEO, CFO and three top paid officers to the CEO, CFO and eight top paid officers beginning in 2027.\nIRS Notice 2021-41 was issued in June 2021 by the IRS providing further extension of the continuity safe harbor for PTC and ITC-eligible projects and revising the facts and circumstances rules. For PTC and ITC-eligible projects for which construction began in calendar years 2016 through 2019, the continuity safe harbor is extended to six years. Prior guidance (IRS Notice 2020-41) had only extended the safe harbor for projects beginning in 2016 and 2017 to 5 years. Furthermore, for PTC and ITC-eligible projects for which construction began in 2020, the continuity safe harbor is extended to five years. Under a facts and circumstances analysis, the continuity requirement may be satisfied under either the continuous construction test or the continuous efforts test, regardless of whether the physical work test or the five percent safe harbor is used.\nIn April 2021, West Virginia enacted House Bill (HB) 2026. HB 2026 changes the state income tax apportionment formula from a ratio that includes property, payroll and sales to a single sales factor apportionment regime effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. HB 2026 also eliminates the \u201cthrow out\u201d rule related to sales of tangible personal property for sales factor apportionment calculation purposes and introduces a market-based sourcing for sales of services and intangible property. During 2021, AEP recorded $23 million in Income Tax Expense as a result of remeasuring West Virginia deferred taxes under the new apportionment methodology. The enacted legislation does not impact AEP Texas, PSO or SWEPCo.\nIn May 2021, Oklahoma enacted HB 2960. HB 2960 reduces the Oklahoma corporate income tax rate from 6% to 4%. During 2021, AEP recorded an immaterial amount of Income Tax Benefit as a result of remeasuring Oklahoma deferred taxes at the lowered statutory tax rate of 4%. The enacted legislation does not impact APCo, I&M or OPCo.\nIn November 2021, Louisiana approved Constitutional Amendment 2, thereby also enacting HB 292. HB 292 reduces the Louisiana corporate income tax rate from 8% to 7.5%. In the fourth quarter of 2021, AEP recorded an immaterial amount of Income Tax Expense as a result of remeasuring Louisiana deferred taxes at the lowered statutory tax rate of 7.5%. The enacted legislation does not impact AEP Texas, APCo, I&M, OPCo or PSO.\nIn December 2021, Arkansas enacted HB 1001. HB 1001 reduces the Arkansas corporate income tax rate from 5.9% to 5.7%, with additional reductions to 5.3% contingent upon future events. In the fourth quarter of 2021, AEP recorded an immaterial amount of Income Tax Expense as a result of remeasuring Arkansas deferred taxes at the lowered statutory tax rate of 5.7%. The enacted legislation does not impact AEP Texas, APCo, I&M, OPCo or PSO.\n13. LEASES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants lease property, plant and equipment including, but not limited to, fleet, information technology and real estate leases. These leases require payments of non-lease components, including related property taxes, operating and maintenance costs. AEP does not separate non-lease components from associated lease components. Many of these leases have purchase or renewal options. Leases not renewed are often replaced by other leases. Options to renew or purchase a lease are included in the measurement of lease assets and liabilities if it is reasonably certain the Registrant will exercise the option.\nLease obligations are measured using the discount rate implicit in the lease when that rate is readily determinable. AEP has visibility into the rate implicit in the lease when assets are leased from selected financial institutions under master leasing agreements. When the implicit rate is not readily determinable, the Registrants measure their lease obligation using their estimated secured incremental borrowing rate. Incremental borrowing rates are comprised of an underlying risk-free rate and a secured credit spread relative to the lessee on a matched maturity basis.\nOperating lease rentals and finance lease amortization costs are generally charged to Other Operation and Maintenance expense in accordance with rate-making treatment for regulated operations. The amortization costs related to the Rockport finance lease are charged to Depreciation and Amortization, see \u201cRockport Lease\u201d below for additional information. Interest on finance lease liabilities is generally charged to Interest Expense. Lease costs associated with capital projects are included in Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets. For regulated operations with finance leases, a finance lease asset and offsetting liability are recorded at the present value of the remaining lease payments for each reporting period. Finance leases for nonregulated property are accounted for as if the assets were owned and financed. The components of rental costs were as follows:\n(a)Excludes variable and short-term lease costs, which were immaterial.\nSupplemental information related to leases are shown in the tables below:\nThe following tables show property, plant and equipment under finance leases and noncurrent assets under operating leases and related obligations recorded on the balance sheets. Unless shown as a separate line on the balance sheets due to materiality, net operating lease assets are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets, current finance lease obligations are included in Other Current Liabilities and long-term finance lease obligations are included in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets. Lease obligations are not recognized on the balance sheets for lease agreements with a lease term of less than twelve months.\n(a) Amount excludes $3 million of Net Property, Plant and Equipment Under Finance Leases classified as Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n(b) Amount excludes $3 million of Obligations Under Finance Leases classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n(a) Amount excludes $11 million of Operating Lease Assets classified as Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n(b) Amount excludes $11 million of Obligations Under Operating Leases classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nFuture minimum lease payments consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021:\n(a) Amount excludes $3 million of Obligations Under Finance Leases classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n(a) Amount excludes $11 million of Obligations Under Operating Leases classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nMaster Lease Agreements (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants lease certain equipment under master lease agreements. Under the lease agreements, the lessor is guaranteed a residual value up to a stated percentage of the equipment cost at the end of the lease term. If the actual fair value of the leased equipment is below the guaranteed residual value at the end of the lease term, the Registrants are committed to pay the difference between the actual fair value and the residual value guarantee. Historically, at the end of the lease term the fair value has been in excess of the amount guaranteed. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum potential loss by the Registrants for these lease agreements assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the lease term was as follows:\nRockport Lease (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nAEGCo and I&M entered into a sale-and-leaseback transaction in 1989 with Wilmington Trust Company (Owner Trustee), an unrelated, unconsolidated trustee for Rockport Plant, Unit 2. The trusts were capitalized with equity from six owner participants with no relationship to AEP or any of its subsidiaries and debt from a syndicate of banks and securities in a private placement to certain institutional investors.\nThe trusts own undivided interests in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 and leases equal portions to AEGCo and I&M. In April 2021, AEGCo and I&M executed an agreement to purchase 100% of the interests in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 effective at the end of the lease term in December 2022. In December 2021, AEGCo and I&M satisfied the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the acquisition. Upon receipt of the regulatory approvals, the addition of the lessee forward purchase obligation resulted in the modified lease changing classification from operating to finance for AEGCo and I&M. The future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2021, inclusive of the purchase obligation, were as follows:\n(a) AEP\u2019s future minimum lease payments include equal shares from AEGCo and I&M.\nThe lease modification also created variable interests in the trusts that own the undivided interests in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 for I&M and AEGCo. Neither I&M nor AEGCo are the primary beneficiaries of the trusts because AEGCo nor I&M has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trusts. AEP and I&M\u2019s maximum exposure to loss associated with the trusts is equal to the total future minimum lease payments, inclusive of the purchase obligation, as shown in the table above.\nAEPRO Boat and Barge Leases (Applies to AEP)\nIn 2015, AEP sold its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party. Certain boat and barge leases acquired by the nonaffiliated party are subject to an AEP guarantee in favor of the respective lessors, ensuring future payments under such leases with maturities up to 2027. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum potential amount of future payments required under the guaranteed leases was $42 million. Under the terms of certain of the arrangements, upon the lessors exercising their rights after an event of default by the nonaffiliated party, AEP is entitled to enter into new lease arrangements as a lessee that would have substantially the same terms as the existing leases. Alternatively, for the arrangements with one of the lessors, upon an event of default by the nonaffiliated party and the lessor exercising its rights, payment to the lessor would allow AEP to step into the lessor\u2019s rights as well as obtaining title to the assets. Under either situation, AEP would have the ability to utilize the assets in the normal course of barging operations. AEP would also have the right to sell the acquired assets for which it obtained title. As of December 31, 2021, AEP\u2019s boat and barge lease guarantee liability was $2 million, of which $1 million was recorded in Other Current Liabilities and $1 million was recorded in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on AEP\u2019s balance sheet.\nIn February 2020, the nonaffiliated party filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The party entered into a restructuring support agreement and has announced it expects to continue their operations as normal. In March 2020, the bankruptcy court approved the party\u2019s recapitalization plan. In April 2020, the nonaffiliated party emerged from bankruptcy. Management has determined that it is reasonably possible that enforcement of AEP\u2019s liability for future payments under these leases will be exercised within the next twelve months. In such an event, if AEP is unable to sell or incorporate any of the acquired assets into its fleet operations, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nLessor Activity\nThe Registrants\u2019 lessor activity was immaterial as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n14. FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants, unless indicated otherwise.\nCommon Stock (Applies to AEP)\nThe following table is a reconciliation of common stock share activity:\nATM Program\nIn 2020, AEP filed a prospectus supplement and executed an Equity Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which AEP may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1 billion of its common stock through an ATM offering program, including an equity forward sales component. The compensation paid to the selling agents by AEP may be up to 2% of the gross offering proceeds of the shares. For the year ended December 31, 2021, AEP issued 5,701,825 shares of common stock and received net cash proceeds of $484 million under the ATM program.\nLong-term Debt\nThe following table details long-term debt outstanding:\n(a)For certain series of Pollution Control Bonds, interest rates are subject to periodic adjustment. Certain series may be purchased on demand at periodic interest adjustment dates. Letters of credit from banks and insurance policies support certain series. Consequently, these bonds have been classified for maturity purposes as Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets.\n(b)Certain Pollution Control Bonds are subject to redemption earlier than the maturity date.\n(c)Notes payable represent outstanding promissory notes issued under term loan agreements and credit agreements with a number of banks and other financial institutions. At expiration, all notes then issued and outstanding are due and payable. Interest rates are both fixed and variable. Variable rates generally relate to specified short-term interest rates.\n(d)Dates represent the scheduled final payment dates for the securitization bonds. The legal maturity date is one to two years later. These bonds have been classified for maturity and repayment purposes based on the scheduled final payment date.\n(e)Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligation consists of a liability along with accrued interest for disposal of SNF. See \u201cSpent Nuclear Fuel Disposal\u201d section of Note 6 for additional information.\n(f)See \u201cEquity Units\u201d section below for additional information.\n(g)2021 amount excludes $1.1 billion of Total Long-term Debt Outstanding classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2021, outstanding long-term debt was payable as follows:\n(a) Amount includes $850 million of Junior Subordinated Notes. See \u201cEquity Units\u201d section below for additional information.\n(b) Amount includes $805 million of Junior Subordinated Notes. See \u201cEquity Units\u201d section below for additional information.\n(c) Amount excludes $1.1 billion of Total Long-term Debt Outstanding classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nLong-term Debt Subsequent Events\nIn January and February 2022, I&M retired $8 million and $8 million, respectively, of Notes Payable related to DCC Fuel.\nIn February 2022, PSO issued $500 million of variable rate Other Long-term Debt due in 2022.\nIn February 2022, AEP Texas retired $11 million of Securitization Bonds.\nIn February 2022, APCo retired $13 million of Securitization Bonds.\nEquity Units (Applies to AEP)\n2020 Equity Units\nIn August 2020, AEP issued 17 million Equity Units initially in the form of corporate units, at a stated amount of $50 per unit, for a total stated amount of $850 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $833 million. The proceeds were used to support AEP\u2019s overall capital expenditure plans.\nEach corporate unit represents a 1/20 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of AEP\u2019s 1.30% Junior Subordinated Notes (notes) due in 2025 and a forward equity purchase contract which settles after three years in 2023. The notes are expected to be remarketed in 2023, at which time the interest rate will reset at the then-current market rate. Investors may choose to remarket their notes to receive the remarketing proceeds and use those funds to settle the forward equity purchase contract, or accept the remarketed debt and use other funds for the equity purchase. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, investors have the right to put their notes to AEP at a price equal to the principal. The Equity Units carry an annual distribution rate of 6.125%, which is comprised of a quarterly coupon rate of interest of 1.30% and a quarterly forward equity purchase contract payment of 4.825%.\nEach forward equity purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and AEP to sell, for $50 a number of shares in common stock in accordance with the conversion ratios set forth below (subject to an anti-dilution adjustment):\n\u2022If the AEP common stock market price is equal to or greater than $99.95: 0.5003 shares per contract.\n\u2022If the AEP common stock market price is less than $99.95 but greater than $83.29: a number of shares per contract equal to $50 divided by the applicable market price. The holder receives a variable number of shares at $50.\n\u2022If the AEP common stock market price is less than or equal to $83.29: 0.6003 shares per contract.\nA holder\u2019s ownership interest in the notes is pledged to AEP to secure the holder\u2019s obligation under the related forward equity purchase contract. If a holder of the forward equity purchase contract chooses at any time to no longer be a holder of the notes, such holder\u2019s obligation under the forward equity purchase contract must be secured by a U.S. Treasury security which must be equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes.\nAt the time of issuance, the $850 million of notes were recorded within Long-term Debt on the balance sheets. The present value of the purchase contract payments of $121 million were recorded in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities with a current portion in Other Current Liabilities at the time of issuance, representing the obligation to make forward equity contract payments, with an offsetting reduction to Paid-in Capital. The difference between the face value and present value of the purchase contract payments will be accreted to Interest Expense on the statements of income over the three year period ending in 2023. The liability recorded for the contract payments is considered non-cash and excluded from the statements of cash flows. Until settlement of the forward equity purchase contract, earnings per-share dilution resulting from the equity unit issuance will be determined under the treasury stock method. The maximum amount of shares AEP will be required to issue to settle the purchase contract is 10,205,100 shares (subject to an anti-dilution adjustment).\n2019 Equity Units\nIn March 2019, AEP issued 16.1 million Equity Units initially in the form of corporate units, at a stated amount of $50 per unit, for a total stated amount of $805 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $785 million. The proceeds were used to support AEP\u2019s overall capital expenditure plans including the acquisition of Sempra Renewables LLC.\nEach corporate unit represents a 1/20 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of AEP\u2019s 3.40% Junior Subordinated Notes (notes) due in 2024 and a forward equity purchase contract which settles after three years in 2022. In January 2022, AEP successfully remarketed the notes on behalf of holders of the corporate units and did not directly receive any proceeds therefrom. Instead, the holders of the corporate units may use the debt remarketing proceeds towards settling the forward equity purchase contract with AEP in March 2022. The interest rate on the notes was reset to 2.031% with the maturity remaining in 2024.\nEach forward equity purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and AEP to sell, for $50 a number of shares in common stock in accordance with the conversion ratios set forth below (subject to an anti-dilution adjustment):\n\u2022If the AEP common stock market price is equal to or greater than $99.58: 0.5021 shares per contract.\n\u2022If the AEP common stock market price is less than $99.58 but greater than $82.98: a number of shares per contract equal to $50 divided by the applicable market price. The holder receives a variable number of shares at $50.\n\u2022If the AEP common stock market price is less than or equal to $82.98: 0.6026 shares per contract.\nA holder\u2019s ownership interest in the notes is pledged to AEP to secure the holder\u2019s obligation under the related forward equity purchase contract. If a holder of the forward equity purchase contract chooses at any time to no longer be a holder of the notes, such holder\u2019s obligation under the forward equity purchase contract must be secured by a U.S. Treasury security which must be equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes.\nAt the time of issuance, the $805 million of notes were recorded within Long-term Debt on the balance sheets. The present value of the purchase contract payments of $62 million were recorded in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities with a current portion in Other Current Liabilities at the time of issuance, representing the obligation to make forward equity contract payments, with an offsetting reduction to Paid-in Capital. The difference between the face value and present value of the purchase contract payments will be accreted to Interest Expense on the statements of income over the three year period ending in 2022. The liability recorded for the contract payments is considered non-cash and excluded from the statements of cash flows. Until settlement of the forward equity purchase contract, earnings per-share dilution resulting from the equity unit issuance will be\ndetermined under the treasury stock method. The maximum amount of shares AEP will be required to issue to settle the purchase contract is 9,701,860 shares (subject to an anti-dilution adjustment).\nDebt Covenants (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)\nCovenants in AEPTCo\u2019s note purchase agreements and indenture limit the amount of contractually-defined priority debt (which includes a further sub-limit of $50 million of secured debt) to 10% of consolidated tangible net assets. AEPTCo\u2019s contractually-defined priority debt was 1.1% of consolidated tangible net assets as of December 31, 2021. The method for calculating the consolidated tangible net assets is contractually-defined in the note purchase agreement.\nDividend Restrictions\nUtility Subsidiaries\u2019 Restrictions\nParent depends on its utility subsidiaries to pay dividends to shareholders. AEP utility subsidiaries pay dividends to Parent provided funds are legally available. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends.\nAll of the dividends declared by AEP\u2019s utility subsidiaries that provide transmission or local distribution services are subject to a Federal Power Act restriction that prohibits the payment of dividends out of capital accounts without regulatory approval; payment of dividends is allowed out of retained earnings only. The Federal Power Act also creates a reserve on retained earnings attributable to hydroelectric generation plants. Because of their ownership of such plants, this reserve applies to APCo and I&M.\nCertain AEP subsidiaries have credit agreements that contain covenants that limit their debt to capitalization ratio to 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in the credit agreements.\nThe most restrictive dividend limitation for certain AEP subsidiaries is through the Federal Power Act restriction, while for other AEP subsidiaries the most restrictive dividend limitation is through the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum amount of restricted net assets of AEP\u2019s subsidiaries that may not be distributed to the Parent in the form of a loan, advance or dividend was $15.5 billion.\nThe Federal Power Act restriction limits the ability of the AEP subsidiaries owning hydroelectric generation to pay dividends out of retained earnings. Additionally, the credit agreement covenant restrictions can limit the ability of the AEP subsidiaries to pay dividends out of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of any such restrictions were as follows:\nAEP AEP Texas AEPTCo APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nRestricted Retained Earnings\n$ 2,655.2 (a) $ 791.8 $ - $ 313.4 $ 648.5 $ - $ - $ 577.9\n(a) Includes the restrictions of consolidated and non-consolidated subsidiaries.\nParent Restrictions (Applies to AEP)\nThe holders of AEP\u2019s common stock are entitled to receive the dividends declared by the Board of Directors provided funds are legally available for such dividends. Parent\u2019s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries.\nPursuant to the leverage restrictions in credit agreements, AEP must maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization\nis contractually-defined in the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2021, AEP had $8.2 billion of available retained earnings to pay dividends to common shareholders. AEP paid $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of dividends to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nLines of Credit and Short-term Debt (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nAEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries. The program funds a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP\u2019s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries; and the short-term debt requirements of subsidiaries that are not participating in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons, as direct borrowers. As of December 31, 2021, AEP had $5 billion in revolving credit facilities to support its commercial paper program. The commercial paper program for the year ended 2021, had a weighted-average interest rate of 0.24% and a maximum amount outstanding of $2.5 billion. AEP\u2019s outstanding short-term debt was as follows:\n(a) Weighted-average rate.\n(b) Amount of securitized debt for receivables as accounted for under the \u201cTransfers and Servicing\u201d accounting guidance.\nCorporate Borrowing Program - AEP System (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries)\nThe AEP System uses a corporate borrowing program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of AEP\u2019s subsidiaries. The corporate borrowing program includes a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP\u2019s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries; and direct borrowing from AEP. The AEP System Utility Money Pool operates in accordance with the terms and conditions of its agreement filed with the FERC. The amounts of outstanding loans to (borrowings from) the Utility Money Pool as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included in Advances to Affiliates and Advances from Affiliates, respectively, on the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets. The Utility Money Pool participants\u2019 money pool activity and corresponding authorized borrowing limits are described in the following tables:\nYear Ended December 31, 2021:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020:\n(a) Amount represents the combined authorized short-term borrowing limit the State Transcos have from FERC or state regulatory commissions.\n(b) Amount excludes $1 million of Advances from Affiliates classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the AEP Transco balance sheet. See \u201cDispositions of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nThe activity in the above tables does not include short-term lending activity of certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries. AEP Texas\u2019 wholly-owned subsidiary, AEP Texas North Generation Company, LLC and SWEPCo\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Mutual Energy SWEPCo, LLC participate in the Nonutility Money Pool. The amounts of outstanding loans to the Nonutility Money Pool as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included in Advances to Affiliates on each subsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets. The Nonutility Money Pool participants\u2019 money pool activity is described in the following tables:\nYear Ended December 31, 2021:\nMaximum Loans Average Loans Loans to the Nonutility\nto the Nonutility to the Nonutility Money Pool as of\nCompany Money Pool Money Pool December 31, 2021\n(in millions)\nAEP Texas $ 7.1 $ 6.9 $ 6.9\nSWEPCo 2.1 2.1 2.1\nYear Ended December 31, 2020:\nMaximum Loans Average Loans Loans to the Nonutility\nto the Nonutility to the Nonutility Money Pool as of\nCompany Money Pool Money Pool December 31, 2020\n(in millions)\nAEP Texas $ 7.5 $ 7.1 $ 7.1\nSWEPCo 2.1 2.1 2.1\nAEP has a direct financing relationship with AEPTCo to meet its short-term borrowing needs. The amounts of outstanding loans to and borrowings from AEP as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included in Advances to Affiliates and Advances from Affiliates, respectively, on AEPTCo\u2019s balance sheets. AEPTCo\u2019s direct financing activities with AEP and corresponding authorized borrowing limits are described in the following tables:\nYear Ended December 31, 2021:\nMaximum Maximum Average Average Borrowings from Loans to Authorized\nBorrowings Loans Borrowings Loans AEP as of AEP as of Short-term\nfrom AEP to AEP from AEP to AEP December 31, 2021 December 31, 2021 Borrowing Limit\n(in millions)\n$ 14.6 $ 224.2 $ 1.8 $ 118.0 $ 1.5 $ 12.7 $ 50.0 (a)\nYear Ended December 31, 2020:\nMaximum Maximum Average Average Borrowings from Loans to Authorized\nBorrowings Loans Borrowings Loans AEP as of AEP as of Short-term\nfrom AEP to AEP from AEP to AEP December 31, 2020 December 31, 2020 Borrowing Limit\n(in millions)\n$ 1.4 $ 215.3 $ 1.3 $ 132.6 $ 1.2 $ 109.0 $ 50.0 (a)\n(a) Amount represents the combined authorized short-term borrowing limit the State Transcos have from FERC or state regulatory commissions.\nThe maximum and minimum interest rates for funds either borrowed from or loaned to the Utility Money Pool are summarized in the following table:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nMaximum Interest Rate 0.48 % 2.70 % 3.43 %\nMinimum Interest Rate 0.02 % 0.27 % 1.77 %\nThe average interest rates for funds borrowed from and loaned to the Utility Money Pool are summarized in the following table:\nMaximum, minimum and average interest rates for funds loaned to the Nonutility Money Pool are summarized in the following table:\nAEPTCo\u2019s maximum, minimum and average interest rates for funds either borrowed from or loaned to AEP are summarized in the following table:\nInterest expense and interest income related to the Utility Money Pool, Nonutility Money Pool and direct borrowing financing relationship are included in Interest Expense and Interest Income, respectively, on each of the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 statements of income. The interest expense and interest income related to the corporate borrowing programs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nCredit Facilities\nSee \u201cLetters of Credit\u201d section of Note 6 for additional information.\nSecuritized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit (Applies to AEP)\nAEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits. Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from the bank conduits for the interest in the receivables AEP Credit acquires from affiliated utility subsidiaries. These securitized transactions allow AEP Credit to repay its outstanding debt obligations, continue to purchase the operating companies\u2019 receivables and accelerate AEP Credit\u2019s cash collections.\nAEP Credit\u2019s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of $750 million from bank conduits to purchase receivables and was amended in September 2021 to include a $125 million and a $625 million facility, which expire in September 2023 and 2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the affiliated utility subsidiaries are in compliance with all requirements under the agreement.\nAccounts receivable information for AEP Credit was as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(dollars in millions)\nEffective Interest Rates on Securitization of Accounts Receivable 0.19 % 0.85 % 2.42 %\nNet Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Written Off $ 26.5 $ 15.3 $ 26.6\nAEP Credit\u2019s delinquent customer accounts receivable represent accounts greater than 30 days past due.\nSecuritized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries, except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nUnder this sale of receivables arrangement, the Registrant Subsidiaries sell, without recourse, certain of their customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenue balances to AEP Credit and are charged a fee based on AEP Credit\u2019s financing costs, administrative costs and uncollectible accounts experience for each Registrant Subsidiary\u2019s receivables. APCo does not have regulatory authority to sell its West Virginia accounts receivable. KPCo terminated selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit in the first quarter of 2022, based on the pending sale to Liberty. As a result of the termination, in the first quarter of 2022, KPCo will record an allowance for uncollectible accounts on its balance sheet for those receivables no longer sold to AEP Credit. The costs of customer accounts receivable sold are reported in Other Operation expense on the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 statements of income. The Registrant Subsidiaries manage and service their customer accounts receivable, which are sold to AEP Credit. AEP Credit securitizes the eligible receivables for the operating companies and retains the remainder.\nThe amount of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues under the sale of receivables agreement were:\nThe fees paid to AEP Credit for customer accounts receivable sold were:\n(a)In 2020, an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts was recognized in response to the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on the collectability of accounts receivable, which caused an increase in fees paid by the registrants. In 2021, due to higher than expected collections of accounts receivables, allowance for doubtful accounts was adjusted resulting in the issuance of credits to offset the higher fees previously paid and to lower subsequent fees paid.\nThe proceeds on the sale of receivables to AEP Credit were:\n15. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP only. The impact of AEP\u2019s share-based compensation plans is insignificant to the financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.\nAwards under AEP\u2019s long-term incentive plan may be granted to employees and directors. The Amended and Restated American Electric Power System Long-Term Incentive Plan (Prior Plan), was replaced prospectively for new grants by the American Electric Power System 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2015 LTIP) effective in April 2015. The 2015 LTIP was subsequently amended in September 2016. The 2015 LTIP provides for a maximum of 10 million AEP common shares to be available for grant to eligible employees and directors. As of December 31, 2021, 5,976,468 shares remained available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP. No new awards may be granted under the Prior Plan. The 2015 LTIP awards may be stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. Shares issued pursuant to a stock option or a stock appreciation right reduce the shares remaining available for grants under the 2015 LTIP by 0.286 of a share. Each share issued for any other award that settles in AEP stock reduces the shares remaining available for grants under the 2015 LTIP by one share. Cash settled awards do not reduce the number of shares remaining available under the 2015 LTIP. The following sections provide further information regarding each type of stock-based compensation award granted under these plans.\nPerformance Shares\nPerformance units granted prior to 2017 were settled in cash rather than AEP common stock and did not reduce the number of shares remaining available under the 2015 LTIP. Those performance units had a fair value upon vesting equal to the average closing market price of AEP common stock for the last 20 trading days of the performance period. Performance shares granted in and after 2017 are settled in AEP common stock and reduce the aggregate share authorization. In all cases the number of performance shares held at the end of the three-year performance period is multiplied by the performance score for such period to determine the actual number of performance shares that participants realize. The performance score can range from 0% to 200% and is determined at the end of the performance period based on performance measures, which include both performance and market conditions, established for each grant at the beginning of the performance period by the Human Resources Committee of AEP\u2019s Board of Directors (HR Committee).\nCertain employees must satisfy a minimum stock ownership requirement. If those employees have not met their stock ownership requirement, a portion or all of their performance shares are mandatorily deferred as AEP career shares to the extent needed to meet their stock ownership requirement. AEP career shares are a form of non-qualified deferred compensation that has a value equivalent to a share of AEP common stock. AEP career shares are settled in AEP common stock after the participant\u2019s termination of employment.\nAEP career shares are recorded in Paid-in Capital on the balance sheets. Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on both performance shares and AEP career shares accrue as additional shares. Management records compensation cost for performance shares over an approximately three-year vesting period. Performance shares are recorded as mezzanine equity on the balance sheets until the vesting date and compensation cost is calculated at fair value based on metrics for each grant. Performance shares granted in 2021 and 2020 have three performance metrics: (a) three-year cumulative operating earnings per-share with a 50% weight, (b) total shareholder return with a 40% weight and (c) non-emitting generation capacity as a percentage of total owned and purchased capacity with a 10% weight. Performance shares granted in 2019 have two equally-weighted performance metrics: (a) three-year cumulative operating earnings per-share and (b) total shareholder return. The three-year cumulative operating earnings per-share metric and non-emitting generating capacity metric are adjusted quarterly for changes in performance relative to a target approved by the HR Committee. The total shareholder return metric is measured relative to a peer group of similar companies and is based on a third-party Monte Carlo valuation. The value related to this metric does not change over the three-year vesting period.\nThe HR Committee awarded performance shares and reinvested dividends on outstanding performance shares and AEP career shares as follows:\n(a)The vesting period for the reinvested dividends on performance shares is equal to the remaining life of the related performance shares. Dividends on AEP career shares vest immediately when the dividend is awarded but are not settled in AEP common stock until after the participant\u2019s AEP employment ends.\nPerformance scores and final awards are determined and approved by the HR Committee in accordance with the pre-established performance measures within approximately two months after the end of the performance period.\nThe certified performance scores and shares earned for the three-year periods were as follows:\n(a)Performance shares settled in AEP common stock in the quarter following the end of the year shown.\nThe settlements were as follows:\nA summary of the status of AEP\u2019s nonvested Performance Shares as of December 31, 2021 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n(a)The vested Performance Shares will be converted to 500 thousand shares based on the closing share price on the day before settlement.\nMonte Carlo Valuation\nAEP engages a third-party for a Monte Carlo valuation to calculate the fair value of the total shareholder return metric for the performance shares awarded during and after 2017. The valuations use a lattice model and the expected volatility assumptions used were the historical volatilities for AEP and the members of their peer group. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo valuations were as follows:\n(a)Period from award date to vesting date.\n(b)Equivalent to reinvesting dividends.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe HR Committee grants restricted stock units (RSUs), which generally vest, subject to the participant\u2019s continued employment, over at least three years in approximately equal annual increments. The RSUs accrue dividends as additional RSUs. The additional RSUs granted as dividends vest on the same date as the underlying RSUs. RSUs are converted into shares of AEP common stock upon vesting, except the RSUs granted prior to 2017 to AEP\u2019s executive officers which settled in cash. Executive officers are those officers who are subject to the disclosure requirements set forth in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For RSUs that settle in shares, compensation cost is measured at fair value on the grant date and recorded over the vesting period. Fair value is determined by multiplying the number of RSUs granted by the grant date market closing price. For RSUs that settled in cash, compensation cost was recorded over the vesting period and adjusted for changes in fair value until vested. The fair value at vesting was determined by multiplying the number of RSUs vested by the 20-day average closing price of AEP common stock. The maximum contractual term of outstanding RSUs is approximately 40 months from the grant date.\nThe HR Committee awarded RSUs, including additional units awarded as dividends, as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nRestricted Stock Units 2021 2020 2019\nAwarded Units (in thousands) 280.0 268.7 304.8\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value $ 80.39 $ 94.38 $ 81.57\nThe total fair value and total intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nRestricted Stock Units 2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nFair Value of Restricted Stock Units Vested $ 20.5 $ 22.9 $ 16.3\nIntrinsic Value of Restricted Stock Units Vested (a) 22.0 25.2 21.6\n(a)Intrinsic value is calculated as market price at the vesting date.\nA summary of the status of AEP\u2019s nonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2021 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nThe total aggregate intrinsic value of nonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2021 was $38 million and the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 1.77 years.\nOther Stock-Based Plans\nAEP also has a Stock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors providing each non-employee director with AEP stock units as a substantial portion of the compensation for their services as a director. The number of stock units provided is based on the closing price of AEP common stock on the last trading day of the quarter for which the stock units were earned. Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on the stock units accrue as additional AEP stock units. The stock units granted to non-employee directors are fully vested on their grant date. Stock units are settled in cash upon termination of board service or up to 10 years later if the participant so elects. Cash settlements for stock units are calculated based on the average closing price of AEP common stock for the last 20 trading days prior to the distribution date. Effective in June 2022, these stock units become payable in AEP common stock rather than cash. After five years of service on the Board of Directors, non-employee directors receive subsequent AEP stock units as contributions to an AEP stock fund awarded under the Stock Unit Accumulation Plan. Such amounts may be exchanged into other market-based investments that are similar to the investment options available to employees that participate in AEP\u2019s Incentive Compensation Deferral Plan. These balances are also paid in cash upon termination of board service or up to 10 years later if the participant so elects.\nManagement records compensation cost for stock units when the units are awarded and adjusts the liability for changes in value based on the current 20-day average closing price of AEP common stock on the valuation date.\nCash settlements for stock unit distributions were $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash settlements for stock unit distributions were immaterial.\nThe Board of Directors awarded stock units, including units awarded for dividends, as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nStock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors 2021 2020 2019\nAwarded Units (in thousands) 12.6 12.1 10.0\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value $ 84.54 $ 83.80 $ 89.13\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nFor share-based payment arrangements the compensation cost, the actual tax benefit from the tax deductions for compensation cost recognized in income and the total compensation cost capitalized were as follows:\n(a)Compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements is included in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses on the statements of income.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $73 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2015 LTIP. Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based arrangements will change as the fair value of performance shares is adjusted each period and as forfeitures for all award types are realized. AEP\u2019s unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.39 years.\nUnder the 2015 LTIP, AEP is permitted to use authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, shares acquired in the open market specifically for distribution under these plans, or any combination thereof to fulfill share commitments. AEP\u2019s current practice is to use authorized but unissued shares to fulfill share commitments. The number of shares used to fulfill share commitments is generally reduced to offset tax withholding obligations.\n16.

Under the PCA, APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo are individually responsible for planning their respective capacity obligations. The PCA allows, but does not obligate, APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo to participate collectively under a common fixed resource requirement capacity plan in PJM and to participate in specified collective Off-system Sales and purchase activities.\nAEPSC conducts power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk management activities on behalf of APCo, I&M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. Certain power and natural gas risk management activities for APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo are allocated based on the four member companies\u2019 respective equity positions, while power and natural gas risk management activities for PSO and SWEPCo are allocated based on the Operating Agreement. With the transfer of OPCo\u2019s generation assets to AGR in 2014, AEPSC conducts only gasoline, diesel fuel, energy procurement and risk management activities on OPCo\u2019s behalf.\nSystem Integration Agreement (Applies to APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nUnder the SIA, AEPSC allocates physical and financial revenues and expenses from transactions with neighboring utilities, power marketers and other power and natural gas risk management activities based upon the location of such activity. Margins resulting from trading and marketing activities originating in PJM generally accrue to the benefit of APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo, while trading and marketing activities originating in SPP generally accrue to the benefit of PSO and SWEPCo. Margins resulting from other transactions are allocated among APCo, I&M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo based upon the equity positions of these companies.\nAffiliated Revenues and Purchases\nThe tables below represent revenues from affiliates, net of respective provisions for refund, by type of revenue for the Registrant Subsidiaries:\n(a)Refer to the Ohio Auctions section below for further information regarding these amounts.\nThe tables below represent the purchased power expenses incurred for purchases from affiliates. AEP Texas, AEPTCo, APCo, PSO and SWEPCo did not purchase any power from affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n(a) Refer to the Ohio Auctions section below for further information regarding this amount.\nThe above summarized related party revenues and expenses are reported in Sales to AEP Affiliates and Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates, respectively, on the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 statements of income. Since the Registrant Subsidiaries are included in AEP\u2019s consolidated results, the above summarized related party transactions are eliminated in total in AEP\u2019s consolidated revenues and expenses.\nPJM and SPP Transmission Service Charges (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries except AEP Texas)\nThe AEP East Companies are parties to the TA, which defines how transmission costs through the PJM OATT are allocated among the AEP East Companies on a 12-month average coincident peak basis. Additional costs for transmission services provided by AEPTCo and other transmission affiliates are billed to AEP East Companies through the PJM OATT.\nThe following table shows the net transmission service charges recorded by APCo, I&M and OPCo:\nThe charges shown above are recorded in Other Operation expenses on the statements of income.\nPSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA in connection with the operation of the transmission assets of PSO and SWEPCo. The TCA has been approved by the FERC and establishes a coordinating committee, which is charged with overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement. This includes the performance of transmission planning studies, the interaction of such companies with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such a tariff.\nUnder the TCA, the parties to the agreement delegated to AEPSC the responsibility of monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on their behalf. The allocations have been governed by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP. Additional costs for transmission services provided by AEPTCo and other transmission affiliates are billed to PSO and SWEPCo through the SPP OATT.\nThe following table shows the net transmission service charges recorded by PSO and SWEPCo:\nYears Ended December 31,\nCompany 2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nPSO $ 94.7 $ 69.7 $ 46.9\nSWEPCo 56.2 31.3 20.1\nThe charges shown above are recorded in Other Operation expenses on the statements of income.\nAEPTCo provides transmission services to affiliates in accordance with the OATT, TA and TCA. AEPTCo recorded affiliated transmission revenues in Sales to AEP Affiliates on the statements of income. Refer to the Affiliated Revenues and Purchases section above for amounts related to these transactions.\nERCOT Transmission Service Charges (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nPursuant to an order from the PUCT, ETT bills AEP Texas for its ERCOT wholesale transmission services. ETT billed AEP Texas $28 million, $28 million and $27 million for transmission services for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The billings are recorded in Other Operation expenses on AEP Texas\u2019 statements of income.\nOklaunion PPA between AEP Texas and AEPEP (Applies to AEP Texas)\nIn 2007, AEP Texas entered into a PPA with an affiliate, AEPEP, whereby AEP Texas agreed to sell AEPEP 100% of AEP Texas\u2019 capacity and associated energy from its undivided interest (54.69%) in the Oklaunion Power Station. The PPA was approved by the FERC. In September 2018, the co-owners of Oklaunion Power Station voted to close the plant in 2020. Effective October 2018, AEP Texas increased depreciation expense to ensure the plant balances are fully depreciated as of September 2020 and recovered through the PPA billings to AEPEP. Under the early termination provisions of the PPA, AEPEP paid AEP Texas the full Property, Plant and Equipment balance through depreciation payments until termination of the PPA due to the plant closing in September 2020. See \u201cDispositions\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nAEP Texas recorded revenue of $0, $88 million and $157 million from AEPEP for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts are included in Sales to AEP Affiliates on AEP Texas\u2019 statements of income.\nJoint License Agreement (Applies to AEPTCo, APCo, I&M, OPCo and PSO)\nAEPTCo entered into a 50-year joint license agreement with APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo and PSO, respectively, allowing either party to occupy the granting party\u2019s facilities or real property. In addition, AEPTCo entered into a 5-year joint license agreement with APCo and WPCo. After the expiration of these agreements, the term shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides notice. The joint license billing provides compensation to the granting party for the cost of carrying assets, including depreciation expense, property taxes, interest expense, return on equity and income taxes. AEPTCo recorded the following costs in Other Operation expense related to these agreements:\nAPCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO and WPCo recorded income related to these agreements in Sales to AEP Affiliates on the statements of income.\nOhio Auctions (Applies to APCo, I&M and OPCo)\nIn connection with OPCo\u2019s June 2012 - May 2015 ESP, the PUCO ordered OPCo to conduct energy and capacity auctions for its entire SSO load for delivery beginning in June 2015. AEP Energy, AEPEP, APCo, KPCo, I&M and WPCo participate in the auction process and have been awarded tranches of OPCo\u2019s SSO load. Refer to the Affiliated Revenues and Purchases section above for amounts related to these transactions.\nUnit Power Agreements (Applies to I&M)\nUPA between AEGCo and I&M\nA UPA between AEGCo and I&M (the I&M Power Agreement) provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the power (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant unless it is sold to another utility. Subsequently, I&M assigns 30% of the power to KPCo. See the \u201cUPA between AEGCo and KPCo\u201d section below. I&M is obligated, whether or not power is available from AEGCo, to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and as an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M) net of amounts received by AEGCo from any other sources, sufficient to enable AEGCo to pay all its operating and other expenses, including a rate of return on the common equity of AEGCo as approved by the FERC. The I&M Power Agreement will continue in effect until the debt obligations of AEGCo secured by the Rockport Plant have been satisfied and discharged (currently expected to be December 2028).\nUPA between AEGCo and KPCo\nPursuant to an assignment between I&M and KPCo and a UPA between AEGCo and KPCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30% of the power (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant. KPCo pays to AEGCo in consideration for the right to receive such power the same amounts which I&M would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the I&M Power Agreement for such entitlement. The KPCo UPA ends in December 2022.\nCook Coal Terminal (Applies to I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nCook Coal Terminal, which is owned by AEGCo, performs coal transloading and storage services at cost for I&M. The coal transloading costs were $11 million, $12 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. I&M recorded the cost of transloading services in Fuel on the balance sheets.\nCook Coal Terminal also performs railcar maintenance services at cost for I&M, PSO and SWEPCo. The railcar maintenance costs were as follows:\nI&M, PSO and SWEPCo recorded the cost of the railcar maintenance services in Fuel on the balance sheets.\nI&M Barging, Urea Transloading and Other Services (Applies to APCo and I&M)\nI&M provides barging, urea transloading and other transportation services to affiliates. Urea is a chemical used to control NOx emissions at certain generation plants in the AEP System. I&M recorded revenues from barging, transloading and other services in Other Revenues - Affiliated on the statements of income. The affiliated companies recorded these costs paid to I&M as fuel expenses or other operation expenses. The amounts of affiliated expenses were:\nCentral Machine Shop (Applies to APCo, I&M, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo)\nAPCo operates a facility which repairs and rebuilds specialized components for the generation plants across the AEP System. APCo defers the cost of performing these services on the balance sheet and then transfers the cost to the affiliate for reimbursement. The AEP subsidiaries recorded these billings as capital or maintenance expenses depending on the nature of the services received. These billings are recoverable from customers. The following table provides the amounts billed by APCo to the following affiliates:\nSales and Purchases of Property\nCertain AEP subsidiaries had affiliated sales and purchases of electric property individually amounting to $100 thousand or more, sales and purchases of meters and transformers, and sales and purchases of transmission property. There were no gains or losses recorded on the transactions. The following tables show the sales and purchases, recorded at net book value:\nSales\nPurchases\nThe amounts above are recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets.\nSempra Renewables LLC PPAs (Applies to I&M, OPCo and SWEPCo)\nIn April 2019, AEP acquired Sempra Renewables LLC and its ownership interests in 724 MWs of wind generation. The operating wind generation portfolio includes seven wind farms. Prior to the acquisition, two wind farms had existing PPAs with I&M, OPCo and SWEPCo. One of the joint venture wind farms has PPAs with I&M and OPCo for a portion of its energy production. The I&M portion totaled $10 million, $11 million and $9 million and the OPCo portion totaled $20 million, $23 million and $17 million respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

See \u201cAcquisitions\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nIntercompany Billings\nThe Registrant Subsidiaries and other AEP subsidiaries perform certain utility services for each other when necessary or practical. The costs of these services are billed on a direct-charge basis, whenever possible, or on reasonable basis of proration for services that benefit multiple companies. The billings for services are made at cost and include no compensation for the use of equity capital.\nCharitable Contributions to AEP Foundation\nThe American Electric Power Foundation is funded by American Electric Power and its utility operating units. The Foundation provides a permanent, ongoing resource for charitable initiatives and multi-year commitments in the communities served by AEP and initiatives outside of AEP\u2019s 11-state service area. Charitable contributions to the AEP Foundation were recorded in Other Operation on the statements of income. In 2021 and 2020, there were no charitable contributions made to the AEP Foundation. The charitable contributions to the AEP Foundation recorded in 2019 were as follows:\nOKTCo Radial Assets Transfer (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo and PSO)\nIn August 2020, AEPSC filed a request with FERC, on behalf of PSO and OKTCo, to transfer OKTCo\u2019s interests in its radial assets to PSO. OKTCo had previously constructed radial assets in the PSO service territory and after the radial assets were placed into service, management determined the radial assets were not eligible to be included as part of OKTCo\u2019s SPP OATT formula rates. In October 2020, FERC approved the request and in December 2020, OKTCo completed the transfer of its interest in the radial assets to PSO, through Parent, at net book value. At the transfer date, the net book value of the radial assets were $60 million, before associated tax liabilities.\n17. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe accounting guidance for \u201cVariable Interest Entities\u201d is a consolidation model that considers if a company has a variable interest in a VIE. A VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following conditions: the entity\u2019s equity at risk is not sufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, equity owners are unable to direct the activities that most significantly impact the legal entity\u2019s economic performance (or they possess disproportionate voting rights in relation to the economic interest in the legal entity), or the equity owners lack the obligation to absorb the legal entity\u2019s expected losses or the right to receive the legal entity\u2019s expected residual returns. Entities are required to consolidate a VIE when it is determined that they have a controlling financial interest in a VIE and therefore, are the primary beneficiary of that VIE, as defined by the accounting guidance for \u201cVariable Interest Entities.\u201d In determining whether AEP is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management considers whether AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and is obligated to absorb losses or receive the expected residual returns that are significant to the VIE. Management believes that significant assumptions and judgments were applied consistently.\nAEP holds ownership interests in businesses with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE, and if so, whether or not the VIE should be consolidated into AEP\u2019s financial statements. AEP has not provided material financial or other support that was not previously contractually required to any of its consolidated VIEs. If an entity is determined not to be a VIE, or if the entity is determined to be a VIE and AEP is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the entity is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nConsolidated Variable Interests Entities\nSabine (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nSabine is a mining operator providing mining services to SWEPCo. SWEPCo has no equity investment in Sabine but is Sabine\u2019s only customer. SWEPCo guarantees the debt obligations and lease obligations of Sabine. Under the terms of the note agreements, substantially all assets are pledged and all rights under the lignite mining agreement are assigned to SWEPCo. The creditors of Sabine have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo. Under the provisions of the mining agreement, SWEPCo is required to pay, as a part of the cost of lignite delivered, an amount equal to mining costs plus a management fee. In addition, SWEPCo determines how much coal will be mined each year. Based on these facts, management concluded that SWEPCo is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate Sabine. SWEPCo\u2019s total billings from Sabine for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $162 million, $131 million and $110 million, respectively. See the tables below for the classification of Sabine\u2019s assets and liabilities on SWEPCo\u2019s balance sheets.\nAs part of the process to receive a renewal of a Texas Railroad Commission permit for lignite mining, SWEPCo provides guarantees of mine reclamation of $155 million. Since SWEPCo uses self-bonding, the guarantee commits SWEPCo to complete the reclamation, in the event, Sabine does not complete the work. This guarantee ends upon completion of reclamation. The mine end-of-life has been adjusted to March 2023, in order to align with the announced closure of the Pirkey Power Plant. Reclamation is expected to be complete by 2037 at an estimated cost of $104 million. Actual reclamation costs could vary due to inflation and scope changes to the mine reclamation. SWEPCo recovers these costs through its fuel clauses. As of December 31, 2021, SWEPCo has recorded $94 million of mine reclamation costs in Asset Retirement Obligations and has collected $85 million through a rider for reclamation costs. The remaining $10 million is recorded in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on SWEPCo\u2019s balance sheets.\nDCC Fuel (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nI&M has nuclear fuel lease agreements with DCC Fuel, which was formed for the purpose of acquiring, owning and leasing nuclear fuel to I&M. DCC Fuel purchased the nuclear fuel from I&M with funds received from the issuance of notes to financial institutions. Each DCC Fuel entity is a single-lessee leasing arrangement with only one asset and is capitalized with all debt. Each is a separate legal entity from I&M, the assets of which are not available to satisfy the debts of I&M. Payments on the leases for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $91 million, $94 million and $95 million, respectively. The leases were recorded as finance leases on I&M\u2019s balance sheets as title to the nuclear fuel transfers to I&M at the end of the respective lease terms, which do not exceed 54 months. Based on I&M\u2019s control of DCC Fuel, management concluded that I&M is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate DCC Fuel. The finance leases are eliminated upon consolidation. See the tables below for the classification of DCC Fuel\u2019s assets and liabilities on I&M\u2019s balance sheets.\nTransition Funding (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nTransition Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to Texas Restructuring Legislation. Management has concluded that AEP Texas is the primary beneficiary of Transition Funding because AEP Texas has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and AEP Texas\u2019 equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, AEP Texas is required to consolidate Transition Funding. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $68 million and $66 million of the securitized bonds were included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated, respectively, and $141 million and $209 million were included in Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated, respectively, on the balance sheets. Transition Funding has securitized transition assets of $184 million and $242 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets. The securitized transition assets represent the right to impose and collect Texas true-up costs from customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from AEP Texas under-recovery mechanisms approved by the PUCT. The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized transition assets. The bondholders have no recourse to AEP Texas or any other AEP entity. AEP Texas acts as the servicer for Transition Funding\u2019s securitized transition assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Transition Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs. See the tables below for the classification of Transition Funding\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nRestoration Funding (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nRestoration Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to storm restoration of AEP Texas\u2019 distribution system primarily due to damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. Management has concluded that AEP Texas is the primary beneficiary of Restoration Funding because AEP Texas has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and AEP Texas\u2019 equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, AEP Texas is required to consolidate Restoration Funding. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $23 million and $23 million of the securitized bonds were included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated, respectively, and $173 million and $195 million were included in Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated, respectively, on the balance sheets. Restoration Funding has securitized assets of $183 million and $205 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets. The securitized restoration assets represent the right to impose and collect Texas storm restoration costs from customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from AEP Texas under-recovery mechanisms approved by the PUCT. The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets. The bondholders have no recourse to AEP Texas or any other AEP entity. AEP Texas acts as the servicer for Restoration Funding\u2019s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Restoration Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs. See the table below for the classification of Restoration Funding\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nAppalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nAppalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to APCo\u2019s under-recovered ENEC deferral balance. Management has concluded that APCo is the primary beneficiary of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding because APCo has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and APCo\u2019s equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, APCo is required to consolidate Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $26 million and $25 million of the securitized bonds were included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated, respectively, and $173 million and $199 million were included in Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated, respectively, on the balance sheets. Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding has securitized assets of $185 million and $210 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets. The phase-in recovery property represents the right to impose and collect West Virginia deferred generation charges from customers receiving electric transmission, distribution and generation service from APCo under a recovery mechanism approved by the WVPSC. In November 2013, securitization bonds were issued. The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets. The bondholders have no recourse to APCo or any other AEP entity. APCo acts as the servicer for Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding\u2019s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs. See the tables below for the classification of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding\u2019s assets and liabilities on APCo\u2019s balance sheets.\nAEP Credit (Applies to AEP)\nAEP Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. AEP Credit purchases, without recourse, accounts receivable from certain utility subsidiaries of AEP to reduce working capital requirements. AEP provides a minimum of 5% equity and up to 25% of AEP Credit\u2019s short-term borrowing needs in excess of third-party financings. Any third-party financing of AEP Credit only has recourse to the receivables securitized for such financing. Based on AEP\u2019s control of AEP Credit, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate AEP Credit. See the tables below for the classification of AEP Credit\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets. See \u201cSecuritized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit\u201d section of Note 14.\nEIS (Applies to AEP)\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries participate in one protected cell of EIS for six lines of insurance. EIS has multiple protected cells. Neither AEP nor its subsidiaries have an equity investment in EIS. The AEP System is essentially this EIS cell\u2019s only participant, but allows certain third-parties access to this insurance. AEP\u2019s subsidiaries and any allowed third-parties share in the insurance coverage, premiums and risk of loss from claims. Based on AEP\u2019s control and the structure of the protected cell of EIS, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary of the protected cell and is required to consolidate the protected cell of EIS. The insurance premium expense to the protected cell for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $30 million, $31 million and $34 million, respectively. See the tables below for the classification of the protected cell\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets. The amount reported as equity is the protected cell\u2019s policy holders\u2019 surplus.\nTransource Energy (Applies to AEP)\nTransource Energy was formed for the purpose of investing in utilities which develop, acquire, construct, own and operate transmission facilities in accordance with FERC-approved rates. AEP has equity and voting ownership of 86.5% with the other owner having 13.5% interest. Management has concluded that Transource Energy is a VIE and that AEP is the primary beneficiary because AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity and AEP\u2019s equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, AEP is required to consolidate Transource Energy. Transource Energy\u2019s activities consist of the development, construction and operation of FERC-regulated transmission assets in Missouri, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Oklahoma. Transource Energy has a credit facility agreement where borrowings are loaned through intercompany lending agreements to its subsidiaries. The creditor to the agreement has no recourse to the general credit of AEP. Transource Energy\u2019s credit facility agreement contains certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%. See the tables below for the classification of Transource Energy\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nApple Blossom Wind Holdings LLC and Black Oak Getty Wind Holdings LLC (Applies to AEP)\nIn April 2019, AEP acquired an equity interest in Apple Blossom Wind Holdings LLC (Apple Blossom) and Black Oak Getty Wind Holdings LLC (Black Oak) (collectively the Project Entities) as part of the purchase of Sempra Renewables LLC. Both of the Project Entities have long-term PPAs for 100% of their energy production. The Project Entities are tax equity partnerships with nonaffiliated noncontrolling interests to which a percentage of earnings, tax attributes and cash flows are allocated in accordance with the respective limited liability company agreements. Management has concluded that the Project Entities are VIEs and that AEP is the primary beneficiary based on its power as managing member to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Project Entities\u2019 economic performance. In addition, AEP has not provided material financial or other support to the Project Entities that was not previously contractually required. As the primary beneficiary of the Project Entities, AEP consolidates the Project Entities into its financial statements. See the table below for the classification of Project Entities\u2019 assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nThe nonaffiliated interests in the Project Entities is presented in Noncontrolling Interests on the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, AEP recorded $108 million and $119 million, respectively, of Noncontrolling Interests related to the Project Entities in Equity on the balance sheets.\nThe Project Entities\u2019 tax equity partnerships represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. The method for attributing income and loss to the noncontrolling interests is a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value (HLBV) method. Under the HLBV method, the income and loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests reflect changes in the amounts the members would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the respective limited liability company agreements, assuming the net assets of these entities were liquidated at recorded amounts, after taking into account any capital transactions, such as contributions or distributions, between the entities and the members. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the HLBV method resulted in a loss of $7 million and $6 million, respectively, allocated to Noncontrolling Interests.\nSanta Rita East (Applies to AEP)\nIn July 2019, AEP acquired a 75% interest in Santa Rita East Wind Energy Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Santa Rita East Wind Energy, LLC (collectively, Santa Rita East). In November 2020, AEP acquired an additional 10% interest in Santa Rita East resulting in AEP having a total interest of 85%. Santa Rita East is a partnership whose sole purpose is to own and operate a 302 MW wind generation facility in west Texas. Santa Rita East delivers energy and provides renewable energy credits through three long-term PPAs totaling 260 MWs. The remaining 42 MWs of energy are sold at wholesale into ERCOT. Management has concluded that Santa Rita East is a VIE and that AEP is the primary beneficiary based on its power as managing member of the partnership to direct the activities that most significantly impact Santa Rita East\u2019s economic performance. As the primary beneficiary of Santa Rita East, AEP consolidates Santa Rita East into its financial statements. See the tables below for the classification of Santa Rita East\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nAEP recognized $25 million and $23 million of PTC attributable to Santa Rita East for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was recorded in Income Tax Expense (Benefit) on the statements of income. The nonaffiliated interest in Santa Rita East is presented in Noncontrolling Interests on the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, AEP recorded $59 million and $61 million, respectively, of Noncontrolling Interests related to Santa Rita East in Equity on the balance sheets.\nDry Lake (Applies to AEP)\nIn November 2020, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement with a nonaffiliate to acquire a 75% ownership interest in the entity that owns Dry Lake Solar Project (collectively, Dry Lake). Dry Lake is a partnership whose sole purpose is to own, operate and maintain a 100 MW solar generation facility in southern Nevada. In March 2021, AEP closed the transaction and the solar project was placed in-service in May 2021. Dry Lake delivers energy and provides renewable energy credits through a long-term PPA. Management has concluded that Dry Lake is a VIE and that AEP is the primary beneficiary based on its power as managing member to direct the activities that most significantly impact Dry Lake\u2019s economic performance. As the primary beneficiary of Dry Lake, AEP consolidates Dry Lake into its financial statements. See the table below for the classification of Dry Lake assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nAEP recognized $33 million of ITC attributable to Dry Lake for the year ended December 31, 2021 which was recorded in Income Tax Expense (Benefit) on the statements of income. The nonaffiliated interest in Dry Lake is presented in Noncontrolling Interests on the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021, AEP recognized $35 million of Noncontrolling Interest on the balance sheets.\nThe balances below represent the assets and liabilities of the VIEs that are consolidated. These balances include intercompany transactions that are eliminated upon consolidation.\n(a)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $24 million.\n(b)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $8 million.\n(c)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $2 million.\n(a)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $32 million.\n(b)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $9 million.\n(c)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $3 million.\nNon-Consolidated Significant Variable Interests\nDHLC (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nDHLC is a mining operator which sells 50% of the lignite produced to SWEPCo and 50% to CLECO. The operations of DHLC are governed by the lignite mining agreement among SWEPCo, CLECO and DHLC. SWEPCo and CLECO share the executive board seats and voting rights equally. In accordance with the lignite mining agreement, each entity is responsible for 50% of DHLC\u2019s obligations, including debt. SWEPCo and CLECO equally approve DHLC\u2019s annual budget. The creditors of DHLC have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo. As SWEPCo is the sole equity owner of DHLC, it receives 100% of the management fee. SWEPCo\u2019s total billings from DHLC for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $47 million, $142 million and $55 million, respectively. SWEPCo is not required to consolidate DHLC as it is not the primary beneficiary, although SWEPCo holds a significant variable interest in DHLC. SWEPCo\u2019s equity investment in DHLC is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on SWEPCo\u2019s balance sheets.\nSWEPCo\u2019s investment in DHLC was:\nOVEC (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nAEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC. As of December 31, 2021, AEP\u2019s ownership in OVEC was 43.47%. Parent owns 39.17% and OPCo owns 4.3%. APCo, I&M and OPCo are members to an intercompany power agreement. The Registrants\u2019 power participation ratios are 15.69% for APCo, 7.85% for I&M and 19.93% for OPCo. Participants of this agreement are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC generating capacity, approximately 2,400 MWs, in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs, including outstanding indebtedness, and provide a return on capital. The intercompany power agreement ends in June 2040.\nAEP and other nonaffiliated owners authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests. OVEC financed capital expenditures in connection with the engineering and construction of FGD projects and the associated waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants. These environmental projects were funded through debt issuances. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, OVEC\u2019s outstanding indebtedness was approximately $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, the Registrants\u2019 are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC\u2019s outstanding debt through the intercompany power agreement. Principal and interest payments related to OVEC\u2019s outstanding indebtedness are disclosed in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cCommitments.\u201d See the \u201cCommitments\u201d section of Note 6 for additional information.\nAEP is not required to consolidate OVEC as it is not the primary beneficiary, although AEP and its subsidiary holds a significant variable interest in OVEC. Power to control decision making that significantly impacts the economic performance of OVEC is shared amongst the owners through their representation on the Board of Directors of OVEC and the representation of the sponsoring companies on the Operating Committee under the intercompany power agreement.\nAEP\u2019s investment in OVEC was:\n(a)Based on the Registrants\u2019 power participation ratios APCo, I&M and OPCo\u2019s share of OVEC debt was $177 million, $89 million and $226 million as of December 31, 2021 and $200 million, $100 million and $255 million as of December 31, 2020, respectively.\nPower purchased by the Registrant Subsidiaries from OVEC is included in Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income and is shown in the table below:\nAEPSC (Applies to AEP)\nAEPSC provides certain managerial and professional services to AEP\u2019s subsidiaries. Parent is the sole equity owner of AEPSC. AEP management controls the activities of AEPSC. The costs of the services are based on a direct-charge or on a prorated basis and billed to the AEP subsidiary companies at AEPSC\u2019s cost. AEP subsidiaries have not provided financial or other support outside of the reimbursement of costs for services rendered. AEPSC finances its operations through cost reimbursement from other AEP subsidiaries. There are no other terms or arrangements between AEPSC and any of the AEP subsidiaries that could require additional financial support from an AEP subsidiary or expose them to losses outside of the normal course of business. AEPSC and its billings are subject to regulation by the FERC. AEP subsidiaries are exposed to losses to the extent they cannot recover the costs of AEPSC through their normal business operations. AEP subsidiaries are considered to have a significant interest in AEPSC due to their activity in AEPSC\u2019s cost reimbursement structure. However, AEP subsidiaries do not have control over AEPSC. AEPSC is consolidated by AEP. In the event AEPSC would require financing or other support outside the cost reimbursement billings, this financing would be provided by AEP.\nTotal AEPSC billings to the Registrant Subsidiaries were as follows:\nThe carrying amount and classification of variable interest in AEPSC\u2019s accounts payable were as follows:\nAEGCo (Applies to AEP)\nAEGCo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, is consolidated by AEP. AEGCo owns a 50% ownership interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 1 and leases a 50% interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 2. AEGCo sells all the output from the Rockport Plant to I&M and KPCo. AEP has agreed to provide AEGCo with the funds necessary to satisfy all of the debt obligations of AEGCo. I&M is considered to have a significant interest in AEGCo due to these transactions. I&M is exposed to losses to the extent it cannot recover the costs of AEGCo through its normal business operations. In the event AEGCo would require financing or other support outside the billings to I&M and KPCo, this financing would be provided by AEP. Total billings to I&M from AEGCo for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $218 million, $173 million and $215 million, respectively. The carrying amounts of I&M\u2019s liabilities associated with AEGCo as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $18 million and $9 million, respectively. Management estimates the maximum exposure of loss to be equal to the amount of such liability. See \u201cRockport Lease\u201d section of Note 13 for additional information.\nSignificant Equity Method Investments in Unconsolidated Entities (Applies to AEP)\nFor a discussion of the equity method of accounting, see the \u201cEquity Investment in Unconsolidated Entities\u201d section of Note 1.\nSempra Renewables LLC\nIn April 2019, AEP acquired a 50% interest in five wind farms in multiple states as part of the purchase of Sempra Renewables LLC. The wind farms are joint ventures with BP Wind Energy who holds the other 50% interest. All five wind farms have long-term PPAs for 100% of their energy production. One of the jointly-owned wind farms has PPAs with I&M and OPCo for a portion of its energy production. Another jointly-owned wind farm has a PPA with SWEPCo for a portion of its energy production. The joint venture wind farms are not considered VIEs and AEP is not required to consolidate them as AEP does not have a controlling financial interest. However, AEP is able to exercise significant influence over the wind farms and therefore applies the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, AEP\u2019s carrying value of the investment in the five joint venture wind farms was $399 million and $376 million, respectively. The difference between AEP\u2019s carrying value and the amount of underlying equity in net assets is immaterial. The investment includes amounts recognized in AOCI related to interest rate cash flow hedges. AEP\u2019s equity earnings associated with the five joint venture wind farms was a loss of $12 million and earnings of $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. AEP recognized $33 million and $36 million of PTC attributable to the joint venture wind farms for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was recorded in Income Tax Expense (Benefit) on the statements of income.\nETT\nETT designs, acquires, constructs, owns and operates certain transmission facilities in ERCOT. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a nonaffiliated entity, holds a 50% membership interest in ETT and AEP Transmission Holdco holds a 50% membership interest in ETT. As a result, AEP, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, holds a 50% membership interest in ETT. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, AEP\u2019s investment in ETT was $733 million and $732 million, respectively. AEP\u2019s equity earnings associated with ETT were $66 million, $68 million and $66 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n18. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment is shown functionally on the face of the balance sheets. The following tables include the total plant balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(a)AEP and SWEPCo\u2019s regulated generation and regulated CWIP include amounts related to SWEPCo\u2019s Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant.\n(b)Amount excludes $2.3 billion and $165 million for AEP and AEPTCo, respectively, of Property, Plant and Equipment - Net classified as Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nThe Registrants provide for depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment, excluding coal-mining properties, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, generally using composite rates by functional class. The following tables provide total regulated annual composite depreciation rates and depreciable lives for the Registrants:\nAEPTCo\n2021 2020 2019\nFunctional Class of Property Annual Composite\nDepreciation Rate Depreciable\nLife Ranges Annual Composite\nDepreciation Rate Depreciable\nLife Ranges Annual Composite\nDepreciation Rate Depreciable\nLife Ranges\n(in years) (in years) (in years)\nTransmission 2.5% 24 - 75 2.4% 24 - 75 2.0% 24 - 75\nOther 6.7% 5 - 56 6.3% 5 - 64 5.8% 5 - 64\nThe following table includes the nonregulated annual composite depreciation rate ranges and nonregulated depreciable life ranges for AEP. Depreciation rate ranges and depreciable life ranges are not meaningful for nonregulated property of AEP Texas, AEPTCo, APCo, I&M, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo for 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n(a)In 2020 management announced plans to retire the Pirkey Plant in 2023 and the related depreciable lives have been adjusted accordingly. See Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for additional information.\nNA Not applicable.\nSWEPCo provides for depreciation, depletion and amortization of coal-mining assets over each asset\u2019s estimated useful life or the estimated life of each mine, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method for mining structures and equipment. SWEPCo uses either the straight-line method or the units-of-production method to amortize mine development costs and deplete coal rights based on estimated recoverable tonnages. SWEPCo includes these costs in fuel expense.\nFor regulated operations, the composite depreciation rate generally includes a component for non-ARO removal costs, which is credited to Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization on the balance sheets. Actual removal costs incurred are charged to Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization. Any excess of accrued non-ARO removal costs over actual removal costs incurred is reclassified from Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization and reflected as a regulatory liability. For nonregulated operations, non-ARO removal costs are expensed as incurred.\nAsset Retirement Obligations (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants record ARO in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cAsset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\u201d for legal obligations for asbestos removal and for the retirement of certain ash disposal facilities, wind farms, solar farms and certain coal-mining facilities. I&M records ARO for the decommissioning of the Cook Plant. The Registrants have identified, but not recognized, ARO liabilities related to electric transmission and distribution assets as a result of certain easements on property on which assets are owned. Generally, such easements are perpetual and require only the retirement and removal of assets upon the cessation of the property\u2019s use. The retirement obligation is not estimable for such easements since the Registrants plan to use their facilities indefinitely. The retirement obligation would only be recognized if and when the Registrants abandon or cease the use of specific easements, which is not expected.\nThe Registrants recorded the following revisions to ARO estimates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, I&M\u2019s ARO liability for nuclear decommissioning of the Cook Plant was $1.93 billion and $1.80 billion, respectively. These liabilities are reflected in Asset Retirement Obligations on I&M\u2019s balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of I&M\u2019s assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling decommissioning liabilities totaled $3.54 billion and $2.98 billion, respectively. These assets are included in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on I&M\u2019s balance sheets. In December 2021, I&M recorded a $58 million revision for Cook Plant as a result of the latest decommissioning cost study. The ARO liability was updated and changes from the previous study were driven primarily by general increases in the projected cost of labor and materials.\n\u2022In 2020, Virginia\u2019s Governor signed House Bill 443 (HB 443) requiring APCo to close certain ash disposal units at the retired Glen Lyn Station by removal of all coal combustion material. In June 2020, APCo recorded a revision to increase estimated Glen Lyn Station ash disposal ARO liabilities by $199 million due to the enactment of HB 443. In June 2021, management completed fully designed and costed project plans for the Glen Lyn Station site and increased ash disposal ARO liabilities by an additional $79 million. HB 443 provides for the recovery of all costs associated with closure by removal through the Virginia environmental rate adjustment clause. APCo is permitted to record carrying costs on the unrecovered balance of closure costs as a weighted-average cost of capital approved by the Virginia SCC. The legislation provides for regulatory recovery of these costs.\n\u2022In 2020, SWEPCo recorded a revision to increase estimated ARO liabilities by $21 million primarily due to the revision in the useful life of DHLC. See Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for additional information. In September 2020, SWEPCo recorded an $18 million revision due to a reduction in estimated ash pond closure costs.\n\u2022In 2020, AEP Texas and PSO recorded a revision to decrease estimated ARO liabilities by $17 million and $5 million, respectively, due to the retirement of the Oklaunion Power Station in September 2020. See \u201cOklaunion Power Station\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n\u2022In 2020, AGR derecognized $106 million of Conesville Plant related ARO liabilities as a result of the Environmental Liability and Property Transfer and Asset Purchase Agreement executed with a non-affiliated third-party. See \u201cConesville Plant\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the 2021 and 2020 aggregate carrying amounts of ARO by Registrant:\n(a)Unless discussed above, primarily related to ash ponds, landfills and mine reclamation, generally due to changes in estimated closure area, volumes and/or unit costs.\n(b)Includes ARO related to ash disposal facilities.\n(c)Includes ARO related to nuclear decommissioning costs for the Cook Plant of $1.93 billion and $1.80 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(d)Includes ARO related to Sabine and DHLC.\n(e)Includes ARO related to asbestos removal.\n(f)Includes $18 million of ARO classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet. See \u201cDisposition of KPCo and KTCo\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalization\nThe Registrants\u2019 amounts of Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction are summarized in the following table:\nThe Registrants\u2019 amounts of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, including capitalized interest, are summarized in the following table:\nJointly-owned Electric Facilities (Applies to AEP, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nThe Registrants have electric facilities that are jointly-owned with affiliated and nonaffiliated companies. Using its own financing, each participating company is obligated to pay its share of the costs of these jointly-owned facilities in the same proportion as its ownership interest. Each Registrant\u2019s proportionate share of the operating costs associated with these facilities is included in its statements of income and the investments and accumulated depreciation are reflected in its balance sheets under Property, Plant and Equipment as follows:\n(a)Operated by CLECO, a nonaffiliated company. The Dolet Hills Power Station was retired in December 2021.\n(b)Operated by SWEPCo.\n(c)Operated by I&M.\n(d)Amounts include I&M\u2019s 50% ownership of both Unit 1 and capital additions for Unit 2. Unit 2 is subject to a finance lease with a nonaffiliated company. See the \u201cRockport Lease\u201d section of Note 13 for additional information.\n(e)AEGCo owns 50% of Unit 1 with I&M and 50% of capital additions for Unit 2.\n(f)PSO and SWEPCo own undivided interests of 45.5% and 54.5% of the NCWF, respectively. Sundance was placed into service in April 2021. Maverick was placed into service in September 2021. See the \u201cAcquisitions\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n(g)Operated by PSO.\n19.

A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to a customer. The invoice practical expedient within the accounting guidance for \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d allows for the recognition of revenue from performance obligations in the amount of consideration to which there is a right to invoice the customer and when the amount for which there is a right to invoice corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\nThe purpose of the invoice practical expedient is to depict an entity\u2019s measure of progress toward completion of the performance obligation within a contract and can only be applied to performance obligations that are satisfied over time and when the invoice is representative of services provided to date. AEP subsidiaries elected to apply the invoice practical expedient to recognize revenue for performance obligations satisfied over time as the invoices from the respective revenue streams are representative of services or goods provided to date to the customer. Performance obligations for AEP\u2019s subsidiaries are summarized as follows:\nRetail Revenues\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution Utilities segments have performance obligations to generate, transmit and distribute electricity for sale to rate-regulated retail customers. The performance obligation to deliver electricity is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. Revenues are variable as they are subject to the customer\u2019s usage requirements.\nRate-regulated retail customers typically have the right to discontinue receiving service at will, therefore these contracts between AEP\u2019s subsidiaries and their customers for rate-regulated services are generally limited to the services requested and received to date for such arrangements. Retail customers are generally billed on a monthly basis, and payment is typically due within 15 to 20 days after the issuance of the invoice. Payments from REPs are due to AEP Texas within 35 days.\nWholesale Revenues - Generation\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Generation & Marketing segments have performance obligations to sell electricity to wholesale customers from generation assets in PJM, SPP and ERCOT. The performance obligation to deliver electricity from generation assets is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. Wholesale generation revenues are variable as they are subject to the customer\u2019s usage requirements.\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Generation & Marketing segments also have performance obligations to stand ready in order to promote grid reliability. Stand ready services are sold into PJM\u2019s RPM capacity market. RPM entails a base auction and at least three incremental auctions for a specific PJM delivery year, with the incremental auctions spanning three years. The performance obligation to stand ready is satisfied over time and the consideration for which is variable until the occurrence of the final incremental auction, at which point the performance obligation becomes fixed.\nPayments from the RTO for stand ready services are typically received within one week from the issuance of the invoice, which is typically issued weekly. Gross margin resulting from generation sales within the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment are primarily subject to margin sharing agreements with customers and vary by state, where the revenues are reflected gross in the disaggregated revenues tables above.\nAPCo has a performance obligation to supply wholesale electricity to KGPCo through a PPA. The FERC regulates the cost-based wholesale power transactions between APCo and KGPCo. The purchased power agreement includes a component for the recovery of transmission costs under the FERC OATT. The transmission cost component of purchased power is cost-based and regulated by the Tennessee Regulatory Authority. APCo\u2019s performance obligation under the purchased power agreement is satisfied over time as KGPCo simultaneously receives and consumes the wholesale electricity. APCo\u2019s revenues from the purchased power agreement are presented within the Generation Revenues line in the disaggregated revenues tables above.\nWholesale Revenues - Transmission\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities, Transmission and Distribution Utilities and AEP Transmission Holdco segments have performance obligations to transmit electricity to wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP subsidiaries. The performance obligation to provide transmission services in PJM, SPP and ERCOT encompass a time frame greater than a year, where the performance obligation within each RTO is partially fixed for a period of one year or less. Payments from the RTO for transmission services are typically received within one week from the issuance of the invoice, which is issued monthly for SPP and ERCOT and weekly for PJM.\nAEP subsidiaries within the PJM and SPP regions collect revenues through transmission formula rates. The FERC-approved rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners. The formula rates establish rates for a one year period and also include a true-up calculation for the prior year\u2019s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner\u2019s ATRR. The annual true-ups meet the definition of alternative revenues in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations,\u201d and are therefore presented as such in the disaggregated revenues tables above. AEP subsidiaries within the ERCOT region collect revenues through a combination of base rates and interim Transmission Costs of Services filings that are approved by the PUCT.\nThe AEP East Companies are parties to the TA, which defines how transmission costs are allocated among the AEP East Companies on a 12-month average coincident peak basis. PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA by and among PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC, in connection with the operation of the transmission assets of the two AEP utility subsidiaries. AEPTCo is a transmission owner within the PJM and SPP regions providing transmission services to affiliates in accordance with the OATT, TA and TCA. Affiliate revenues as a result of the respective TA and the TCA are reflected as Transmission Revenues in the disaggregated revenues tables above.\nMarketing, Competitive Retail and Renewable Revenues\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Generation & Marketing segment have performance obligations to deliver electricity to competitive retail and wholesale customers. Performance obligations for marketing, competitive retail and renewable offtake sales are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. Revenues are primarily variable as they are subject to customer\u2019s usage requirements; however, certain contracts mandate a delivery of a set quantity of electricity at a predetermined price, resulting in a fixed performance obligation.\nPayment terms under marketing arrangements typically follow standard Edison Electric Institute and International Swaps and Derivatives Association terms, which call for payment in 20 days. Payments for competitive retail and offtake arrangements for renewable assets range from 15 to 60 days and are dependent on the product sold, location and the creditworthiness of customer. Invoices for marketing arrangements, competitive retail and offtake arrangements for renewable assets are issued monthly.\nFixed Performance Obligations\nThe following table represents the Registrants\u2019 remaining fixed performance obligations satisfied over time as of December 31, 2021. Fixed performance obligations primarily include wholesale transmission services, electricity sales for fixed amounts of energy and stand ready services into PJM\u2019s RPM market. The Registrant Subsidiaries amounts shown in the table below include affiliated and nonaffiliated revenues.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets are recognized when the Registrants have a right to consideration that is conditional upon the occurrence of an event other than the passage of time, such as future performance under a contract. The Registrants did not have any material contract assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nWhen the Registrants receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract, they recognize a contract liability on the balance sheet in the amount of that consideration. Revenue for such consideration is subsequently recognized in the period or periods in which the remaining performance obligations in the contract are satisfied. The Registrants\u2019 contract liabilities typically arise from services provided under joint use agreements for utility poles. The Registrants did not have any material contract liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAccounts Receivable from Contracts with Customers\nAccounts receivable from contracts with customers are presented on the Registrants\u2019 balance sheets within the Accounts Receivable - Customers line item. The Registrants\u2019 balances for receivables from contracts that are not recognized in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d included in Accounts Receivable - Customers were not material as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. See \u201cSecuritized Accounts Receivable - AEP Credit\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information.\nThe following table represents the amount of affiliated accounts receivable from contracts with customers included in Accounts Receivable - Affiliated Companies on the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets:\nContract Costs\nContract costs to obtain or fulfill a contract for AEP subsidiaries within the Generation & Marketing segment are accounted for under the guidance for \u201cOther Assets and Deferred Costs\u201d and presented as a single asset and are neither bifurcated nor reclassified between current and noncurrent assets on the Registrants\u2019 balance sheets. Contract costs to acquire a contract are amortized in a manner consistent with the transfer of goods or services to the customer in Other Operation on the Registrants\u2019 income statements. The Registrants did not have material contract costs as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n20. GOODWILL\nThe disclosure in this note applies to AEP only.\nThe changes in AEP\u2019s carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 by operating segment are as follows:\nIn the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, annual impairment tests were performed. The fair values of the reporting units with goodwill were estimated using cash flow projections and other market value indicators. There were no goodwill impairment losses. AEP does not have any accumulated impairment on existing goodwill.",
