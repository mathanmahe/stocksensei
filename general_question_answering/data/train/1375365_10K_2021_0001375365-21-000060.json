    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOur Company\nWe are a Silicon Valley-based provider of application-optimized high-performance and high-efficiency server and storage systems for various markets, including enterprise data centers, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 5G and edge computing. Our solutions include complete servers, storage systems, modular blade servers, blades, workstations, complete rack scale plug and play solutions delivering pre-defined and pre-tested full rack solutions, networking devices, system management software, and server sub-systems. We also provide global support and services to help our customers install, upgrade and maintain their computing infrastructure. We offer our customers a high degree of flexibility and customization by providing a broad array of server models and configurations from which they can choose the best solutions to fit their computing needs. Our server and storage systems, sub-systems and accessories are architecturally designed to provide high levels of reliability, quality, configurability, and scalability.\nOur in-house design competencies, design control of many of the components used within our server and storage systems, and our Server Building Block Solutions\u00ae (an innovative, modular and open architecture) enable us to rapidly develop, build and test server and storage systems, sub-systems and accessories with unique configurations. As a result, when new technologies are brought to market, we are generally able to quickly assemble a broad portfolio of solutions by leveraging common building blocks across product lines. We work closely with the leading microprocessor, graphics processing units (\u201cGPU\u201d), memory, disk/flash, and interconnect vendors and other hardware and software suppliers to coordinate our new products' design with their product release schedules. This enhances our ability to introduce new products incorporating the latest technology rapidly. We seek to be the first to market with products incorporating new technologies and to offer the broadest selection of products using those technologies to our customers.\nTo reduce the high cost of operating datacenters, IT managers increasingly turn to suppliers of high-performance products that are also cost-effective, energy-efficient, and green. Our resource saving architecture supports our efforts to lead in green IT innovation. This architecture disaggregates CPU and memory, which enables each resource to be refreshed independently, thereby allowing data centers to significantly reduce both refresh cycle costs and e-waste. In addition, we offer product lines that are designed to share common computing resources, thereby saving both valuable space and power as compared to general-purpose rackmount servers. We believe our approach of leveraging an overall architecture that balances data center power requirements, cooling, shared resources and refresh cycles helps the environment and provides total cost of ownership (\u201cTCO\u201d) savings for our customers.\nWe conduct our operations principally from our Silicon Valley headquarters in California and in our Taiwan and the Netherlands facilities. Our sales and marketing activities operate through a combination of our direct sales force and indirect\nsales channel partners. We work with distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, and original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") to market and sell our optimized solutions to their end customers in our indirect sales channels.\nStrategy\nOur objective is to be the world\u2019s leading provider of application-optimized, high-performance server, storage and networking solutions. Achieving this objective requires continuous development and innovation of our solutions with better price-performance and architectural advantages compared with our prior generation of solutions and with solutions offered by our competitors. Through our strategy, we seek to maintain or improve our relative competitive position in many product areas and pursue markets that provide us with additional long-term growth opportunities. Key elements of our strategy include executing upon the following:\nA Strong Internal Research and Development and Internal Manufacturing Capability\nWe are continually investing in our engineering organization. As of June 30, 2021, we employed over 1,800 persons in our research and development organization. These resources, along with our understanding of complex computing and storage requirements, enable us to deliver product innovation featuring advanced functionality and capabilities required by our customers. Also, substantially all of our servers are tested and assembled in our facilities, and more than half of our final server and storage production is completed in San Jose, California. Our engineering aptitude, coupled with our internal manufacturing capability, enables rapid prototyping and product roll-out, contributing to a high level of responsiveness to our customers.\nIntroducing More Innovative Products, Faster\nWe seek to sustain advantages in both time-to-market and breadth of products incorporating the latest technological innovations, such as new processors, advancements in storage and evolving I/O technologies. We seek these advantages by leveraging our in-house design capabilities and our Building Block Solutions \u00ae architecture. This allows us to offer customers a broad choice of products to match their target application requirements. For example, in early April 2021, we introduced over 100 new application optimized systems in support of Intel\u2019s introduction of its 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors. In March 2021, Supermicro announced one of the most versatile portfolio of AMD EPYC\u2122 7003-based systems delivering world record performance - 36% improvement -- for today\u2019s most critical workloads.\nCapitalizing on New Applications and Technologies\nIn addition to serving traditional needs for server and storage systems, we have devoted, and will continue to devote, substantial resources to developing systems that support emerging and growing applications including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 5G/edge computing, storage and others. We believe there are significant opportunities for us in each of these rapidly developing markets due to stringent design requirements for these applications that often require the use of the latest technologies, allowing us to leverage our capabilities in product innovation, superior time-to-market, and portfolio breadth.\nDriving Software and Services Sales to our Global Enterprise Customers\nWe seek to grow our global enterprise revenue by bolstering and expanding our software management products and support services. These software products and services are required for large scale deployments, help meet service level agreements and address uptime requirements. In addition to our internal software development efforts, we also integrate and partner with external software vendors to meet customer requirements.\nLeveraging Our Global Operating Structure\nWe plan to continue to increase our worldwide manufacturing capacity and logistics abilities in the United States, the Netherlands and Taiwan to more efficiently serve our customers and lower our overall manufacturing costs. We have recently completed the construction of a new 749,000 square feet building in Taiwan to increase our manufacturing capacity and diversify our operating base and optimize relatively low labor costs as compared to the United States. In addition, we have added a new building devoted to manufacturing at our San Jose, California headquarters.\nProducts and Services\nWe offer a broad range of application-optimized server solutions, rackmount and blade servers, storage, and subsystems and accessories, which can be used to build complete server and storage systems. These solutions and products are designed to serve a variety of markets, such as enterprise data centers, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d), 5G/edge computing. The percentage of our net sales represented by sales of server and storage systems was flat in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 and decreased to 78.5% in fiscal year 2020 from 81.7% in fiscal year 2019, and the percentage of our net sales represented by sales of subsystems and accessories was 21.6% in fiscal year 2021, 21.5% in fiscal year 2020 and 18.3% in fiscal year 2019. We complement our server and storage system offerings with software management solutions as well as global services and support, the revenue for which is included in our server and storage systems revenue.\nServer and Storage Systems\nWe sell server and storage systems in rackmount, blade, multi-node and embedded form factors, which support single, dual, and multiprocessor architectures. Our key product lines include:\n\u2022SuperBlade\u00ae and MicroBlade\u2122\u00ae system families designed to share common computing resources, thereby saving space and power over standard rackmount servers;\n\u2022SuperStorage systems that provide high-density storage while leveraging an efficient use of power to achieve performance-per-watt savings;\n\u2022Twin family of multi-node server systems designed for density, performance, and power efficiency;\n\u2022Ultra Server systems for demanding enterprise workloads;\n\u2022GPU or Accelerated systems for rapidly growing AI markets;\n\u2022Data Center Optimized server systems that deliver increased scalability and performance-per-watt with an improved thermal architecture;\n\u2022Embedded (5G/IoT/Edge) systems optimized for evolving networks and intelligent management of connected devices; and\n\u2022MicroCloud server systems that deliver node density in environments with space and power constraints.\nIn addition to our complete server and storage systems business, we offer a large array of modular server subsystems and accessories, such as server boards, chassis, power supplies and other accessories. These subsystems are the foundation of our server solutions and span product offerings from the entry-level single and dual-processor server segment to the high-end multiprocessor market. The majority of the subsystems and accessories we sell individually are designed to work together to improve performance, and are ultimately integrated into complete server and storage systems.\nServer Software Management Solutions\nOur open industry-standard remote system management solutions, such as our Server Management suite, including Supermicro Server Manager (\u201cSSM\u201d), Supermicro Power Management software (\u201cSPM\u201d), Supermicro Update Manager (\u201cSUM\u201d), and SuperDoctor 5, have been designed to help manage large-scale heterogeneous data center environments.\nSupermicro Global Services\nWe provide global service and support offerings for our direct and OEM customers and our indirect sales channel partners directly or through approved distributors and third-party partners. Our services include server and storage system integration, configuration and software upgrades and updates. We also identify service requirements, create and execute project plans, conduct verification testing and training and provide technical documentation.\nGlobal Services: Our strategic direct and OEM customers may purchase a variety of on-site support service plans.

Our Global Services team provides help desk services and on-site product support for our server and storage systems.\nSupport Services: Our customer support services offer competitive market warranties, generally from one-to-three years, and warranty extension options for products sold by our direct sales team and approved indirect sales channel partners. Our customer support team provides ongoing maintenance and technical support for our products through our website and 24-hour continuous direct phone-based support.\nResearch and Development\nWe perform most of our research and development activities in-house in the United States at our facilities in San Jose, California, and in Taiwan, increasing the communication and collaboration between design teams to streamline the development process and reduce time-to-market. We believe that the combination of our focus on internal research and development activities, our close working relationships with customers and vendors and our modular design approach allows us to decrease time-to-market. We continue to invest in reducing our design and manufacturing costs and improving the performance, cost-effectiveness and power- and space-efficiency of our solutions.\nOur research and development teams focus on the development of new and enhanced products that can support emerging technological and engineering innovations while achieving high overall system performance. Much of our research and development activity relates to the new product cycles of leading processor vendors. We work closely with Intel, Nvidia and AMD, among others, to develop products that are compatible with the latest generation of industry-standard technologies under development. Our collaborative approach with these vendors allows us to coordinate the design of our new products with their product release schedules, thereby enhancing our ability to rapidly introduce new products incorporating the latest technology. We work closely with their respective development teams to enhance system performance and reduce system-level issues. Similarly, we work very closely with our customers to identify their needs and develop our new product plans accordingly.\nCustomers\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we sold to over 1,000 direct customers in over 100 countries. During each of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we sold to over 820 and 850 direct customers respectively. In addition, over the three years ended June 30, 2021 we have sold to thousands of end users through our indirect sales channel. These customers represent a diverse set of market verticals including enterprise data centers, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 5G and edge computing markets. In fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, no customer represented greater than 10% of our total net sales.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing activities are conducted through a combination of our direct sales force and our indirect sales channel partners. Our direct sales force is primarily focused on selling complete systems and solutions, including management software and global services to large scale cloud, enterprise and OEM customers.\nWe work with distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, and OEMs to market and sell our optimized solutions to their end customers. We provide sales and marketing assistance and training to our indirect sales channel partners and OEMs, who in turn provide service and support to end customers. We leverage our relationships in our indirect sales channel and with our OEMs to penetrate select industry segments where our products can provide better alternatives to existing solutions.\nWe maintain close contact with our indirect sales channel partners and end customers. We often collaborate during the sales process with our indirect sales channel partners and the end customer\u2019s technical staff to help determine the optimal system configuration for the customer\u2019s needs. Our interaction with our indirect sales channel partners and end customers allows us to monitor customer requirements and develop new products to meet their needs.\nInternational Sales\nOur global sales efforts are supported both by our international offices in the Netherlands, Taiwan, United Kingdom, China and Japan as well as by our United States based sales team. Product fulfillment and first level support for our international customers are provided by Supermicro Global Services and through our indirect sales channel and OEMs. Sales to customers located outside of the United States represented 40.7%, 41.4% and 41.9% of net sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nMarketing\nOur marketing programs are designed to create a global awareness and branding for our company and products, as well as an understanding of the significant value we bring to customers. These programs also inform existing and potential customers, the trade press, market analysts, indirect sales channel partners and OEMs about the strong capabilities and benefits of using our products and solutions. Our marketing efforts support the sale and distribution of our products through both direct sales and indirect channels. We rely on a variety of marketing vehicles, including advertising, public relations, web, social media, participation in industry trade shows and conferences to help gain market acceptance. We provide funds for cooperative marketing to our indirect sales channel partners to extend the reach of our marketing efforts. We also actively utilize our suppliers\u2019 cooperative marketing programs and jointly benefit from their marketing development funds to which we are entitled.\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property rights with a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and disclosure restrictions. We rely primarily on trade secrets, technical know-how, and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our design and product development activities. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, and other third parties and control access to our designs, documentation and other proprietary information.\nManufacturing and Quality Control\nWe manufacture the majority of our systems at our San Jose, California headquarters. We believe we are the only major server and storage vendor that designs, develops, and manufactures a significant portion of their systems in the United States. Global assembly, test and quality control of our servers are performed at our manufacturing facilities in San Jose, California, Taiwan and the Netherlands. Each of our facilities Quality and Environmental Management System has been certified according to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and/or ISO 13485 standards. Our suppliers and contract manufacturers are required to support the same standards to maintain consistent product and service quality and continuous improvement of quality and environmental performance.\nWe use several third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers for materials and sub-assemblies. We believe that selectively using outsourced manufacturing services allows us to focus on our core competencies in product design and development and increases our operational flexibility. We believe our manufacturing strategy allows us to adjust manufacturing capacity in response to changes in customer demand and to rapidly introduce new products to the market. We use Ablecom Technology, Inc. (\u201cAblecom\u201d) and its affiliate Compuware Technology, Inc. (\"Compuware\"), both of which are related parties, for contract design and manufacturing coordination support. We work with Ablecom to optimize modular designs for our chassis and several other components. Ablecom also coordinates the manufacturing of chassis for us. In addition to providing a large volume of contract manufacturing services to us, Ablecom warehouses multiple components and subassemblies manufactured by various suppliers before shipment to our facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia. We also have a series of agreements with Compuware, including multiple product development, production and service agreements, product manufacturing agreements and lease agreements for office space. See Part II, Item 8, Note 13, \u201cRelated Party Transactions,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements and Part III, Item 13, \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.\u201d\nWe monitor our inventory continuously to be able to meet customer delivery requirements and to avoid inventory obsolescence. Due to our building-block designs, our inventory can generally be used with multiple different products, lowering working capital requirements and reducing the risk of inventory write-downs.\nCompetition\nThe market for our products is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to new technological developments, changing customer needs and new product introductions. We compete primarily with large vendors of x86-based general purpose servers and components. In addition, we also compete with smaller vendors that specialize in the sale of server components and systems. In recent years, we have experienced increased competition from original design manufacturers (\"ODMs\u201d) that benefit from their scale and very low cost manufacturing and are increasingly offering their own branded products. We believe our principal competitors include:\n\u2022Global technology vendors, such as Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Lenovo; and\n\u2022ODMs, such as Foxconn, Quanta Computer, and Wiwynn Corporation.\n\u2022OEMs, such as Inspur\nThe principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\n\u2022First to market with new emerging technologies;\n\u2022High product performance, efficiency and reliability;\n\u2022Early identification of emerging opportunities;\n\u2022Cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022Interoperability of products;\n\u2022Scalability; and\n\u2022Localized and responsive customer support on a worldwide basis.\nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to most of these factors. However, most of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater name recognition and deeper market penetration. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can, which could allow them to respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer needs. In addition, it is possible that new competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. See Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" risk titled \u201cThe market in which we participate is highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, we may not be able to increase our market penetration, grow our net sales or improve our gross margins.\u201d\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2021, we employed 4,155 full time employees, consisting of 1,858 employees in research and development, 460 employees in sales and marketing, 425 employees in general and administrative and 1,412 employees in manufacturing. Of these employees, 2,367 employees are based in our San Jose facilities. We consider our highly qualified and motivated employees to be a key factor in our business success. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.\n\u201cThe key to success in technology is designing a company around people committed to work that they love\u201d, quote from Charles Liang, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. We are motivated to attract, develop and retain a high performing team engaged in work that they love, motivated by growth opportunities.\nTalent Strategy\nOur talent strategy focuses on attracting skilled, engaged employees who contribute the talent and skills critical to our innovative and forward-looking workforce. Our recruiting process actively sources talent supporting our ability to hire candidates with professional qualifications and potentials. We identify opportunities through tracking and analyzing data from various sources such as annual performance reviews to assess our progress in ensuring critical talents are in critical roles.\nIt is our policy to ensure equal employment opportunity for all applicants and employees without regard to prohibited considerations of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability or genetic information, marital status or any other classification protected by applicable local, state or federal laws. All employees receive training in the prevention of sexual harassment and abusive conduct in the workplace.\nTotal Rewards Program\nOur total rewards program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, incentive bonus programs, and long-term equity awards, including restricted stock units and options, tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term company performance and integrating compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer U.S. employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, sick leave, holiday pay, and a 401(k) plan. Outside of the U.S., we provide benefits based on local requirement and needs.\nHealth & Safety\nFrom the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively implemented preventative protocols, which we continuously assess and update for changes in conditions and applicable regulations. These preventative protocols are intended to safeguard our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, and to ensure business continuity. We are\nfollowing government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and are committed to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities.\nWe continuously assess our efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, which include the following:\n\u2022We require that on-site employees complete a daily health questionnaire, pass through thermal scanning equipment installed in some of our buildings to ensure they do not have an elevated body temperature, and adhere to social distance requirement and mask protocols;\n\u2022We have enhanced our contact tracing, significantly decreased non-priority business travel, and provided personal air purifier for each of the employees; and\n\u2022To respond to changing COVID-19 updates, we continue to work closely with our Environmental Health and Safety team to monitor and provide weekly updates to managers and promote and encourage employees to receive COVID-19 vaccinations.\nWe believe these actions are appropriate and essential to safeguard our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities while allowing us to safely continue operations.\nCorporate Information\nWe were founded in, and maintain our worldwide headquarters and the majority of our employees in San Jose, California. We are one of the largest employers in the City of San Jose and an active member of the San Jose and Silicon Valley community.\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1993. We reincorporated in Delaware in March 2007. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cSMCI.\u201d Our principal executive offices are located at 980 Rock Avenue, San Jose, California 95131, and our telephone number is (408) 503-8000. Our website address is www.supermicro.com.\nFinancial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nPlease see Part II, Item 8, Note 18, \u201cSegment Reporting\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for information regarding segment reporting and Part II, Item 8, Note 3, \u201cRevenue - Disaggregation of Revenue\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for information regarding our net sales by geographic region. See Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further information on risks associated with our international operations.\nWorking Capital\nWe focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working capital related items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and using our industry experience to forecast demand. We place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the computer server industry is characterized by short lead-time orders and quick delivery schedules.\nAdditionally, during the fiscal year 2021, the computer server industry is experiencing global supply chain shortage, which requires us to carry more inventories to fulfill our customers and partners\u2019 demands and backlogs.\nAvailable Information\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) are available free of charge, on or through our website at www.supermicro.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such reports with, or furnish those reports to, the SEC. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference in, or made part of, this Annual Report or our other filings with, or reports furnished to the SEC.

be affected by changes in the relative mix of our operations and income among different geographic regions and by changes in domestic and foreign income tax laws.\n\u2022Backlog does not provide a substantial portion of our net sales in any quarter.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\n\u2022The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile.\n\u2022Future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\n\u2022The concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\n\u2022We do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral Risks\n\u2022Our products may not be viewed as supporting climate change mitigation in the IT sector.\n\u2022Our business and operations may be impacted by natural disaster events, including those brought on by climate change.\nOperational and Execution Risks\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, and there are no assurances adverse effects will not continue.\nThe novel strain of the coronavirus identified in Wuhan, China in late 2019 (COVID-19) spread throughout the world and resulted in authorities imposing, and businesses and individuals implementing, numerous unprecedented measures to try to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and shutdowns. These measures impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners.\nDuring the pandemic, we continued our manufacturing operations and customers\u2019 orders processing and services, although our productivity at times slowed especially in the United States and in the Netherlands. Travel restrictions and logistics challenges impacted, and continue to have an impact on, our supply chain. The pandemic also impacted shipments to our customers and (to a lesser extent) our ability to provide services and support to our customers. We have invested capital to procure key components so we can maintain reasonable lead times to fulfill orders for our customers. While there are positive signs with vaccine availability and reductions in infection rates, particularly in the United States, the possibility of new virus strains, vaccine supply constraints, and high infection rates, particularly in other places around the world makes us unable to predict the ultimate extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic may further impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\nThe extent to which the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to control or predict, including:\n\u2022the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the extent and effectiveness of responsive actions by authorities and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers and vendors;\n\u2022difficulty in adding new customers due to inability to gain direct access;\n\u2022the rate of spending on server and storage solutions, including delays in prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and delays in the provisioning of our products;\n\u2022the rate at which our suppliers develop and release new components such as microprocessors and memory;\n\u2022the rate at which our customers can perform acceptance testing or qualify our products, particularly if they contain new technologies;\n\u2022the length of heightened unemployment and economic recession pressures;\n\u2022the health impact of the pandemic on our employees, including key personnel;\n\u2022the impact on the liquidity of our sales partners and end customers, including lengthening of customers payment terms and potential bankruptcies;\n\u2022our continued ability to execute on business continuity plans for the maintenance of our critical business processes and managing our liquidity and access to credit facilities on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022availability of and fluctuations in the cost of materials, logistics and labor; and\n\u2022erosion of economic activity by small and medium size business or sectors to which we are exposed through OEMs and indirect sales channels.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated and will likely fluctuate in the future, which could cause rapid declines in our stock price.\nWe believe that our quarterly operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuation due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors that may affect quarterly operating results include:\n\u2022Fluctuations in demand for our products, in part due to changes in the global economic environment;\n\u2022Fluctuations based upon seasonality, with the quarters ending March 31 and September 30 typically being weaker;\n\u2022The occurrence of global pandemics, including COVID-19, and other events that impact the global economy or one or more sectors of the global economy;\n\u2022The ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing or fund capital expenditures;\n\u2022Fluctuations in the timing and size of large customer orders, including with respect to changes in sales and implementation cycles of our products into our customers\u2019 spending plans and associated revenue;\n\u2022Variability of our margins based on the mix of server and storage systems, subsystems and accessories we sell and the percentage of our sales to internet data center, cloud computing customers or certain geographical regions;\n\u2022Fluctuations in availability and costs associated with key components, particularly semiconductors, memory, storage solutions, and other materials needed to satisfy customer requirements, especially during a period of global market disruption, and, in particular, the impact of the extended duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain and the supply chain of our suppliers;\n\u2022The timing of the introduction of new products by leading microprocessor vendors and other suppliers;\n\u2022The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and evolving markets, and incorporating emerging technologies in our products, as well as the adoption of new standards;\n\u2022Changes in our product pricing policies, including those made in response to new product announcements;\n\u2022Mix of whether customer purchases are of partially or fully integrated systems or subsystems and accessories and whether made directly or through our indirect sales channel partners;\n\u2022The effect of mergers and acquisitions among our competitors, suppliers, customers, or partners;\n\u2022General economic conditions in our geographic markets;\n\u2022Geopolitical tensions, including trade wars, tariffs and/or sanctions in our geographic markets;\n\u2022Impact of regulatory changes on our cost of doing business; and\n\u2022Costs associated with remediation and legal proceedings related to restatement of our financial statements in prior years.\nIn addition, customers may hesitate to purchase, or not continue to purchase, our products based upon past unwarranted reports about security risks associated with the use of our products. Accordingly, our growth and results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly basis. If we fail to meet expectations of investors or analysts, our stock price may fall rapidly and without notice. Furthermore, the fluctuation of quarterly operating results may render less meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our operating results, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance.\nOur revenue and margins for a particular period are difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue or decline in margins may harm our operating results.\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this Annual Report, our revenue and margins for a particular quarter are difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, steps we are taking in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased competition, the effects of the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China and related market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods.\nThe timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. For instance, our larger customers may seek to fulfill all or substantially all of their requirements in a single or a few orders, and not make another significant purchase for a substantial period of time. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.\nWe plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.\nAs we increasingly target larger customers and larger sales opportunities, our customer base may become more concentrated, our cost of sales may increase, our margins may be lower and our sales may be less predictable.\nWe have become increasingly dependent upon larger sales to grow our business. In particular, in recent years, we have completed larger sales to leading internet data center and cloud customers, large enterprise customers and OEMs. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020 or 2019. If customers buy our products in greater volumes and their business becomes a larger percentage of our net sales, we may grow increasingly dependent on those customers to maintain our growth. If our largest customers do not purchase our products, or we are unable to supply such customers with products, at the levels, in the timeframes or within the geographies that we expect, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on their or our businesses, our ability to maintain or grow our net sales will be adversely affected.\nIncreased sales to larger customers may also cause fluctuations in results of operations. Large orders are generally subject to intense competition and pricing pressure which can have an adverse impact on our margins and results of operations. Accordingly, a significant increase in revenue during the period in which we recognize the revenue from a large customer may be followed by a period of time during which the customer either does not purchase any products or only a small number of our products.\nAdditionally, as we and our partners focus increasingly on selling to larger customers and attracting larger orders, we expect greater costs of sales. Our sales cycle may become longer and more expensive, as larger customers typically spend more time negotiating contracts than smaller customers. Larger customers also often seek greater levels of support in the implementation and use of our server solutions. An actual or perceived inability to meet customer support demands may adversely affect our relationship with such customers, which may affect the likelihood of future purchases of our products.\nAs a result of the above factors, our quarter-to-quarter results of operations may be subject to greater fluctuation and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to meet any publicly announced financial guidance or other expectations about our business, it could cause our stock to decline in value.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided forward looking financial guidance when we announced our financial results for the prior quarter. No assurances can be given that we will continue to provide forward looking financial guidance, and if we do issue forward looking guidance, the uncertainties related to these items could cause us to revise such guidance. If issued, we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking guidance at any time. In the past, our financial results have failed to meet the guidance we provided. There are a number of reasons why we have failed to meet guidance in the past and might fail again in the future, including, but not limited to, the factors described in these Risk Factors.\nIncreases in average selling prices for our server solutions have historically significantly contributed to increases in net sales in some of the periods covered by this Annual Report. Such prices are subject to decline if customers do not continue to purchase our latest generation products or additional components, which could harm our results of operations.\nIncreases in average selling prices for our server solutions have significantly contributed to increases in net sales in some of the periods covered by this Annual Report. Recently, the market for key components has become more volatile during the COVID-19 pandemic. As with most electronics based products, average selling prices of server and storage products are typically highest at the time of introduction of new products, which utilize the latest technology, and tend to decrease over time as such products become commoditized and are ultimately replaced by even newer generation products. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any decline in the average selling prices of our server solutions that we may experience in the future, which may be exacerbated by continued effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. In some instances, our agreements with our indirect sales channel partners limit our ability to reduce prices unless we make such price reductions available to them, or price protect their inventory. If we are unable to decrease the average per unit manufacturing costs faster than the rate at which average selling prices continue to decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nOur cost structure and ability to deliver server solutions to customers in a timely manner may be adversely affected by volatility of the market for core components and certain materials for our products.\nPrices of certain materials and core components utilized in the manufacture of our server and storage solutions, such as serverboards, chassis, CPUs, memory, hard drives and SSDs, represent a significant portion of our cost of sales. While we have increased our purchases of certain critical materials and core components in response to the supply and demand uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not have long-term supply contracts for all critical materials and core components, but instead often purchase these materials and components on a purchase order basis. Prices of these core components and materials are volatile, and, as a result, it is difficult to predict expense levels and operating results. In addition, if our business growth renders it necessary or appropriate to transition to longer term contracts with materials and core component suppliers, our costs may increase and our gross margins could correspondingly decrease.\nBecause we often acquire materials and key components on an as needed basis, we may be limited in our ability to effectively and efficiently respond to customer orders because of the then-current availability or the terms and pricing of these materials and key components. Our industry has experienced materials shortages and delivery delays in the past, including as a result of the negative impact of COVID-19 on global supply chains, and we may experience shortages or delays of critical materials or increased logistics costs to obtain necessary materials in a timely manner in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widely reported shortages of semiconductors. From time to time, we have been forced to delay the introduction of certain of our products or the fulfillment of customer orders as a result of shortages of materials and key components, which can adversely impact our revenue. If shortages, supply or demand imbalances or delays arise, the prices of these materials and key components may increase or the materials and key components may not be available at all. In the event of shortages, some of our larger competitors may have greater abilities to obtain materials and key components due to their larger purchasing power. We may not be able to secure enough key components or materials at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products to meet customer demand, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, from time to time, we have accepted customer orders with various types of component pricing protection. Such arrangements have increased our exposure to component pricing fluctuations and have adversely affected our financial results in certain quarters.\nIf we were to lose any of our current supply or contract manufacturing relationships, the process of identifying and qualifying a new supplier or contract manufacturer who meets our quality and delivery requirements, and who will appropriately safeguard our intellectual property, may require a significant investment of time and resources, adversely affecting our ability to satisfy customer purchase orders and delaying our ability to rapidly introduce new products to market. Similarly, if any of our suppliers were to cancel, materially change contracts or commitments to us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer demand for our products, whether due to shortages or other reasons, our reputation and relationships with customers could be damaged. We could lose orders, be unable to develop or sell some products cost-effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and have significantly decreased revenues, margins and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may lose sales or incur unexpected expenses relating to insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory.\nTo offer greater choices and optimization of our products to benefit our customers, we maintain a high level of inventory. If we fail to maintain sufficient inventory, we may not be able to meet demand for our products on a timely basis, and our sales may suffer. If we overestimate customer demand for our products, we could experience excess inventory of our products and be unable to sell those products at a reasonable price, or at all. As a result, we may need to record higher inventory reserves. In addition, from time to time we assume greater inventory risk in connection with the purchase or manufacture of more specialized components in connection with higher volume sales opportunities. There are uncertainties and risks related to COVID-19, for which we have taken certain actions including our increased purchase of certain critical materials and components as a part of our pandemic response planning. Specifically, we sought to actively manage our supply chain for potential risks of shortage by first building inventories of critical components required for our motherboards and other system printed circuit boards in response to the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Since that time we have continued to add to our inventories of key components such as CPUs, memory, SSDs and to a lesser extent GPUs such that customer orders can be fulfilled as they are received. Nevertheless, no assurances can be given that such efforts will be successful to manage inventory, and we could be exposed to risks of insufficient, excess, or obsolete inventory. We have from time to time experienced inventory write downs associated with higher volume sales that were not completed as anticipated. We expect that we will experience such write downs from time to time in the future related to existing and future commitments, and potentially related to our proactive purchase of certain critical materials and components as part of our planning in light of COVID-19. Excess or obsolete inventory levels for these or other reasons could result in unexpected expenses or increases in our reserves against potential future charges which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDifficulties we encounter relating to automating internal controls utilizing our ERP systems or integrating processes that occur in other IT applications could adversely impact our controls environment.\nMany companies have experienced challenges with their ERP systems that have had a negative effect on their business. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional expenses related to our ERP systems, particularly as we continue to further enhance and develop them including by automating certain internal controls. Any future disruptions, delays or deficiencies relating to automating internal controls utilizing our ERP systems or integrating processes that occur in other IT applications could adversely affect our ability to file reports with the SEC in a timely manner, deliver accurate financial statements and otherwise impact our controls environment. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSystem security violations, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cyber-security issues could disrupt our internal operations or compromise the security of our products, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nMalicious computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. While we employ a number of protective measures, including firewalls, anti-virus and endpoint detection and response technologies, these measures may fail to prevent or detect attacks on our systems. While there have been unauthorized intrusions into our network in the past, none of these intrusions, individually or in the aggregate, had a material adverse effect on our business, operations, or products. We have taken steps to enhance the security of our network and computer systems but, despite these efforts, we may experience future intrusions, which could adversely affect our business, operations, or products. In addition, our hardware and software or third party components and software that we utilize in our products may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation or security of the products. The costs to us to eliminate or mitigate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and, if our efforts to address these problems are not successful, could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Any claim that our products or systems are subject to a cyber-security risk, whether valid or not, could damage our reputation and adversely impact our revenues and results of operations.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business as well as information from our suppliers and customers. Breaches of our or any of our third party suppliers\u2019 security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or suppliers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us or our customers or suppliers to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nTo the extent we experience cyber-security incidents in the future, our relationships with our customers and suppliers may be materially impacted, our brand and reputation may be harmed and we could incur substantial costs in responding to and remediating the incidents and in resolving any investigations or disputes that may arise with respect to them, any of which would cause our business, operations, or products to be adversely affected. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing and adding further data protection measures could be significant.\nAny failure to adequately expand or retain our sales force will impede our growth.\nWe expect that our direct sales force will continue to grow as larger customers increasingly require a direct sales approach. Competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need is intense, and we face significant competition for direct sales personnel from our competitors. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, retaining and successfully managing sufficient qualified direct sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may take six months or longer before they reach full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain sufficient numbers of productive sales personnel, our customer relationships and resulting sales of our server solutions will suffer.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and Ablecom and Compuware, and those conflicts may adversely affect our operations.\nWe use Ablecom, a related party, for contract design and manufacturing coordination support and warehousing, and Compuware, also a related party and an affiliate of Ablecom, for distribution, contract manufacturing and warehousing. We work with Ablecom to optimize modular designs for our chassis and certain of other components. We outsource to Compuware a portion of our design activities and a significant part of our manufacturing of subassemblies, particularly power supplies. Our purchases of products from Ablecom and Compuware represented 7.8%, 10.1% and 9.2% of our cost of sales for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Ablecom and Compuware\u2019s sales to us constitute a substantial majority of Ablecom and Compuware\u2019s net sales. Ablecom and Compuware are both privately-held Taiwan-based companies. In addition, we have entered into a distribution agreement with Compuware, under which we have appointed Compuware as a nonexclusive distributor of our products in Taiwan, China and Australia.\nSteve Liang, Ablecom\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and largest shareholder, is the brother of Charles Liang, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors (\u201cthe Board\u201d). Steve Liang owned no shares of our common stock as of June 30, 2021, 2020 or 2019. Charles Liang and his spouse, Sara Liu, our Co-Founder, Senior Vice President and Director, jointly owned approximately 10.5% of Ablecom\u2019s capital stock, while Mr. Steve Liang and other family members owned approximately 28.8% of Ablecom\u2019s outstanding common stock as of June 30, 2021. Bill Liang, a brother of both Charles Liang and Steve Liang, is a member of the Board of Directors of Ablecom as well.\nIn October 2018, our Chief Executive Officer, Charles Liang, personally borrowed approximately $12.9 million from Chien-Tsun Chang, the spouse of Steve Liang. The loan is unsecured, has no maturity date and bore interest at 0.8% per month for the first six months, increased to 0.85% per month through February 28, 2020, and reduced to 0.25% effective March 1, 2020. The loan was originally made at Mr. Liang's request to provide funds to repay margin loans to two financial institutions, which loans had been secured by shares of our common stock that he held. The lenders called the loans in October 2018, following the suspension of our common stock from trading on NASDAQ in August 2018 and the decline in the market price of our common stock in October 2018. As of June 30, 2021, the amount due on the unsecured loan (including principal and accrued interest) was approximately $15.3 million.\nBill Liang is also the Chief Executive Officer of Compuware, a member of Compuware\u2019s Board of Directors and a holder of a significant equity interest in Compuware. Steve Liang is also a member of Compuware\u2019s Board of Directors and is an equity holder of Compuware.\nMr. Charles Liang is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, is a significant stockholder of our company, and has considerable influence over the management of our business relationships. Accordingly, we may be disadvantaged by the economic interests of Mr. Charles Liang and his spouse, Ms. Sara Liu, as stockholders of Ablecom and Mr. Charles Liang's personal relationship with Ablecom\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Compuware's Chief Executive Officer. We may not negotiate or enforce contractual terms as aggressively with Ablecom or Compuware as we might with an unrelated party, and the commercial terms of our agreements may be less favorable than we might obtain in negotiations with third parties. If our business dealings with Ablecom or Compuware are not as favorable to us as arms-length transactions, our results of operations may be harmed.\nIf Ablecom or Compuware are acquired or sold, new ownership could reassess the business and strategy of Ablecom or Compuware, and as a result, our supply chain could be disrupted or the terms and conditions of our agreements with Ablecom or Compuware may change. As a result, our operations could be negatively impacted or costs could increase, either of which could adversely affect our margins and results of operations.\nOur reliance on Ablecom could be subject to risks associated with our reliance on a limited source of contract manufacturing services and inventory warehousing.\nWe plan to continue to maintain our manufacturing relationship with Ablecom in Asia. In order to provide a larger volume of contract manufacturing services for us, we anticipate that Ablecom will continue to warehouse for us an increasing number of components and subassemblies manufactured by multiple suppliers prior to shipment to our facilities in the United States and Europe. We also anticipate that we will continue to lease office space from Ablecom in Taiwan to support our\nresearch and development efforts. We operate a joint management company with Ablecom to manage the common areas shared by us and Ablecom for our separately constructed manufacturing facilities in Taiwan.\nIf our commercial relationship with Ablecom deteriorates, we may experience delays in our ability to fulfill customer orders. Similarly, if Ablecom\u2019s facility in Asia is subject to damage, destruction or other disruptions, our inventory may be damaged or destroyed, and we may be unable to find adequate alternative providers of contract manufacturing services in the time that we or our customers require. We could lose orders and be unable to develop or sell some products cost-effectively or on a timely basis, if at all.\nCurrently, we purchase contract manufacturing services primarily for our chassis products from Ablecom. If our commercial relationship with Ablecom were to deteriorate or terminate, establishing direct relationships with those entities supplying Ablecom with key materials for our products or identifying and negotiating agreements with alternative providers of warehouse and contract manufacturing services might take a considerable amount of time and require a significant investment of resources. Pursuant to our agreements with Ablecom and subject to certain exceptions, Ablecom has the exclusive right to be our supplier of the specific products developed under such agreements. As a result, if we are unable to obtain such products from Ablecom on terms acceptable to us, we may need to discontinue a product or develop substitute products, identify a new supplier, change our design and acquire new tooling, all of which could result in delays in our product availability and increased costs. If we need to use other suppliers, we may not be able to establish business arrangements that are, individually or in the aggregate, as favorable as the terms and conditions we have established with Ablecom. If any of these things should occur, our net sales, margins and earnings could significantly decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf negative publicity arises with respect to us, our employees, our third-party service providers or our partners, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, regardless of whether the negative publicity is true.\nNegative publicity about our company or our products, even if inaccurate or untrue, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in our products, which could harm our business and operating results. For example, in October 2018, a news article was published alleging that malicious hardware chips were implanted on our motherboards during the manufacturing process at the facilities of a contract manufacturer in China. We undertook a thorough investigation of this claim with the assistance of a leading, independent third-party investigations firm wherein we tested a representative sample of our motherboards, including the specific type of motherboard depicted in the news article and motherboards purchased by companies referenced in the article, as well as more recently manufactured motherboards. After completing these examinations as well as a range of functional tests, the investigations firm reported that it had found no evidence of malicious hardware on our motherboards. In addition, neither the publisher of the news article nor any of our customers have ever provided a single example of any such altered motherboard. However, despite repeated denials of any tampering by our customers and us, and the announcement of the results of this independent investigation, the publication of this false allegation in 2018 had a substantial negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and our reputation. The October 2018 news article, the follow up news article published in January 2021, and any similar future article making similar false allegations, may continue to have a negative impact in the future.\nHarm to our reputation can also arise from many other sources, including employee misconduct, which we have experienced in the past, and misconduct by our partners and outsourced service providers. Additionally, negative publicity with respect to our partners or service providers could also affect our business and operating results to the extent that we rely on these partners or if our customers or prospective customers associate our company with these partners.\nIf we lose Charles Liang, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, or any other key employee or are unable to attract additional key employees, we may not be able to implement our business strategy in a timely manner.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of our current executive management team and other key employees. In particular, Charles Liang, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, is critical to the overall management of our company as well as to our strategic direction. Mr. Liang co-founded our company and has been our Chief Executive Officer since our inception. His experience in leading our business and his personal involvement in key relationships with suppliers, customers and strategic partners are extremely valuable to our company. We currently do not have a succession plan for the replacement of Mr. Liang if it were to become necessary. Additionally, we are particularly dependent on the continued service of our existing research and development personnel because of the complexity of our products and technologies. Our employment arrangements with our executives and employees do not require them to provide services to us for any specific length of time, and they can terminate their employment with us at any time, with or without\nnotice, without penalty. The loss of services of any of these executives or of one or more other key members of our team could seriously harm our business.\nOur direct sales efforts may create confusion for our end customers and harm our relationships in our indirect sales channel and with our OEMs.\nWe expect our direct sales force to continue to grow as our business grows. As our direct sales force becomes larger, our direct sales efforts may lead to conflicts in our indirect sales channel and with our OEMs, who may view our direct sales efforts as undermining their efforts to sell our products. If an indirect sales channel partner or OEM deems our direct sales efforts to be inappropriate, they may not effectively market our products, may emphasize alternative products from competitors, or may seek to terminate our business relationship. Disruptions in our indirect channels could cause our revenues to decrease or fail to grow as expected. Our failure to implement an effective direct sales strategy that maintains and expands our relationships in our indirect sales channel and with our OEMs could lead to a decline in sales, harm relationships and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract and integrate additional key employees in a manner that enables us to scale our business and operations effectively, or if we do not maintain competitive compensation policies to retain our employees, our ability to operate effectively and efficiently could be limited.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract additional highly qualified personnel, including additional engineers and executive staff. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where we are headquartered. We have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we are unable to attract and integrate additional key employees in a manner that enables us to scale our business and operations effectively, or if we do not maintain competitive compensation policies to retain our employees, our ability to operate effectively and efficiently could be limited.\nStrategic and Industry Risks\nIf we do not successfully manage the expansion of our international manufacturing capacity and business operations, our business could be harmed.\nSince inception, we have conducted a majority of our manufacturing operations in San Jose, California. We continue to increase our manufacturing capacity in Taiwan and in the Netherlands, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have sought to accelerate manufacturing in Taiwan in order to better diversify our geographical manufacturing concentration. In order to continue to successfully increase our operations in Taiwan, we must efficiently manage our Taiwan operations from our headquarters in San Jose, California and continue to develop a strong local management team. If we are unable to successfully ramp up our international manufacturing capacity, including the associated increased logistics and warehousing, we may incur unanticipated costs, difficulties in making timely delivery of products or suffer other business disruptions which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our business for growth and expansion.\nOver time we expect to continue to make investments to pursue new customers and expand our product and service offerings to grow our business. We also expect that our annual operating expenses will continue to increase as we invest in sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing and production infrastructure, software and product service offerings, and strengthen customer service and support resources for our customers. Our failure to expand operational and financial or internal control systems timely or efficiently could result in additional operating inefficiencies, which could increase our costs and expenses more than we had planned and prevent us from successfully executing our business plan. We may not be able to offset the costs of operation expansion by leveraging the economies of scale from our growth in negotiations with our suppliers and contract manufacturers. Additionally, if we increase our operating expenses in anticipation of the growth of our business and this growth does not meet our expectations, our financial results will be negatively impacted.\nIf our business grows, we will have to manage additional product design projects, materials procurement processes and sales efforts and marketing for an increasing number of SKUs, provide and update an increasing amount of software utilized in our hardware offerings, provide more sophisticated product service offerings to support our customers, and expand the number and scope of our relationships with suppliers, distributors and end customers. If we fail to manage these additional\nresponsibilities and relationships successfully, we may incur significant costs, which may negatively impact our operating results. Additionally, in our efforts to be first to market with new products with innovative functionality and features, we may devote significant research and development resources to products and product features for which a market does not develop quickly, or at all. If we are not able to predict market trends accurately, we may not benefit from such research and development activities, and our results of operations may suffer.\nManaging our business for long-term growth also requires us to successfully manage our employee headcount. We must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. If our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our employees, our business may be harmed. While in the past we have had significant growth in headcount, particularly during periods of rapid growth, our headcount has remained relatively flat in recent periods. A growth in headcount would continue to increase our cost base, which would make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan.\nWe depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products, and if we fail to predict or respond to emerging technological trends and our customers\u2019 changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of operations. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. If our customers do not purchase our products, our business will be harmed. The COVID-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products in various sectors, along with capital spending reductions or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product offerings to match customer needs.\nThe process of developing products incorporating new technologies is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept. If the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. Also, suppliers of our key components may introduce new technologies that are critical to the functionality of our products at a slower rate than their competition, which could adversely impact our ability to timely develop and provide competitive offerings to our customers. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours. In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings.\nFurthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our suppliers, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. The success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, market acceptance of these products, and providing appropriate support of these products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products.\nThe market in which we participate is highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, we may not be able to increase our market penetration, grow our net sales or improve our gross margins.\nThe market for server and storage solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. The market continues to evolve with the growth of public cloud shifting server and storage purchasing from traditional data centers to lower margin public cloud vendors. Barriers to entry in our market are relatively low and we expect increased challenges from existing as well as new competitors. Some of our principal competitors offer server solutions at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing\npressures on sales of our server solutions. We expect further downward pricing pressure from our competitors and expect that we will have to price some of our server and storage solutions aggressively to increase our market share with respect to those products or geographies, particularly for internet data center and cloud customers and other large sale opportunities. If we are unable to maintain the margins on our server and storage solutions, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, if we do not develop new innovative solutions, or enhance the reliability, performance, efficiency and other features of our existing server and storage solutions, our customers may turn to our competitors for alternatives. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally may also result in reduced sales, less efficient utilization of our manufacturing operations, lower margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur principal competitors include global technology companies such as Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Lenovo. In addition, we also compete with a number of other vendors who also sell application optimized servers, contract manufacturers/OEMs and original design manufacturers (\u201cODMs\u201d), such as Foxconn, Inspur, Quanta Computer and Wiwynn Corporation. ODMs sell server solutions marketed or sold under a third-party brand.\nMany of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as:\n\u2022Greater name recognition and deeper market penetration;\n\u2022Longer operating histories;\n\u2022Larger sales and marketing organizations and research and development teams and budgets;\n\u2022More established relationships with customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers and better channels to reach larger customer bases and larger sales volume allowing for better costs;\n\u2022Larger customer service and support organizations with greater geographic scope;\n\u2022A broader and more diversified array of products and services; and\n\u2022Substantially greater financial, technical and other resources.\nSome of our current or potential ODM competitors are also currently or have in the past been suppliers to us. As a result, they may possess sensitive knowledge or experience which may be used against us competitively and/or which may require us to alter our supply arrangements or sources in a way which could adversely impact our cost of sales or results of operations.\nOur competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Competitors may seek to copy our innovations and use cost advantages from greater size to compete aggressively with us on price. Certain customers are also current or prospective competitors and as a result, assistance that we provide to them as customers may ultimately result in increased competitive pressure against us. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our application optimized server and storage solutions are more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products in lieu of purchasing our products. The challenges we face from larger competitors will become even greater if consolidation or collaboration between or among our competitors occurs in our industry. Also, initiatives like the Open Compute Project, a project to establish more industry standard data center configurations, could have the impact of supporting an approach which is less favorable to the flexibility and customization that we offer. These changes could have a significant impact on the market and impact our results of operations. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, and if we do not compete effectively, our ability to increase our net sales may be impaired.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward consolidation in our industry. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. Companies that are suppliers in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are more likely to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. Additionally, at times in the past, our competitors have acquired certain customers of ours and terminated our business relationships with such customers. As such, acquisitions by our competitors could also lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe must work closely with our suppliers to make timely new product introductions.\nWe rely on our close working relationships with our suppliers, including Intel, AMD and Nvidia, to anticipate and deliver new products on a timely basis when new generation materials and key components are made available. If we are not able to maintain our relationships with our suppliers or continue to leverage their research and development capabilities to develop new technologies desired by our customers, our ability to quickly offer advanced technology and product innovations to our customers would be impaired. We have no long term agreements that obligate our suppliers to continue to work with us or to supply us with products.\nOur suppliers\u2019 failure to improve the functionality and performance of materials and key components for our products may impair or delay our ability to deliver innovative products to our customers.\nWe need our material and key component suppliers, such as Intel, AMD and Nvidia, to provide us with components that are innovative, reliable and attractive to our customers. Due to the pace of innovation in our industry, many of our customers may delay or reduce purchase decisions until they believe that they are receiving best of breed products that will not be rendered obsolete by an impending technological development. Accordingly, demand for new server and storage systems that incorporate new products and features is significantly impacted by our suppliers\u2019 new product introduction schedules and the functionality, performance and reliability of those new products. If our materials and key component suppliers fail to deliver new and improved materials and components for our products, we may not be able to satisfy customer demand for our products in a timely manner, or at all. If our suppliers\u2019 components do not function properly, we may incur additional costs and our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components used to manufacture our products.\nCertain components used in the manufacture of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these essential materials due to an interruption of supply, including interruptions on the global supply chain in connection with COVID-19, or increased demand in the industry. One of our suppliers accounted for 20.3%, 26.8%, and 21.8% of total purchases of components for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Ablecom and Compuware, related parties, accounted for 7.8%, 10.1% and 9.2% of our total cost of sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If any of our largest suppliers discontinue their operations or if our relationships with them are adversely impacted, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also \u201c-Our cost structure and ability to deliver server solutions to customers in a timely manner may be adversely affected by volatility of the market for core components and certain materials for our products.\u201d\nWe rely on indirect sales channels and any disruption in these channels could adversely affect our sales.\nWe depend on our indirect sales channel partners to assist us in promoting market acceptance of our products. To maintain and potentially increase our revenue and profitability, we will have to successfully preserve and expand our existing distribution relationships as well as develop new channel relationships. Our indirect sales channel partners also sell products offered by our competitors and may elect to focus their efforts on these sales. If our competitors offer our indirect sales channel more favorable terms or have more products available to meet the needs of their customers, or utilize the leverage of broader product lines sold through the indirect sales channel, those channel partners may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In addition, the order decision-making process in our indirect sales channel is complex and involves several factors, including end customer demand, warehouse allocation and marketing resources, which can make it difficult to accurately predict total sales for the quarter until late in the quarter. We also do not control the pricing or discounts offered by our indirect sales channel partners to the end customers. To maintain our participation in the marketing programs of our indirect sales channel partners, we have provided and expect to continue to offer cooperative marketing arrangements and offer short-term pricing concessions.\nThe discontinuation of cooperative marketing arrangements or pricing concessions could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our indirect sales channel partners could also modify their business practices, such as payment terms, inventory levels or order patterns. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships in our indirect sales channel or expand our channel or we experience unexpected changes in payment terms, inventory levels or other practices in our indirect sales channel, our business will suffer.\nOur failure to deliver high quality server and storage solutions could damage our reputation and diminish demand for our products.\nOur server and storage solutions are critical to our customers\u2019 business operations. Our customers require our server and storage solutions to perform at a high level, contain valuable features and be extremely reliable. The design of our server and storage solutions is sophisticated and complex, and the process for manufacturing, assembling and testing our server solutions is challenging. Occasionally, our design or manufacturing processes may fail to deliver products of the quality that our customers require. For example, in the past certain vendors have provided us with defective components that failed under certain applications. As a result, our products needed to be repaired and we incurred costs in connection with the recall and diverted resources from other projects.\nNew flaws or limitations in our server and storage solutions may be detected in the future. Part of our strategy is to bring new products to market quickly, and first-generation products may have a higher likelihood of containing undetected flaws. If our customers discover defects or other performance problems with our products, our customers\u2019 businesses, and our reputation, may be damaged. Customers may elect to delay or withhold payment for defective or underperforming server and storage solutions, request remedial action, terminate contracts for untimely delivery, or elect not to order additional products, which could result in a decrease in revenue, an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or in collection cycles for accounts receivable or subject us to the expense and risk of litigation. We may incur expense in recalling, refurbishing or repairing defective server and storage solutions sold to our customers or remaining in our inventory. If we do not properly address customer concerns about our products, our reputation and relationships with our customers may be harmed. For all of these reasons, customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products could substantially impair our ability to grow our business.\nOur growth into markets outside the United States exposes us to risks inherent in international business operations.\nWe market and sell our systems and subsystems and accessories both inside and outside the United States. We intend to expand our international sales efforts, especially into Asia, and we are expanding our business operations in Europe and Asia, particularly in Taiwan, the Netherlands and Japan. In particular, we have made, and continue to make, substantial investments for the purchase of land and the development of new facilities in Taiwan to accommodate our expected growth and the migration of a substantial portion of our contract manufacturing operations from China to Taiwan.\nOur international expansion efforts may not be successful. Our international operations expose us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States, such as:\n\u2022Heightened price sensitivity from customers in emerging markets;\n\u2022Our ability to establish local manufacturing, support and service functions, and to form channel relationships with value added resellers in non-United States markets;\n\u2022Localization of our systems and components, including translation into foreign languages and the associated expenses;\n\u2022Compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022Foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022Limited visibility into sales of our products by our channel partners;\n\u2022Greater concentration of competitors in some foreign markets than in the United States;\n\u2022Laws favoring local competitors;\n\u2022Weaker legal protections of intellectual property rights and mechanisms for enforcing those rights;\n\u2022Market disruptions created by other public health crises in regions outside the United States, such as avian flu, SARS and other diseases;\n\u2022Import and export tariffs;\n\u2022Difficulties in staffing and the costs of managing foreign operations, including challenges presented by relationships with workers\u2019 councils and labor unions; and\n\u2022Changing regional economic and political conditions.\nThese factors could limit our future international sales or otherwise adversely impact our operations or our results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon our investment in corporate ventures.\nWe have a 30% minority interest in a China corporate venture that was established to market and sell corporate venture branded systems in China based upon products and technology we supply. We record earnings and losses from the corporate venture using the equity method of accounting. Our loss exposure is limited to the remainder of our equity investment in the corporate venture which as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $4.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively. We currently do not intend to make any additional investment in this corporate venture. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, \u201cInvestment in a Corporate Venture\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. We may make investments in other corporate ventures. We do not control this corporate venture and any fluctuation in the results of operations of the corporate venture or any other similar transaction that we may enter into in the future could adversely impact, or result in fluctuations in, our results of operations.\nIn June 2020, the third-party parent company that controls our corporate venture was placed on a U.S. government export control list, along with several related entities. In addition, the United States has further prohibitions on conducting business with certain entities in China and continued to impose additional tariffs. If economic conditions or trade disputes, including trade restrictions and tariffs such as those between the United States and China, in the areas in which we market and sell our products and other key potential markets for our products continue to remain uncertain or deteriorate, it may further affect the value of our investment in the corporate venture.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nBecause our products and services may store, process and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters, which are subject to change.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other countries that involve matters central to our business, including with respect to user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, protection of minors and consumer protection. These laws can be particularly restrictive in countries outside the United States. Both in the United States and abroad, these laws and regulations constantly evolve and remain subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because our products and services store, process and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and even our inadvertent failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in investigations, claims, damages to our reputation, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations and declines in user growth, retention or engagement, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant.\nGlobal privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity for privacy and data protection are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, imposes stringent EU data protection requirements on companies established in the European Union or companies that offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, individuals in the European Union. The GDPR establishes a robust framework of data subjects\u2019 rights and imposes onerous accountability obligations on companies, with penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 million euros or four percent of annual global revenue. In addition, numerous states in the U.S. are also expanding data protection through legislation. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect on January 1, 2020, and gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provide for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. At the same time, certain developing countries in which we do business have already or are also currently considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulations. While we have implemented policies and procedures to address GDPR and other data privacy requirements, failure to comply or concerns about our practices or compliance with GDPR or other privacy-related laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations could involve the use of regulated materials, and we must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive, and may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to materials, including hazardous and toxic materials. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental, health and safety laws in the future as a result of our inability to obtain permits, human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes, we could be subject to fines, costs or civil or criminal sanctions, face third-party property damage or personal injury claims or be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to new requirements relating to the materials composition, energy efficiency and recyclability of our products, including EU eco-design requirements for servers and data storage products (Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/424). We are also subject to laws and regulations providing consumer warnings, such as California\u2019s \u201cProposition 65\u201d which requires warnings for certain chemicals deemed by the State of California to be dangerous. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis that will likely result in additional costs, and could require that we change the design and/or manufacturing of products, and could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are also subject to the Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act concerning the supply of certain minerals coming from the conflict zones in and around the Democratic Republic of Congo, and adhere to broader industry best practices to source minerals responsibly from all Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRA). These requirements and best practices can affect the cost and ease of sourcing minerals used in the manufacture of electronics.\nIf we are unable to maintain and further develop effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may decrease.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report and attestation from our independent registered public accountant on our internal control over financial reporting. Both our evaluation and the external attestation have and will continue to increase our and our independent public accountant costs and expenses.\nIn the past, we have had one or more material weaknesses, which we have remediated. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective, which could cause our stock price to decline. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIf we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease. We could also become subject to stockholder or other third-party litigation as well as investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, penalties, trading suspensions or other remedies.\nThe matters leading to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K and adverse publicity and potential concerns from our customers, including from our prior lack of effective internal control over financial reporting, have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have been and could continue to be the subject of negative publicity focused on the matters that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K. We may be adversely impacted by negative reactions to this publicity from our customers or others with whom we do business. Concerns include the time and effort required to address our accounting and control environment and our ability to be a long-term provider to our customers. The continued occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and applicable trade control laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe manufacture and sell our products in several countries outside of the United States, both to direct and OEM customers as well as through our indirect sales channel. Our operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) as well as the anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the countries where we do business. The FCPA prohibits covered parties from offering, promising, authorizing or giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to a \u201cforeign government official\u201d with the intent of improperly influencing the official\u2019s act or decision, inducing the official to act or refrain from acting in violation of lawful duty or obtaining or retaining an improper business advantage. The FCPA also requires publicly traded companies to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions, and to have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In addition, other applicable anti-corruption laws prohibit bribery of domestic government officials, and some laws that may apply to our operations prohibit commercial bribery, including giving or receiving improper payments to or from non-government parties, as well as so-called \u201cfacilitation\u201d payments.\nIn addition, we are subject to U.S. and other applicable trade control regulations that restrict with whom we may transact business, including the trade sanctions enforced by the U.S. Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations restricting dealings with sanctioned countries or companies and/or persons on restricted lists, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Any future violations could have an adverse impact on our ability to sell our products to United States federal, state and local government and related entities. We have business relationships with companies in China who have been, or may in the future be, added to the restricted party list. We take steps to minimize business disruption when these situations arise; however, we may be required to terminate or modify such relationships if our activities are prohibited by U.S. laws. Further, our association with these parties could subject us to greater scrutiny or reputational harm among current or prospective customers, partners, suppliers, investors, other parties doing business with us or using our products, or the general public. The United States and other countries continually update their lists of export-controlled items and technologies, and may impose new or more-restrictive export requirements on our products in the future. As a result of regulatory changes, we may be required to obtain licenses or other authorizations to continue supporting existing customers or to supply existing products to new customers in China and elsewhere. Further escalations in trade restrictions, particularly between the United States and China, could impede our ability to sell or support our products.\nIn addition, while we have implemented policies, internal controls and other measures reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, and certain safeguards designed to ensure compliance with U.S. trade control laws, our employees or agents have in the past engaged and may in the future engage in improper conduct for which we could be held responsible. If we, or our employees or agents acting on our behalf, are found to have engaged in practices that violate these laws and regulations, we could suffer severe fines and penalties, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation, bans on transacting government business and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our brand and reputation, our sales activities or our stock price could be adversely affected if we become the subject of any negative publicity related to actual or potential violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery or trade control laws and regulations.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and technical know-how could impair our brand and our competitiveness.\nOur ability to prevent competitors from gaining access to our technology is essential to our success. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, we may lose an important advantage in the markets in which we compete. Trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as our internal confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions are the core of our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation, and we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights. Such administrative proceedings and litigation are inherently uncertain and divert resources that could be put towards other business priorities. We may not be able to obtain a favorable outcome and may spend considerable resources in our efforts to defend and protect our intellectual property.\nFurthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate.\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and using our technology for their competitive advantage. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nResolution of claims that we have violated or may violate the intellectual property rights of others could require us to indemnify our customers, indirect sales channel partners or vendors, redesign our products, or pay significant royalties to third parties, and materially harm our business.\nOur industry is marked by a large number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violation of intellectual property rights. Our primary competitors have substantially greater numbers of issued patents than we have which may position us less favorably in the event of any claims or litigation with them. Other third parties have in the past sent us correspondence regarding their intellectual property or filed claims that our products infringe or violate third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. In addition, increasingly non-operating companies are purchasing patents and bringing claims against technology companies. We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to such claims in the future.\nSuccessful intellectual property claims against us from others could result in significant financial liability or prevent us from operating our business or portions of our business as we currently conduct it or as we may later conduct it. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our technology to obtain licenses to use intellectual property belonging to third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, to cease using the technology covered by those rights, and to indemnify our customers, indirect sales channel partners or vendors. Any claim, regardless of its merits, could be expensive and time consuming to defend against, and divert the attention of our technical and management resources.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022Establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board are generally elected at one time\n\u2022Require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022Authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our Board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022Limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022Prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022Provide that our Board is expressly authorized to adopt, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022Establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to some exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those stockholders desire.\nFinancial Risks\nWe incurred significant expenses related to the matters that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K and may incur expenses related to any resulting litigation.\nWe devoted substantial internal and external resources towards investigating, discovering, understanding and remediating the matters that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K (all as described in the 2017 10-K). As a result of these efforts, we incurred substantial incremental fees and expenses for additional accounting, financial and other consulting and professional services, as well as the implementation and maintenance of systems and processes that will need to be updated, supplemented or replaced. Specifically, in connection with these efforts, we incurred professional fees of approximately $0.5 million, $14 million, $67 million and $42 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2020, we recorded a liability of $17.5 million for our SEC settlement of the investigation into our Company's financial accounting for fiscal years 2014 to 2017. We have taken a number of steps in order to strengthen our corporate culture, sales processes, and accounting function so as to allow us to be able to provide timely and accurate financial reporting. To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be required to devote significant additional time and incur significant additional expenses. Even if these steps are successful, we may incur significant legal fees in future periods as we address litigation and regulatory action arising from the matters that led to the delay in the filing our 2017 10-K. The expenses we are incurring in this regard, as well as the substantial time devoted by our management to identify and address internal control deficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur research and development expenditures, as a percentage of our net sales, are considerably higher than many of our competitors and our earnings will depend upon maintaining revenues and margins that offset these expenditures.\nOur strategy is to focus on being consistently first-to-market with flexible and application optimized server and storage systems that take advantage of our own internal development and the latest technologies offered by microprocessor manufacturers and other component vendors. Consistent with this strategy, we spend higher amounts, as a percentage of revenues, on research and development costs than many of our competitors. If we cannot sell our products in sufficient volume and with adequate gross margins to compensate for such investment in research and development, our earnings may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future effective income tax rates could be affected by changes in the relative mix of our operations and income among different geographic regions and by changes in domestic and foreign income tax laws, which could affect our future operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201c2017 Tax Reform Act\u201d), and in December 2019, we realigned our international business operations and group structure to take advantage of certain international tax planning opportunities and incentives. Our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge our international tax structure or if the relative mix of our United States and international income changes for any reason, or due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws. In particular, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the United States.\nThe effectiveness of our tax planning activities is based upon certain assumptions that we make regarding our future operating performance and tax laws. We continue to optimize our tax structure to align with our business operations and growth strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to lower our effective tax rate as a result of our current or future tax planning activities nor that such rate will not increase in the future.\nBacklog does not provide a substantial portion of our net sales in any quarter.\nOur net sales are difficult to forecast because we do not have sufficient backlog of unfilled orders or sufficient recurring revenue to meet our quarterly net sales targets at the beginning of a quarter. Rather, a majority of our net sales in any quarter depend upon customer orders that we receive and fulfill in that quarter. Because our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future net sales and to a large extent are fixed in the short term, we might be unable to adjust spending in time to compensate for any shortfall in net sales. Accordingly, any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations would harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile, and you might not be able to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased the shares.\nThe trading prices of technology company securities historically have been highly volatile. In addition, the global markets have experienced volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors, in addition to those outlined elsewhere in this filing, that may affect the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022The impact of COVID-19 on our business, the global economy and trading markets;\n\u2022The outcome of litigation and claims as well as regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders to which we are subject;\n\u2022Actual or anticipated variations in our operating results, including failure to achieve previously provided guidance;\n\u2022Announcements of technological innovations, new products or product enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022Changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022The financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022False or misleading press releases or articles regarding our company or our products;\n\u2022The loss of a key customer;\n\u2022The loss of key personnel;\n\u2022Technological advancements rendering our products less valuable;\n\u2022Lawsuits filed against us, including those described in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d;\n\u2022Changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies that sell similar products;\n\u2022Price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022Market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole; and\n\u2022Other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, political instability or responses to these events.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nAttempts by existing stockholders to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline significantly. All of our shares are eligible for sale in the public market, including shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates, sales of which are subject to volume limitations and other requirements under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, shares subject to outstanding options and reserved for future issuance under our stock option plans are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of July 31, 2021, our executive officers, directors, current five percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially owned 42.4% of our common stock, net of treasury stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, under the terms of the credit agreement with Bank of America, dated April 19, 2018, we cannot pay any dividends, with limited exceptions. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may\nnever occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nGeneral Risks\nOur products may not be viewed as supporting climate change mitigation in the IT sector.\nAccording to the Journal Nature, the global energy demand of IT equipment is expected to be 20% of global energy demand by 2030. More than 70% of the Scope 3 (lifecycle) emissions of our server products are attributed to their use in data centers. Our ability to create energy saving products is key to climate change mitigation, and business success. In addition, climate change reporting and product certification are increasingly sought by customers and regulators. If we do not satisfy customer requirements for products that help mitigate climate change, and document how they contribute to such change, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial conditions.\nOur business and operations may be impacted by natural disaster events, including those brought on by climate change.\nLand, sea and air routes between economic centers are subject to weather events exacerbated by climate change and can disrupt commercial activity. Our most significant business offices, research and development, and manufacturing locations, are in the San Jose, California area and in Taiwan. Each region is subject to climate change events, and known for earthquakes. While we have adopted a business continuity plan, there is no certainty it will be effective for significant natural disasters, which could have a material adverse impact on business, operating results, and financial condition.",

In Asia, our manufacturing facilities are located in Taoyuan County, Taiwan where we own approximately 954,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space on 6.96 acres of land. These manufacturing facilities are pledged as security under the existing term loans with $59.8 million remaining outstanding as of June 30, 2021. Our research and development center, service operations, and warehouse space in Asia are located in an approximately 106,000 square feet facility in Taipei, Taiwan under twelve leases that expire at various dates ranging from January 2022 through May 2024 and an approximately 134,000 square feet facility in Taoyuan, Taiwan under six leases that expire from December 2021 through December 2023.\nAdditionally, we own 36 acres of land in San Jose, California that would allow us to expand our Green Computing Park. We remodeled one warehouse with approximately 310,000 square feet of storage space and completed the construction of a new manufacturing and warehouse building with approximately 182,000 square feet of manufacturing space in August 2015. In fiscal years 2019 and 2020, we continued to engage several contractors for the development and construction of improvements on the property. We completed the construction of a second new manufacturing and warehouse building in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We financed this development through our operating cash flows and borrowings from banks. See Part II, Item 8, Note 10, \u201cShort-term and Long-term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for a discussion of our company's debt.\nWe believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased, are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business.",

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly under the heading \"Risk Factors.\"\nOverview\nWe are a global leader and innovator of application-optimized high performance and high-efficiency server and storage systems for a variety of markets, including enterprise data centers, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 5G and edge computing. Our solutions include complete servers, storage systems, modular blade servers, blades, workstations, full racks, networking devices, server management software, and server sub-systems. We also provide global support and services to help our customers install, upgrade and maintain their computing infrastructure.\nWe commenced operations in 1993 and have been profitable every year since inception. For fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, our net income was $111.9 million, $84.3 million and $71.9 million, respectively. In order to increase our sales and profits, we believe that we must continue to develop flexible and application optimized server and storage solutions and be among the first to market with new features and products. We must also continue to expand our software and customer service and support offerings, particularly as we increasingly focus on larger enterprise customers. Additionally, we must focus on development of our sales partners and distribution channels to further expand our market share. We measure our financial success based on various indicators, including growth in net sales, gross profit margin and operating margin. Among the key non-financial indicators of our success is our ability to rapidly introduce new products and deliver the latest application-optimized server and storage solutions. In this regard, we work closely with microprocessor and other key component vendors to take advantage of new technologies as they are introduced. Historically, our ability to introduce new products rapidly has allowed us to benefit from technology transitions such as the introduction of new microprocessors and storage technologies, and as a result, we monitor the introduction cycles of NVIDIA Corporation, Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Micron Technology, Inc. and others closely and carefully. This also impacts our research and development expenditures as we continue to invest more in our current and future product development efforts.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Impact\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the various attempts to contain it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption for many businesses worldwide. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, including orders that govern the operations of businesses, require masks be worn and define shelter in place and social distancing protocols. We are an essential critical infrastructure (information technology) business under the relevant federal, state and county regulations. Accordingly, in late March 2020, we responded to the directives from Santa Clara County and the State of California regarding instructions to combat the spread of COVID-19. Our first priority is the safety of our workforce and we have implemented numerous health precautions and work practices to be in compliance with the law and to operate in a safe manner.\nWe quickly transitioned certain of our indirect labor forces to work from home at the earlier phase of the pandemic and continued to operate our local assembly in Taiwan and, after an initial period of disruption, in the United States and Europe. We operate in the critical industry of IT infrastructure and we assessed our customer base to identify priority customers who operate in critical industries. We continue to see ongoing demand and do not have significant direct exposure to industries such as retail, oil and gas and hospitality, which have been impacted the greatest. As time passes, we may discover greater indirect exposure to distressed industries through our channel partners and OEM customers.\nWe have actively managed our supply chain for potential shortage risk by building inventories of critical components required for our motherboards and other system printed circuit boards in response to the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Since that time, we have continued to add to our inventories of key components such as CPUs, memory, SSDs and GPUs such that customer orders can be fulfilled as they are received.\nLogistics has emerged as a new challenge as globally the transportation industry restricted the frequency of departures and increased logistics costs. We experienced increased costs in freight as well as direct labor costs as we incentivized our employees to continue to work and assist us in serving our customers, many of whom are in critical industries. We expect this trend to continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe monitor the credit profile and payment history of our customers to evaluate risk in specific industries or geographic areas where cash flow may be disrupted. While we believe that we are adequately capitalized, we actively manage our liquidity needs. In December 2020, our Taiwan subsidiary entered into a general credit agreement with E.SUN Bank in Taiwan. This general credit agreement provides for the issuance of loans, advances, acceptances, bills, bank guarantees, overdrafts, letters of credit, and other types of drawdown instruments up to a credit limit of $30 million. The term of this general credit agreement was through September 18, 2021. In June 2021, we negotiated an extension of our credit facility with Bank of America to extend the maturity date to June 2026. In July 2021, we replaced our prior credit facility and term loan facility with China Trust and Bank Corp (\"CTBC Bank\"), with a new facility for omnibus credit lines.\nOur management team is focused on guiding our company through the ongoing challenges presented by COVID-19. Currently, there are positive signs with vaccine availability and reductions in infection rates; however, with the possibility of new virus strains and vaccine supply constraints, we are unable to predict the ultimate extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic may further impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations within the next 12 months. See also \u201cBusiness-Employees and Human Capital Resources.\u201d\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following is a summary of financial highlights of fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\n\u2022Net sales increased by 6.5% in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Gross margin declined to 15.0% in fiscal year 2021 from 15.8% in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to product and customer mix and increased logistic costs.\n\u2022Operating expenses declined by 6.8% in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to the special performance bonuses to our employees and the accrual for our settlement with the SEC incurred in fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Net income increased to $111.9 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to $84.3 million in fiscal year 2020, which was primarily due to the higher net sales and lower operating expenses in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Our cash and cash equivalents were $232.3 million and $210.5 million at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. In fiscal year 2021, we generated net cash of $21.1 million, of which $123.0 million was provided by operating activities related primarily to the increase in net income. We also invested $58.0 million in purchases of property and equipment, including construction of a new facility in San Jose, California, and used $44.4 million in financing activities primarily due to the repurchase of $130.0 million of our common stock, which was offset by the proceeds from borrowings.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments we make about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because these estimates can vary depending on the situation, actual results may differ from the estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and statement of cash flows.\nA summary of significant accounting policies is included in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. Management believes the following are the most critical accounting policies and reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe most critical accounting policy estimate and judgments required in applying ASC 606, Revenue Recognition of Contracts from Customers, and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of the transaction price, distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (the \u201cSSP\u201d) for each performance obligation.\nWe generate revenues from the sale of server and storage systems, subsystems, accessories, services, server software management solutions, and support services. Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such goods or services are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship.\nAs part of determining the transaction price in contracts with customers, we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate reserves for future sales returns based on a review of our history of actual returns. Based upon historical experience, a refund liability is recorded at the time of sale for estimated product returns and an asset is recognized for the amount expected to be recorded in inventory upon product return, less the expected recovery costs. We also estimate the costs of customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings such as price protection, rebates, as well as the estimated costs of cooperative marketing arrangements where the fair value of the benefit derived from the costs cannot be reasonably estimated. Any provision is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale based on an evaluation of the contract terms and historical experience.\nWe allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP for each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered. Determining the relative SSP for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations requires significant judgement. We determine standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we apply judgment to estimate the SSP. For substantially all performance obligations, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices, internally approved pricing guidelines with respect to geographies, customer type, internal costs, and gross margin objectives for the related performance obligations which can also be influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, economic and other factors.\nThese estimates and judgements have not fluctuated significantly for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to prior fiscal years.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at lower of cost, using weighted average cost method, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of our products in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Inventories consist of purchased parts and raw materials (principally electronic components), work in process (principally products being assembled) and finished goods. We evaluate inventory on a quarterly basis for lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolescence and, as necessary, write down the valuation of inventories based upon our inventory aging, forecasted usage and sales, anticipated selling price, product obsolescence and other factors. Once inventory is written down, its new value is maintained until it is sold or scrapped.\nWe receive various rebate incentives from certain suppliers based on our contractual arrangements, including volume-based rebates. The rebates earned are recognized as a reduction of cost of inventories and reduce the cost of sales in the period when the related inventory is sold. We determine the volume-based rebates to be recognized in the cost of sales on a first-in, first-out basis.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets\nrepresent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of income become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws, or when loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets would be recorded in the consolidated statements of income for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required.\nWe recognize tax liabilities for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in applicable tax law, settlement of issues under audit and new exposures. If we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a related charge in our tax provision during the period in which we make such a determination.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and non-employees, including stock options, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d). We recognize the grant date fair value of all share-based awards over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. Stock option and RSU awards are recognized to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. PRSU awards are recognized to expense using an accelerated method only when it is probable that a performance condition is met during the vesting period. If it is not probable, no expense is recognized and the previously recognized expense is reversed. We base initial accrual of compensation expense on the estimated number of PRSUs that are expected to vest over the requisite service period. That estimate is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of PRSUs is likely to differ from previous estimates. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of PRSUs expected to vest is recognized in stock-based compensation expense in the period of the change. Previously recognized compensation expense is not reversed if vested stock options, RSUs or PRSUs for which the requisite service has been rendered and the performance condition has been met expire unexercised or are not settled.\nThe fair value of RSUs and PRSUs is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option and the expected volatility of the price of our common stock. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on our historical experience. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option awards represent management\u2019s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. Our use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we hold an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we assess whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity affect the determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interest in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nWe have concluded that Ablecom and its affiliate, Compuware, are VIEs; however, we are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have the power to direct the activities that are most significant to the entities and therefore, we do not consolidate these entities. In performing this analysis, we considered our explicit arrangements with Ablecom and Compuware, including all contractual arrangements with these entities. Also, as a result of the substantial related party relationships between us and\nthese two companies, we considered whether any implicit arrangements exist that would cause us to protect these related parties\u2019 interests from suffering losses. We determined that no material implicit arrangements exist with Ablecom, Compuware, or their shareholders.\nOur ability to assess correctly our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. Subsequent evaluations of the primary beneficiary of a VIE may require the use of different assumptions that could lead to identification of a different primary beneficiary, resulting in a different consolidation conclusion than what was determined at inception of the arrangement.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents certain items of our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue.\nNet Sales\nNet sales consist of sales of our server and storage solutions, including systems and related services and subsystems and accessories. The main factors that impact net sales of our server and storage systems are the number of compute nodes sold and the average selling prices per node. The main factors that impact net sales of our subsystems and accessories are units shipped and the average selling price per unit. The prices for our server and storage systems range widely depending upon the configuration, including the number of compute nodes in a server system as well as the level of integration of key components such as SSDs and memory. The prices for our subsystems and accessories can also vary widely based on whether a customer is purchasing power supplies, server boards, chassis or other accessories.\nA compute node is an independent hardware configuration within a server system capable of having its own CPU, memory and storage and that is capable of running its own instance of a non-virtualized operating system. The number of compute nodes sold, which can vary by product, is an important metric we use to track our business. Measuring volume using compute nodes enables more consistent measurement across different server form factors and across different vendors. As with most electronics-based product life cycles, average selling prices typically are highest at the time of introduction of new products that utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products. Additionally, in order to remain competitive throughout all industry cycles, we actively change our selling price per unit in response to changes in costs for key components such as memory and SSDs.\nThe following table presents net sales by product type for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nDuring fiscal year 2021 we experienced increased revenue from server and storage systems, particularly from our large enterprise and datacenter customers. The year-over-year increase in net sales of server and storage systems was primarily due to an increase of average selling prices per compute node by approximately 17%, offset by a decrease of approximately 9% in the number of units of compute nodes sold. We typically adjust our selling prices as component costs rise and fall. The increase in average selling prices was primarily due to significant inventory component price increases resulting from component shortages during fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year increase in net sales of subsystems and accessories was primarily due to an increase of approximately 5% in the volume of subsystems and accessories sold, mainly due to increased demand and approximately 2% increase in average selling prices due primarily to the increase in costs of the components. Our services and software revenue, included in server and storage systems revenue, increased by $0.2 million year-over-year.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nDuring fiscal year 2020 we continued to experience a steady demand for server and storage systems, particularly from our large enterprise and datacenter customers. The year-over-year decrease in net sales of server and storage systems was primarily due to a decrease of average selling prices per compute node by approximately 11%, offset by a slight increase in the number of units of compute nodes sold. We typically adjust our prices as component costs rise and fall. The decline in average selling prices was primarily due to substantially lower costs for key components, specifically for memory and storage, as compared to the previous fiscal year. The year-over-year increase in net sales of subsystems and accessories was primarily due to an increase of approximately 19% in the volume of subsystems and accessories sold, mainly due to increased demand from our indirect sales channel offset by an approximately 6% decrease in average selling prices due primarily to the decrease in costs of the components. Our services and software revenue, included in server and storage systems revenue, increased by $39.8 million year-over-year.\nThe following table presents percentages of net sales by geographic region for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nThe year-over-year increase in net sales in the United States was primarily due to an increase in net sales of our server and storage systems. The year-over-year increase in net sales in Asia was primarily due to an increase in net sales of our server and storage systems in China, Singapore, India and Japan, partially offset by a decrease in the net sales in Taiwan. The year-over-year increase in net sales in Europe was primarily due to an increase in net sales of our server and storage systems in the Germany, UK and France, partially offset by a decrease in net sales in the Netherlands and Russia.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nThe year-over-year decrease in net sales in the United States was primarily due to a decrease in net sales of our server and storage systems to our direct customers and OEMs. The year-over-year decrease in net sales in Asia was primarily due to a decrease in net sales of our server and storage systems to OEMs in China, India and Japan, partially offset by a slight increase in the net sales of subsystems and accessories in China and of server and storage systems in the rest of Asia region. The year-over-year decrease in net sales in Europe was primarily due to a decrease in net sales of our server and storage systems to our direct customers and OEMs in the Netherlands, partially offset by an increase in net sales of our subsystems and accessories to our indirect sales channel in Germany and an increase in sales to our indirect sales channel in France.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nCost of sales primarily consists of the costs to manufacture our products, including the costs of materials, contract manufacturing, shipping, personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, equipment and facility expenses, warranty costs and inventory excess and obsolescence provisions. The primary factors that impact our cost of sales are the mix of products sold and cost of materials, which include purchased parts and material costs, shipping costs, salary and benefits and overhead costs related to production. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales may increase over time if decreases in average selling prices are not offset by corresponding decreases in our costs. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is also impacted by the extent to which we are able to efficiently utilize our expanding manufacturing capacity. Because we generally do not have long-term fixed supply agreements, our cost of sales is subject to change based on the cost of materials and market conditions. As a result, our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in any period can increase due to significant component price increases resulting from component shortages.\nWe use several suppliers and contract manufacturers to design and manufacture subsystems in accordance with our specifications, with most final assembly and testing predominantly performed at our manufacturing facilities in the same region where our products are sold. During the fiscal year 2021, we continued to expand manufacturing and service operations in Taiwan primarily to support our Asian and European customers and have continued to work on improving our utilization of our overseas manufacturing capacity. We work with Ablecom, one of our key contract manufacturers and also a related party to optimize modular designs for our chassis and certain of other components. We also outsource to Compuware, also a related party, a portion of our design activities and a significant part of our manufacturing of components, particularly power supplies. Our purchases of products from Ablecom and Compuware combined represented 7.8%, 10.1% and 9.2% of our cost of sales for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For further details on our dealings with related parties, see Part II, Item 8, Note 13, \u201cRelated Party Transactions.\u201d\nCost of sales and gross margin for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, are as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nThe year-over-year increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to an increase of $244.1 million in costs of\nmaterials and contract manufacturing expenses primarily related to the increase in net sales volume and an increase of $8.9 million of freight. This was offset by a decrease of $29.5 million in overhead costs attributable primarily to a recovery of costs paid in prior periods, a decrease of $12.4 million in the provision of excess inventory and obsolescence and a decrease of $2.6 million in personnel expenses due to a decrease in special performance bonuses in the fiscal year 2021. Warranty and repairs costs also decreased by $3.4 million in the fiscal year 2021 as compared to the fiscal year 2020.\nThe period-over-period decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to sales prices increasing at a slower rate than the increase in the costs of components and due to the decrease in services and software revenue which have higher margins than product sales. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increase in both logistics costs as well as direct labor costs as we incentivize our employees to continue to work and assist us in serving our customers. This increase in costs negatively impacts our gross margins, and we expect these higher costs to continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nThe year-over-year decrease in cost of sales was primarily attributable to a decrease of $214.3 million in inventory costs related primarily to the decrease in the prices of components and a decrease of $14.6 million in the provision of excess inventory and obsolescence due to fewer excess and obsolescence items identified in the fiscal year 2020. This was offset by an increase of $19.6 million in overhead costs attributable primarily to increased tariffs and an increase of $11.3 million in personnel expenses, which included a special performance bonus of $4.1 million. Warranty and repairs costs also increased by $5.7 million in the fiscal year 2020 as compared to the fiscal year 2019.\nThe period-over-period increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to sales prices declining at a slower rate than the decline in the costs of components and due to the increase in services and software revenue which have higher margins than product sales. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increase in both logistics costs as well as direct labor costs as we incentivize our employees to continue to work and assist us in serving our customers. This increase in costs negatively impacts our gross margins, and we expect these higher costs to continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for our research and development personnel, as well as product development costs such as materials and supplies, consulting services, third-party testing services and equipment and facility expenses related to our research and development activities. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We occasionally receive non-recurring engineering funding from certain suppliers and customers for joint development. Under these arrangements, we are reimbursed for certain research and development costs that we incur as part of the joint development efforts with our suppliers and customers. These amounts offset a portion of the related research and development expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported research and development expenses.\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for our sales and marketing personnel, costs for tradeshows, independent sales representative fees and marketing programs. From time to time, we receive cooperative marketing funding from certain suppliers. Under these arrangements, we are reimbursed for certain marketing costs that we incur as part of the joint promotion of our products and those of our suppliers. These amounts offset a portion of the related expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported sales and marketing expenses. The timing, magnitude and estimated usage of these programs can result in significant variations in reported sales and marketing expenses from period to period. Spending on cooperative marketing, reimbursed by our suppliers, typically increases in connection with new product releases by our suppliers.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of general corporate costs, including personnel expenses such as salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for our general and administrative personnel, financial reporting, information technology, corporate governance and compliance, outside legal, audit, tax fees, insurance and bad debt reserves on accounts receivable.\nOperating expenses for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nThe year-over-year increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of $11.6 million in costs mainly related to materials, supplies and equipment used in product development. During the fiscal year 2020, we recorded a $9.5 million net settlement fee as a reduction in the research and development expenses related to the reimbursement of previously incurred materials, supplies and equipment costs for one canceled joint product development agreement.\nPersonnel expenses increased $1.7 million as a result of an increase in the number of research and development employees, These increases were partially offset by an increase of $8.8 million in research and development credits from certain suppliers and customers towards our development efforts and a $1.5 million decrease in trade shows and business travel as a result in a change in our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe year-over-year increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.2 million in advertising expenses, a $1.0 million increase in other sales and marketing expenses, offset by a $1.7 million decrease in trade shows and business travel as a result in a change in our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe year-over-year decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to a decrease of $41.8 million in professional fees incurred to investigate, assess and remediate the causes that led to the delay in filing our periodic reports with the SEC and the associated restatement of certain of our previously issued financial statements, a decrease of $4.1 million in other expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a $1.1 million decrease in supplies costs. These decreases were partially offset by a $12.9 million increase in personnel expenses due to increased full time personnel and bonuses.\nWe anticipate the above expenses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to normalize if and when the COVID-19 pandemic is over.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nThe year-over-year increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of $41.3 million in personnel expenses as a result of an increase in the number of research and development employees and a special performance bonus of $17.3 million, a decrease of $0.7 million in reimbursements received for certain research and development costs that we incurred as part of joint product development; an increase of $6.7 million in costs mainly related to materials, supplies and equipment used in product development, and an increase of $1.8 million in facilities expenses. During fiscal year 2020, we also recorded a $9.5 million net settlement fee as a reduction in the research and development expenses related to the reimbursement of previously incurred expenses for one canceled joint product development agreement.\nThe year-over-year increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in personnel expenses as a result of an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and a special performance bonus of $1.8 million.\nThe year-over-year decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to a decrease of $33.9 million in professional fees that were primarily incurred to investigate, assess and begin remediating the causes that led to the delay in filing our periodic reports with the SEC and the associated restatement of certain of our previously issued financial statements; a decrease of $10.2 million in bad debt provision expenses due to recovery of previously provisioned receivables from certain international customers, offset by an increase of $17.5 million related to an expense accrual for the settlement with the SEC; an increase of $14.1 million in personnel expenses as a result of an increase in the number of personnel and a special performance bonus of $4.5 million; an increase of $3.2 million in insurance expense; and an increase of $1.7 million related primarily to facilities expenses.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nOther (expense) income, net consists primarily of interest earned on our investment and cash balances and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nInterest expense represents interest expense on our term loans and lines of credit.\nInterest and other expense, net for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nThe change of $4.2 million in other (expense) income, net was attributable to a decrease of $2.4 million in interest income on our interest-bearing deposits due primarily to lower yields on investments and an increase of $1.8 million in foreign exchange loss due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nThe year-over-year change in interest expense of $4.5 million is primarily a result of lower interest rates and reduced levels of borrowings in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019. The change of $2.4 million in other (expense) income, net was attributable to an increase of $1.6 million in interest income on our interest bearing deposits and a decrease of $0.8 million in other expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax provision is based on our taxable income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate, primarily the United States, Taiwan, and the Netherlands. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits, uncertain tax positions, tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income and stock based compensation. A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Part II, Item 8, Note 15, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nThe year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a release of reserve from uncertain tax positions in the prior year.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nThe year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from research and development tax credits, stock based compensation, releases of uncertain tax positions, and U.S. sales to foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by the tax impact from the non-deductible settlement with the SEC.\nShare of (Loss) from Equity Investee, Net of Taxes\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nThe year-over-year decrease of $2.2 million in share of income from equity investee, net of taxes was primarily due to lower net income recognized by the Corporate Venture in the fiscal year 2021 as compared to 2020.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nThe year-over-year increase of $5.1 million from share of (loss) to income from equity investee, net of taxes was primarily due to net income recognized by the Corporate Venture in the fiscal year 2020 as compared to net loss in the fiscal year 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our growth primarily with funds generated from operations, in addition to utilizing borrowing facilities, particularly in relation to the financing of real property acquisitions as well as an increase in the need for working capital due to longer supply chain manufacturing and delivery times. Our cash and cash equivalents were $232.3 million and $210.5 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our cash in foreign locations was $152.6 million and $98.0 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAmounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations generally will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through operating cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, borrowing capacity available from our credit facilities and internally generated cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating businesses and maturing debt and interest payments for the twelve months following the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. We expect to pay a special performance bonus of approximately $4.0 million to our CEO within the next year. During the fiscal year 2021, the target average closing price of our common stock condition for the bonus was satisfied but no determination has been made if the specified performance condition has been satisfied.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we retired 1,333,125 shares of common stock repurchased in prior years. Additionally, we repurchased and retired 4,209,211 shares of common stock for an aggregated $130.0 million under multiple share repurchase programs. All programs were completed during the fiscal year except for the program approved on January 29, 2021 to repurchase up to an aggregate of $200.0 million of our common stock at market prices. The program is effective until July 31, 2022 or if earlier, until the maximum amount of common stock is repurchased. As of June 30, 2021, we still had $150.0 million available to be used by July 31, 2022.\nOur key cash flow metrics were as follows (dollars in millions):\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $153.3 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. While net income increased by $27.6 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020, the increase in cash flows from operating activities was due primarily to a decrease of cash used for net working capital requirements of $120.3 million. Non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation expense increased by $8.4 million, collection of bad debt previously reserved decreased by $2.3 million, income from equity investee decreased by $2.2 million and $5.4 million decrease in the non-cash charges related to the change in our deferred income tax assets. These increases in the cash flow from operating activities were partially offset by the decrease of $11.6 million in previously reserved excess and obsolete inventory.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $292.9 million for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019. While net income increased by $12.4 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019, the decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due primarily to an increase of cash used for net working capital requirements of $281.3 million, including a $181.3 million increase in inventories to meet customer demand, support expected business growth and mitigate supply chain risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic environment. Non-cash charges related to excess and obsolete inventory decreased by $14.6 million, related to bad debt reserve decreased by $10.1 million, related to income (loss) from equity investee decreased by $5.1 million, and related to impairment of investments decreased by $2.7 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. These decreases were offset by an increase of $8.9 million in the non-cash charges related to the change in our deferred income tax assets, unrealized losses on our foreign currency-denominated credit facilities, and depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $58.0 million, $43.6 million and $24.8 million for the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as we invested in our Green Computing Park in San Jose to expand our capacity and office space we purchased and expanded our Bade Facility in Taiwan and made purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $68.2 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily due to an increase of $130.0 million in repurchase of our common stock, partially offset by an increase of $61.9 million in proceeds from borrowings net of repayment. Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $119.6 million for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due to decreased net repayments of debt of $96.4 million, and cash receipts from exercises of stock options of $28.3 million offset by increased cash payments for withholding taxes from the vesting of restricted stock of $5.2 million.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources\n2018 Bank of America Credit Facility\nIn April 2018, we entered into a revolving line of credit with Bank of America for up to $250.0 million (as amended from time to time, the \"2018 Bank of America Credit Facility\"). On June 28, 2021, the 2018 Bank of America Credit Facility was amended to, among other items, extend the maturity to June 28, 2026, reduce the size of the facility from $250.0 million to $200.0 million, increase the maximum amount that we can request the facility be increased (the accordion feature) from $100.0 million to $150.0 million, and update provisions relating to erroneous payments and LIBOR replacement mechanics. In addition, the amendment reduced both the unused line fee from 0.375% per annum to 0.2% or 0.3% per annum (depending upon amount drawn under the facility) and the interest rate applicable to the facility from LIBOR plus 2.00% or 3.00% per annum (depending upon amount drawn under the facility) to LIBOR plus 1.375% or 1.625% per annum. As of June 30, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings. Our available borrowing capacity was $200.0 million, subject to the borrowing base limitation and compliance with other applicable terms. Interest accrued on any loans under the 2018 Bank of America Credit Facility is due on the first day of each month, and the loans are due and payable in full on the termination date of the 2018 Bank of America Credit Facility. Voluntary prepayments are permitted without early repayment fees or penalties. The 2018 Bank of America Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of Super Micro Computer\u2019s assets, other than real property assets. In addition, we are not permitted to pay any dividends. Under the terms of the 2018 Bank of America Credit Facility agreement, we are required to maintain a certain fixed charge ratio and we have been in compliance with all covenants under the 2018 Bank of America Credit Facility.\nCTBC Bank\n2020 CTBC Credit Facility\nIn August 2020, we entered into a credit agreement with CTBC Bank in Taiwan that provides for term loans of up to $50.0 million (the \"2020 CTBC Credit Facility\"), which had a maturity date of August 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding borrowings under the CTBC Credit Facility revolving line of credit were $18.0 million and the interest rates for these loans were 0.98% per annum. The total outstanding borrowings under the CTBC Credit Facility term loan were denominated in NTD and remeasured into U.S. dollars of $25.1 million at June 30, 2021 and the interest rates for these loans were 0.75% per annum. The amount available for future borrowing under the CTBC Credit Facility was $6.9 million as of June 30, 2021. The term loans are secured by certain of our assets, including certain property, plant, and land. There are no financial covenants under the 2020 CTBC Credit Facility.\n2020 CTBC Term Loan Facility due June 4, 2030\nIn May 2020, we entered into a ten-year, non-revolving term loan facility (the \u201c2020 CTBC Term Loan Facility\u201d) to obtain up to NTD 1.2 billion ($40.7 million in U.S. dollar equivalents) in financing for use in the expansion and renovation of our Bade Manufacturing Facility located in Taiwan. Draw downs on the 2020 CTBC Term Loan Facility are based on 80% of balances owed on commercial invoices from the contractor and are drawn according to the progress of the renovations. Borrowings under the 2020 CTBC Term Loan Facility are available through June 2022. We are required to pay against total outstanding principal and interest in equal monthly installments starting June 2023 and continuing through the maturity date of June 2030. The 2020 CTBC Term Loan Facility is secured by the Bade Manufacturing Facility, including any expansion. Fees paid to the lender as debt issuance costs were immaterial. We borrowed $29.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 with a rate of 0.45% per annum. As of June 30, 2021, the amount outstanding under the 2020 CTBC Term Loan Facility was $34.7 million and the net book value of the property serving as collateral was $45.9 million. We have financial covenants\nrequiring our current ratio, debt service coverage ratio, and financial debt ratio, to be maintained at certain levels. As of June 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the 2020 CTBC Term Loan Facility.\n2021 CTBC Credit Lines\nOn July 20, 2021 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), we entered into a general agreement for omnibus credit lines with CTBC Bank, which replaced the 2020 CTBC Credit Facility and 2020 CTBC Term Loan Facility (the \u201cPrior CTBC Credit Lines\u201d) in their entirety and permits borrowings, from time to time, of (i) a term loan facility of up to NTD1,550.0 million ($55.4 million in U.S. dollar equivalents) and (ii) a line of credit facility of up to US$105.0 million (the \u201c2021 CTBC Credit Lines\u201d). Interest rates are to be established according to individual credit arrangements established pursuant to the 2021 CTBC Credit Lines, which interest rates shall be subject to adjustment depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions. Term loans made pursuant to the 2021 CTBC Credit Lines are secured by certain of our assets, including certain property, land, plant, and equipment located in Bade, Taiwan. We are subject to various financial covenants under the 2021 CTBC Credit Lines, including current ratio, debt service coverage ratio, and financial debt ratio requirements. Amounts outstanding under the Prior CTBC Credit Lines on the Effective Date were assumed by the 2021 CTBC Credit Lines.\nE.SUN Credit Facility\nIn December 2020, Super Micro Computer Inc, Taiwan, our wholly-owned Taiwan subsidiary, entered into a General Credit Agreement (the \u201cE.SUN Credit Facility\u201d) with E.SUN Bank in Taiwan. The E.SUN Credit Facility provides for the issuance of loans, advances, acceptances, bills, bank guarantees, overdrafts, letters of credit, and other types of drawdown instruments up to a credit limit of $30.0 million. Terms for specific drawdowns are set forth in separate Notification and Confirmation of Credit Conditions by and between us and E.SUN Bank. The E.SUN Credit Facility expires September 18, 2021. There are no financial covenants associated with the E.SUN Credit Facility. A Notification and Confirmation Agreement was entered into on December 2, 2020 for a $30.0 million import loan (the \u201cImport Loan\u201d) under the E. SUN Credit Facility with a tenor of 120 days bearing interest at a rate based on LIBOR or TAIFX plus a fixed margin. As of June 30, 2021, the amounts outstanding under the E.SUN Credit Facility were $20.4 million and the interest rates for these loans ranged from approximately .0% to1.29% per annum. As of June 30, 2021, the amount available for future borrowing under the E.SUN Credit Facility was $9.6 million.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1, Note 10, \u201cShort-term and Long-term Debt\u201d in our notes to consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.\nCapital Expenditure Requirements\nWe anticipate our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 will be approximately $21.4 million, relating primarily to costs associated in our manufacturing capabilities, including tooling for new products, new information technology investments, and facilities upgrades. We will continue to evaluate new business opportunities and new markets. As a result, our future growth within the existing business or new opportunities and markets may dictate the need for additional facilities and capital expenditures to support that growth. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment.\nWe intend to continue to focus our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 to support the growth of our operations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced software and services offerings, the investments in our office facilities and our systems infrastructure, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings and our planned investments, particularly in our product development efforts, applications or technologies.\nContractual Obligations\nOur estimated future obligations as of June 30, 2021 include both current and long term obligations. For our long-term debt as noted in Part I, Item 1, Note 10, \u201cShort-term and Long-term Debt\u201d, we have a current obligation of $63.5 million and a long-term obligation of $34.7 million. Under our operating leases as noted in Note 12, \"Leases\", we have a current obligation of $6.3 million and a long-term obligation of $14.5 million. As noted in Note 16, \"Commitments and Contingencies\", we have current obligations related to noncancelable purchase commitments of $569.8 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Part II, Item 8, Note 1, \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing the risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in money market funds and certificates of deposit. Our investment in an auction rate security has been classified as non-current due to the lack of a liquid market for these securities. Since our results of operations are not dependent on investments, the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio, and we believe that a 10% change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations. As of June 30, 2021, our investments were in money market funds, certificates of deposits and auction rate securities.\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowings under our term loan and revolving lines of credit. The interest rates for the term loans and the revolving lines of credit ranged from 0.45% to 1.5% at June 30, 2021. Based on the outstanding principal indebtedness of $98.2 million under our credit facilities as of June 30, 2021, we believe that a 10% change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nForeign Currency Risk\nTo date, our international customer and supplier agreements have been denominated primarily in U.S. dollars and accordingly, we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from customer agreements, and do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in the Netherlands and Taiwan is the U.S. dollar. However, certain loans and transactions in these entities are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, and thus we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with re-measurement to U.S. dollars. Such fluctuations have not been significant historically. Foreign exchange (loss) gain for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $(3.2) million, $(1.4) million and $0.5 million, respectively.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Super Micro Computer, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Super Micro Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30,2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated August 27, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInventories - Excess and Obsolescence Reserve - Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company\u2019s inventories are stated at lower of cost, using weighted average cost method, or net realizable value. The Company evaluates inventory on a quarterly basis for excess and obsolescence and lower of cost or net realizable value and, as necessary, writes down the valuation of inventory based upon inventory aging, forecasted usage and sales, anticipated selling price, product obsolescence and other factors.\nWe identified the excess and obsolescence reserve as a critical audit matter because of judgments made by management in determining the reserve rates applied by inventory aging category to estimate the Company\u2019s excess and obsolescence reserve. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company\u2019s reserve rates within its estimation of the inventory excess and obsolescence reserve.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the reserve rates applied to the inventory aging categories to estimate the Company\u2019s excess and obsolescence reserve included the following procedures, among others:\na.We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of the calculation of excess and obsolescence reserve based on the Company\u2019s reserve methodology, including management\u2019s evaluation of the reserve rates by inventory aging category using historical data.\nb.To understand and evaluate the Company\u2019s methodology for determining inventory that is excess or obsolete and the key assumptions and judgments made as part of the process, including the reserve rates, we made inquiries of various personnel in the Company including but not limited to finance and operations personnel about the expected product lifecycles and product development plans.\nc.We involved data specialists to assess management\u2019s estimate on reserve rates by recalculating historical reserve rates across multiple fiscal periods. We compared our independently developed historical reserve rates with the reserve rates used by management.\nd.We tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data utilized in management\u2019s excess and obsolescence reserve, including the classification of inventory by aging category. Then, selected a sample of inventory products and verified the items were properly included in the correct aging category for determination of the reserve rate.\ne.We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communications to management, Company press releases, and industry reports, as well as our observations and inquires as to changes within the business.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Jose, California\nAugust 27, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since fiscal 2003.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(in thousands, except share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (\u201cSuper Micro Computer\u201d) was incorporated in 1993. Super Micro Computer is a global leader in server technology and green computing innovation. Super Micro Computer develops and provides high performance server and storage solutions based upon an innovative, modular and open-standard architecture. Super Micro Computer has operations primarily in the United States, the Netherlands, Taiwan, China and Japan.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The consolidated financial statements of Super Micro Computer include the accounts of Super Micro Computer and entities consolidated under the variable interest model or the voting interest model. Noncontrolling interests are not presented separately in the consolidated statements of operations, and consolidated statements of comprehensive income as the amounts are immaterial. All intercompany accounts and transactions of Super Micro Computer and its consolidated entities (collectively, the \"Company\") have been eliminated in consolidation. For equity investments over which the Company is able to exercise significant influence over the investee but does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee\u2019s activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in equity securities which do not have readily determinable fair values and for which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the measurement alternative which is the cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar securities of the same investee.\nUse of Estimates\nU.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Such estimates include, but are not limited to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns, inventory valuation, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, product warranty accruals, stock-based compensation, impairment of investments and long-lived assets, and income taxes. The Company\u2019s estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and changes in the estimates are recognized prospectively. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considered estimates of the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on its critical and significant accounting estimates, including an assessment of the collectability of each customer contract as part of the revenue recognition process, assessment of the valuation of accounts receivable, assessment of provision for excess and obsolete inventory and an impairment of long-lived assets.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly arms-length transaction between market participants. When measuring fair value, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability that a market participant would consider when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The Company considers one or more techniques for measuring fair value: market approach, income approach, and cost approach. The valuation techniques include inputs that are based on three different levels of observability to the market. The Company categorizes each of its fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n\u2022Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\n\u2022Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and\n\u2022Level 3 - Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nAccounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. Cash equivalents, certificates of deposit and the investment in an auction rate security are carried at fair value. Short-term and long-term debt is carried at amortized cost, which approximates its fair value based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and certificates of deposit with original maturities of less than three months.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash is comprised of amounts held in bank accounts which are controlled by the lenders pursuant to the terms of certain debt agreements, certificates of deposit primarily related to leases and customs requirements, and money market accounts held in escrow pursuant to the Company\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation program. These restricted cash balances have been excluded from the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at lower of cost, using weighted average cost method, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of the Company's products in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Inventories consist of purchased parts and raw materials (principally electronic components), work in process (principally products being assembled) and finished goods. The Company evaluates inventory on a quarterly basis for excess and obsolescence and lower of cost or net realizable value and, as necessary, writes down the valuation of inventories based upon the Company's inventory aging, forecasted usage and sales, anticipated selling price, product obsolescence and other factors. Once inventory is written down, its new value is maintained until it is sold or scrapped.\nThe Company receives various rebate incentives from certain suppliers based on its contractual arrangements, including volume-based rebates. The rebates earned are recognized as a reduction of cost of inventories and reduce the cost of sales in the period when the related inventory is sold.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be measured based on the fair value of the asset compared to the carrying amount. No impairment charge for long-lived assets has been recorded in any of the periods presented.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenues from the sale of server and storage systems, subsystems, accessories, services, server software management solutions, and support services.\nProduct sales. The Company recognizes revenue from sales of products as control is transferred to customers, which generally happens at the point of shipment or upon delivery, unless customer acceptance is uncertain. Products sold by the Company are delivered via shipment from the Company\u2019s facilities or drop shipment directly to its customers from a Company vendor. The Company may use distributors to sell products to end customers. Revenue from distributors is recognized when the distributor obtains control of the product, which generally happens at the point of shipment or upon delivery.\nThe Company applies judgment in determining the transaction price as the Company may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. As part of determining the transaction price in contracts with customers, the Company estimates reserves for future sales returns based on a review of its history of actual returns for each major product line. Based upon historical experience, a refund liability is recorded at the time of sale for estimated product returns and an asset is recognized for the amount expected to be recorded in inventory upon product return, less the expected recovery costs. The Company also reduces revenue for the estimated costs of customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings such as price protection and rebates as well as the estimated costs of cooperative marketing arrangements where the fair value of the benefit derived from the costs cannot be reasonably estimated. Any provision for customer and distributor programs and other discounts is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale based on an evaluation of the contract terms and historical experience.\nServices sales. The Company\u2019s sale of services mainly consists of extended warranty and on-site services. Revenue related to extended warranty commences upon the expiration of the standard warranty period and is recognized ratably over the contractual period as the Company stands ready to perform any required warranty service. Revenue related to on-site services commences upon recognition of the product sale and is recognized ratably over the contractual period as the on-site services are made available to the customer. These service contracts are typically one to five years in length. Service revenue has been less than 10% of net sales for all periods presented and is not separately disclosed.\nContracts with multiple promised goods and services. Certain of the Company\u2019s contracts contain multiple promised goods and services. The Company assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such goods or services are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Performance obligations in a contract are identified based on the promised goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Revenue allocated to each performance obligation is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the promised good or service to a customer.\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company applies judgment to estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information, such as internally approved pricing guidelines with respect to geographies, customer type, internal costs, and gross margin objectives, for the related performance obligations.\nWhen the Company receives consideration from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer, the Company records a contract liability (deferred revenue). The Company also recognizes deferred revenue when it has an unconditional right to consideration (i.e., a receivable) before transfer of control of goods or services to a customer.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe Company considers shipping & handling activities as costs to fulfill the sales of products. Shipping revenue is included in net sales when control of the product is transferred to the customer, and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Taxes imposed by governmental authorities on the Company's revenue producing activities with customers, such as sales taxes and value added taxes, are excluded from net sales and included in operating expenses.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts\nCustomers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates each customer\u2019s financial position and ability and intent to pay. On a quarterly basis, the Company makes estimates of its uncollectible accounts receivable by analyzing the aging of accounts receivable, history of bad debts, customer concentrations, customer-credit-worthiness, and current economic trends to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company's (recovery of) provision for bad debt was $(0.8) million, $(3.1) million, and $7.1 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales primarily consists of the costs of materials, contract manufacturing, in-bound shipping, personnel and related expenses including stock-based compensation, equipment and facility expenses, warranty costs and provision for lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory.\nProduct Warranties\nThe Company offers product warranties typically ranging from 15 to 39 months against any defective products. These standard warranties are assurance type warranties and the Company does not offer any services beyond the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, these warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement. Based on historical experience, the Company accrues for estimated returns of defective products at the time revenue is recognized. The Company monitors warranty obligations and may make revisions to its warranty reserve if actual costs of product repair and replacement are significantly higher or lower than estimated. Accruals for anticipated future warranty costs are recorded to cost of sales and included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. Warranty accruals are based on estimates that are updated on an ongoing basis taking into consideration inputs such as new product introductions, changes in the volume of claims compared with the Company's historical experience, and the changes in the cost of servicing warranty claims. The Company accounts for the effect of such changes in estimates prospectively. The following table presents for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the reconciliation of the changes in accrued warranty costs which is included as a component of accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities (in thousands):\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of personnel expenses including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and incentive bonuses, and related expenses for the Company's research and development personnel, as well as materials and supplies, consulting services, third-party testing services and equipment and facility expenses related to the Company's research and development activities. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company occasionally receives funding from certain suppliers and customers towards its development efforts. Such amounts are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses and were $10.9 million, $2.1 million, and $2.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company also recorded a\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n$9.5 million net settlement fee as a reduction in the research and development expenses related to the reimbursement of previously incurred expenses for one canceled joint product development agreement.\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, that are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized if significant. Costs incurred during the application development stage for internal-use software are capitalized if significant. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line amortization method over the estimated useful life of the applicable software. Such software development costs required to be capitalized have not been material to date.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs, net of reimbursements received under the cooperative marketing arrangements with the Company's vendors, are expensed as incurred. Total advertising and promotional expenses were $4.1 million, $3.0 million and $2.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and non-employees, including stock options, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d). The Company recognizes the grant date fair value of all share-based awards over the requisite service period and accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock option and RSU awards are recognized to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. PRSU awards are recognized to expense using an accelerated method only when it is probable that a performance condition is met during the vesting period. If it is not probable, no expense is recognized and the previously recognized expense is reversed. The Company bases initial accrual of compensation expense on the estimated number of PRSUs that are expected to vest over the requisite service period. That estimate is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of PRSUs is likely to differ from previous estimates. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of PRSUs expected to vest is recognized in stock-based compensation expense in the period of the change. Previously recognized compensation expense is not reversed if vested stock options, RSUs or PRSUs for which the requisite service has been rendered and the performance condition has been met expire unexercised or are not settled.\nThe fair value of RSUs and PRSUs is based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option and the expected volatility of the price of the Company's common stock. The expected term represents the period that the Company\u2019s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on the Company's historical experience. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.\nLeases\nThe Company has arrangements for the right to use certain of its office, warehouse spaces and other premises, and equipment. The Company determines at inception if an arrangement is or contains a lease. When the terms of a lease effectively transfer control of the underlying asset to the Company, it is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\nOperating Leases\nFor operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months, operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets are recorded in long-term other assets, and lease liabilities are recorded in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company's lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. The Company elected to apply the short-term lease recognition exemption and does not recognize ROU asset and lease liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and recognizes as expense the payments under such leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company's leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are immaterial.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nOperating lease ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate implicit in the lease arrangements is not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to be the interest rate on a fully collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in the economic environment where the leased asset is located. Operating lease ROU assets also include initial direct costs incurred, prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company accounts for fixed payments for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component which increases the amount of ROU assets and liabilities. Non-lease components that are variable costs, such as common area maintenance, are expensed as incurred and not included in the ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nFinance Leases\nAssets under finance leases are recorded in property, plant and equipment, net and lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Finance lease interest expense is recognized based on an effective interest method and depreciation of assets is recorded on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the asset. The Company's finance leases are immaterial.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for income tax reporting purposes, net of operating loss carry-forwards and other tax credits measured by applying enacted tax laws related to the financial statement periods. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires the Company to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in applicable tax law, settlement of issues under audit and new exposures. If the Company later determines that its exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover its revised expectations, the Company adjusts the liability and effects a related charge in its tax provision during the period in which the Company makes such a determination.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company determines at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which the Company holds an investment or in which the Company has other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). The Company consolidates VIEs when it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company assesses whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity affect the determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, the Company accounts for the investment or other variable interest in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nThe Company has concluded that Ablecom Technology, Inc. (\u201cAblecom\u201d) and its affiliate, Compuware Technology, Inc. (\"Compuware\"), are VIEs; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct the activities that are most significant to the entities and therefore, the Company does not consolidate these entities. In performing its analysis, the Company considered its explicit arrangements with Ablecom and Compuware, all contractual arrangements with these entities. Also, as a result of the substantial related party relationships between the Company and these entities, the Company considered whether any implicit arrangements exist that would cause the Company to protect these related parties\u2019\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\ninterests from suffering losses. The Company determined it has no material implicit arrangements with Ablecom, Compuware or their shareholders.\nThe Company and Ablecom jointly established Super Micro Asia Science and Technology Park, Inc. (the \"Management Company\") in Taiwan to manage the common areas shared by the Company and Ablecom for its separately constructed manufacturing facilities. In fiscal year 2012, each party contributed $0.2 million for a 50% ownership interest of the Management Company. The Company has concluded that the Management Company is a VIE, and the Company is the primary beneficiary as it has the power to direct the activities that are most significant to the Management Company. For the fiscal years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019, the accounts of the Management Company were consolidated with the accounts of Super Micro Computer, and a noncontrolling interest was recorded for Ablecom's interest in the net assets and operations of the Management Company. Net income (loss) attributable to Ablecom's interest was not material for the periods presented and was included in general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nThe functional currency of the Company\u2019s international subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, with the exception of Super Micro Asia and Technology Park, Inc., a consolidated variable interest entity. Monetary assets and liabilities of the Company's international subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in the foreign currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the historical rates. Revenue and expenses that are denominated in the foreign currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the period. Remeasurement of foreign currency accounts and resulting foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, which have not been material, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in other expense, net.\nThe functional currency of Super Micro Asia and Technology Park, Inc. is New Taiwanese Dollar (\u201cNTD\u201d). Assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rate. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. The effects of foreign currency translation are included in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and periodic movements are summarized as a line item in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThe Company has an investment in a privately-held company that is accounted for under the equity method (the \"Corporate Venture\"). The functional currency of the Corporate Venture is the Chinese Yuan. Adjustments for the Company's share of the effects of foreign currency translation from local currency to U.S. dollars are recorded as increases or decreases to the carrying value of the investment and included in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and periodic movements are summarized as a line item in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nNet Income Per Common Share\nBasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options and unvested RSUs and PRSUs. Contingently issuable shares are included in computing basic net income per common share as of the date that all necessary conditions, including service vesting conditions have been satisfied. Contingently issuable shares are considered for computing diluted net income per common share as of the beginning of the period in which all necessary conditions have been satisfied and the only remaining vesting condition is a service vesting condition.\nUnder the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company's common stock results in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding stock options and RSUs and PRSUs. Additionally, the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs results in a further dilutive effect on net income per share.\nThe computation of basic and diluted net income per common share is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company had stock options, RSUs and PRSUs outstanding that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share in the periods presented, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The anti-dilutive common share equivalents resulting from outstanding equity awards were 670,179, 2,208,000, and 3,758,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nConcentration of Supplier Risk\nCertain materials used by the Company in the manufacturing of its products are available from a limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these materials due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. One supplier accounted for 20.3%, 26.8%, and 21.8% of total purchases for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Purchases from Ablecom and Compuware, related parties of the Company as noted in Note 13, \"Related Party Transactions,\" accounted for a combined 7.8%, 10.1%, and 9.2% of total cost of sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, investment in an auction rate security and accounts receivable. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the net sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. One customer accounted for 13.5% and 10.1% of accounts receivable, net as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method. Upon the retirement of treasury shares, the Company deducts the par value of the retired treasury shares from common stock and allocates the excess of cost over par as a deduction to additional paid-in capital based on the pro-rata portion of additional paid-in-capital, and the remaining excess as a deduction to retained earnings. Retired treasury shares revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares.\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under this new guidance, a company is required to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments using an expected-loss model, replacing the current incurred-loss model, and record the estimate through an allowance for credit losses, which results in more timely recognition of credit losses. The Company adopted this guidance on July 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective transition method, which requires a cumulative-effect adjustment, if any, to the opening balance of retained earnings to be recognized on the date of adoption with prior periods not restated. The adoption of the guidance had no material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of July 1, 2020.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable and the investment in an auction rate security. The allowance for credit losses is estimated using a loss rate method, considering factors such as customers\u2019 credit risk, historical loss experience, current conditions, and forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis by aggregating customer balances with similar risk characteristics. The Company also records a specific allowance based on an analysis of individual past due balances or customer-specific information, such as a decline in creditworthiness or bankruptcy. The new guidance has no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance, Fair Value Measurement: Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements based on the concepts in the FASB Concepts Statements, including the consideration of costs and benefits. The Company adopted this guidance on July 1, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, the Company\u2019s investment in an auction rate security is the only Level 3 investment measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Changes to the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements were immaterial. See Note 2, \"Fair Value Disclosure\".\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract as well as hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the new guidance. The Company adopted this guidance on July 1, 2020, prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued amended guidance, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, to remove certain exceptions to the general principles from ASC 740 - Income Taxes, and to improve consistent application of U.S. GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The guidance is effective for the Company from July 1, 2021; early adoption is permitted. The Company determined that the adoption of the guidance will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued authoritative guidance, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance also establishes (1) a general contract modification principle that entities can apply in other areas that may be affected by reference rate reform and (2) certain elective hedge accounting expedients. The amendment is effective for all entities through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued further guidance on this topic, which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance. LIBOR is used to calculate the interest on borrowings under the Company's 2018 Bank of America Credit Facility and E.SUN Credit Facility. The 2018 Bank of America Credit Facility was amended on June 28, 2021 with a new maturity date of June 28, 2026 and fallback terms related to LIBOR replacement mechanics. As the amendment has changes not related to LIBOR replacement, optional expedients under this guidance cannot be elected. E.SUN Credit Facility will terminate on September 18, 2021 before the phase out of LIBOR. Therefore, the Company does not expect the adoption of the guidance to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nNote 2. Fair Value Disclosure\nThe financial instruments of the Company measured at fair value on a recurring basis are included in cash equivalents, other assets and accrued liabilities. The Company classifies its financial instruments, except for its investment in an auction rate security, within Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company uses quoted prices in active markets or alternative pricing sources and models using market observable inputs to determine their fair value.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe Company\u2019s investment in an auction rate security is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the determination of its fair value was not based on observable inputs as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. See Note 1, \"Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" for a discussion of the Company\u2019s policies regarding the fair value hierarchy. The Company is using the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the auction rate security at each period end and the following assumptions: (i) the expected yield based on observable market rate of similar securities, (ii) the security coupon rate that is reset monthly, (iii) the estimated holding period and (iv) a liquidity discount. The liquidity discount assumption is based on the management estimate of lack of marketability discount of similar securities and is determined based on the analysis of financial market trends over time, recent redemptions of securities and other market activities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis and applying a change of either plus or minus 100 basis points in the liquidity discount does not result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement of the auction rate security as of June 30, 2021.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table sets forth the Company\u2019s financial instruments as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy. These are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement (in thousands):\n__________________________\n(1) $0.0 million and $0.4 million in money market funds are included in cash and cash equivalents and $0.2 million and $0.8 million in money market funds are included in restricted cash, non-current in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(2) $0.2 million and $0.2 million in certificates of deposit are included in cash and cash equivalents, $0.3 million and $0.3 million in certificates of deposit are included in prepaid expenses and other assets, and $0.4 million and $0.3 million in certificates of deposit are included in restricted cash, non-current in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(3) As of June 30, 2021, the Company no longer measures performance awards liability at fair value because the Company trued up the performance awards liability to the cash payment value. As of June 30, 2020, the current portion of the performance awards liability of $1.5 million is included in accrued liabilities and the noncurrent portion of $0.6 million is included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company also evaluates the current expected credit loss by considering factors such as historical experience, market data, issuer-specific factors, and current economic conditions. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the credit losses related to the Company\u2019s investments was not significant.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nAs of June 30, 2020, the Company estimated the fair value of performance awards using the Monte-Carlo simulation model and classified them within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as estimates are based on the observable inputs. The significant inputs used in estimating the fair value of the awards as of June 30, 2020 are as follows:\nThere was no movement in the balances of the Company's financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, consisting of investment in an auction rate security, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 financial instruments in fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nThe following is a summary of the Company\u2019s investment in an auction rate security as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company's loss recognized in other comprehensive income for the auction rate security was immaterial. No gain or loss was recognized in other comprehensive income for the auction rate security for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company measures the fair value of outstanding debt for disclosure purposes on a recurring basis. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, total debt of $98.2 million and $29.4 million, respectively, is reported at amortized cost. This outstanding debt is classified as Level 2 as it is not actively traded. The amortized cost of the outstanding debt approximates the fair value.\nOther Financial Assets - Investments into Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nThe Company's non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values in the amount of $0.1 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company accounts for these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments by the same issuer. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not record any upward or downward adjustments to the carrying values of the non-marketable equity securities related to observable price changes. The Company also did not record any impairment to the carrying values of the non-marketable equity securities during fiscal year 2021 and 2020. During fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $2.7 million for its non-marketable equity securities which had an initial cost basis of $2.7 million as it was determined the carrying value of the investments were not recoverable.\nNote 3. Revenue\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company disaggregates revenue by type of product and geographical market in order to depict the nature, amount, and timing of revenue and cash flows. Service revenues, which are less than 10%, are not a significant component of total revenue and are aggregated within the respective categories.\nThe following is a summary of net sales by product type (in thousands):\nServer and storage systems constitute an assembly and integration of subsystems and accessories, and related services.\nSubsystems and accessories are comprised of serverboards, chassis and accessories.\nInternational net sales are based on the country and geographical region to which the products were shipped. The following is a summary of net sales by geographic region (in thousands):\nStarting July 1, 2020, the Company does not separately disclose revenue by products sold to indirect sales channel partners or direct customers and original equipment manufacturers because management does not make business operational decisions based on this set of disaggregation so the disclosure is no longer material to investors.\nContract Balances\nGenerally, the payment terms of the Company\u2019s offerings range from 30 to 60 days. In certain instances, customers may prepay for products and services in advance of delivery. Receivables relate to the Company\u2019s unconditional right to consideration for performance obligations either partially or fully completed.\nContract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer when such right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Such contract assets are insignificant to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and relate to amounts invoiced to or advance consideration received from customers, which precede the Company\u2019s satisfaction of the associated performance obligation(s). The Company\u2019s deferred revenue primarily results from customer payments received upfront for extended warranties and on-site services because these performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue recognized during fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, which was included in the opening deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2020 of $203.8 million, was $101.6 million.\nDeferred revenue decreased $1.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 mainly due to the recognition of revenue from contracts entered into in prior periods exceeding the value of the transaction price allocated for service contract performance obligations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nRemaining performance obligations represent the aggregate the amount of transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or only partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. The Company applies the exemption to not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. These performance obligations generally consist of services, such as on-site services, including integration services and extended warranty services. that are contracted for one year or less, and products for which control has not yet been transferred. The value of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations as of June 30, 2021 was approximately $202.3 million. The Company expects to recognize approximately 50% of remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next 12 months, and the remainder thereafter.\nCapitalized Contract Acquisition Costs and Fulfillment Cost\nContract acquisition costs are those incremental costs that the Company incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. Contract acquisition costs consist primarily of incentive bonuses. Contract acquisition costs are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract with a customer and are therefore capitalizable. The Company applies the practical expedient to expense incentive bonus costs as incurred if the amortization period would be one year or less, generally upon delivery of the associated server and storage systems or components. Where the amortization period of the contract cost would be more than a year, the Company applies judgment in the allocation of the incentive bonus cost asset between hardware and service performance obligations and expenses the cost allocated to the hardware performance obligations upon delivery of associated server and storage systems or components and amortizes the cost allocated to service performance obligations over the period the services are expected to be provided. Contract acquisition costs allocated to service performance obligations that are subject to capitalization are insignificant to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nContract fulfillment costs consist of costs paid in advance for outsourced services provided by third parties to the extent they are not in the scope of other guidance. Fulfillment costs paid in advance for outsourced services provided by third parties are capitalized and amortized over the period the services are expected to be provided. Such fulfillment costs are insignificant to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nNote 4. Accounts Receivable Allowances\nThe Company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the age of outstanding receivables, credit risk of specific customers, historical trends related to past losses and other relevant factors. Accounts receivable allowances as of June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nNote 5. Inventories\nInventories as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nDuring fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a net provision for excess and obsolete inventory to cost of sales totaling $6.8 million, $18.4 million and $32.9 million, respectively. The Company classifies subsystems and accessories that may be sold separately or incorporated into systems as finished goods.\nNote 6. Property, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):\n__________________________\n(1) Primarily relates to the development and construction costs associated with the Company\u2019s Green Computing Park located in San Jose, California and a new building in Taiwan.\nNote 7. Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):\n__________________________\n(1) Includes other receivables from contract manufacturers based on certain buy-sell arrangements of $76.2 million and $83.8 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nOther assets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nNote 8. Investment in a Corporate Venture\nIn October 2016, the Company entered into agreements pursuant to which the Company contributed certain technology rights in connection with an investment in the Corporate Venture to expand the Company's presence in China. The Corporate Venture is 30% owned by the Company and 70% owned by another company in China. The transaction was closed in the third fiscal quarter of 2017 and the investment has been accounted for using the equity method. As such, the Corporate Venture is also a related party.\nThe Company recorded a deferred gain related to the contribution of certain technology rights. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had unamortized deferred gain balance of $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in accrued liabilities and $0.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in other long-term liabilities in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company monitors the investment for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values if it determines that an impairment charge is required. In June 2020, the third-party parent company that controls the Corporate Venture was placed on a U.S. government export control list, along with\nseveral of such third-party parent's related entities and a separate listing for one of its subsidiaries. The Corporate Venture is not itself a restricted party. The Company has concluded that the Corporate Venture is in compliance with the new restrictions. The Company does not believe that the equity investment carrying value is impacted as of June 30, 2021. No impairment charge was recorded for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Company sold products worth $51.2 million, $61.9 million, $52.2 million to the Corporate Venture in the fiscal years 2021, 2020, 2019, respectively, and the Company's share of intra-entity profits on the products that remained unsold by the Corporate Venture as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 have been eliminated and have reduced the carrying value of the Company's investment in the Corporate Venture. To the extent that the elimination of intra-entity profits reduces the investment balance below zero, such amounts are recorded within accrued liabilities. The Company had $8.5 million and $7.8 million due from the Corporate Venture in accounts receivable, net as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNote 9. Accrued Liabilities\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nAccrued liabilities as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nPerformance Awards Liability\nIn March 2020, the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) approved performance bonuses for the Chief Executive Officer, a senior executive and two members of the Board, which payments will be earned when specified market and performance conditions are achieved.\nThe Chief Executive Officer\u2019s aggregate cash bonuses of up to $8.1 million are earned in two tranches. The first 50% is payable if the average closing price for the Company\u2019s common stock equals or exceeds $31.61 for any period of 20 consecutive trading days following the date of the agreement and ending prior to September 30, 2021 and the Chief Executive Officer remains employed with the Company through the date that such common stock price goal is determined to have been achieved. This payment can be reduced at the discretion of the Board to the extent the Company has not made adequate progress in remediating its material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as determined by the Board. The second 50% is payable if the average closing price for the Company\u2019s common stock equals or exceeds $32.99 for any period of 20 consecutive trading days following the date of the agreement and ending prior to June 30, 2022 and the Chief Executive Officer remains employed with the Company through the date that such common stock price goal is achieved. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the target average closing prices for both tranches were met but no determination has been made if there has been adequate progress in remediating the Company\u2019s internal weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The cash payment under the second tranche has been made as of June 30, 2021, but no cash payment had been made for the first tranche as the Board has to approve this payment.\nPerformance bonuses for a senior executive and two members of the Board are earned based on achieving a specified target average closing price for the Company\u2019s common stock over the specified period as determined by the Board at the grant dates and continuous services through the payment dates. A senior executive earned an aggregate cash payment of $0.1 million when the target average closing price was met in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. The two members of the Board can earn aggregate cash payments of $0.3 million in two tranches if the target average closing price reaches $31.61 for the first tranche and $32.99 per share for the second tranche. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the target average closing prices for both tranches were met and the cash payment for both tranches was made to the two Board members.\nThe Company accounts for the outstanding performance bonuses as liabilities and estimates fair value of payable amounts using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The awards are re-measured at each period end with changes in fair value recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses. The cumulative recorded expense at each period end is trued-up to the expected payable amount vested through the period end. The requisite service periods over which expenses are recognized are derived from the Monte-Carlo model for all performance awards, except for the first 50% of the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s award that includes a performance condition. The Company estimates if it is probable that the performance condition will be met prior to the expiration date of this award. If at the measurement date it is determined to be probable, the Company estimates the requisite period as the longer of the service period derived by the Monte-Carlo model and the implicit service period when the Company expects to make adequate progress in remediating its material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, as reported by the Company's Audit Committee. If it is determined to not be probable,\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nthen the Company will reverse any previously recognized expense for this award in the period when it is no longer probable that the performance condition will be achieved.\nWith the satisfaction of the target average closing price conditions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company trued up all the unpaid performance bonuses to the cash payment value. As of June 30, 2021, the full cash value of the bonuses were paid, except the Chief Executive Officer's first tranche performance bonus which was recorded as an accrued liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company has completed the remediation of its material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, and anticipates that the Board will conclude that there has been adequate progress in remediating the Company's material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting by October 31, 2021. Therefore, as of June 30, 2021, the Company trued up the accrued liability for the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s first tranche award to the expected payable amount vested through the period end and the unrecognized cash value will be recorded over the remaining service period.\nBased on the cash payment value and estimated fair value of these performance bonuses as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the Company recorded a $3.6 million and $2.1 million liability, respectively, of which $3.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, was recorded within accrued liabilities and $0.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively, was recorded within other long-term liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. An unrecognized compensation expense of $0.5 million will be recorded over the remaining service periods of 0.18 years.

See Note 13, \"Related Party Transactions\" for a further discussion.\nNote 13. Related Party Transactions\nThe Company has a variety of business relationships with Ablecom and Compuware. Ablecom and Compuware are both Taiwan corporations. Ablecom is one of the Company\u2019s major contract manufacturers; Compuware is both a distributor of the Company\u2019s products and a contract manufacturer for the Company. Ablecom\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Liang, is the brother of Charles Liang, the Company\u2019s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Steve Liang and his family members owned approximately 28.8% of Ablecom\u2019s stock and Charles Liang and his spouse, Sara Liu, who is also an officer and director of the Company, collectively owned approximately 10.5% of Ablecom\u2019s capital stock as of June 30, 2021. Bill Liang, a brother of both Charles Liang and Steve Liang, is a member of the Board of Directors of Ablecom. Bill Liang is also the Chief Executive Officer of Compuware, a member of Compuware\u2019s Board of Directors and a holder of a significant equity interest in Compuware. Steve Liang is also a member of Compuware\u2019s Board of Directors and is an equity holder of Compuware. Charles Liang or Sara Liu do not own any capital stock of Compuware and the Company does not own any of Ablecom or Compuware's capital stock.\nDealings with Ablecom\nThe Company has entered into a series of agreements with Ablecom, including multiple product development, production and service agreements, product manufacturing agreements, manufacturing services agreements and lease agreements for warehouse space.\nUnder these agreements, the Company outsources to Ablecom a portion of its design activities and a significant part of its server chassis manufacturing as well as an immaterial portion of other components. Ablecom manufactured approximately 91.8%, 95.5% and 96.3% of the chassis included in the products sold by the Company during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. With respect to design activities, Ablecom generally agrees to design certain agreed-upon products according to the Company\u2019s specifications, and further agrees to build the tools needed to manufacture the products. The Company pays Ablecom for the design and engineering services, and further agrees to pay Ablecom for the tooling. The Company retains full ownership of any intellectual property resulting from the design of these products and tooling.\nWith respect to the manufacturing aspects of the relationship, Ablecom purchases most of materials needed to manufacture the chassis from third parties and the Company provides certain components used in the manufacturing process (such as power supplies) to Ablecom through consignment or sales transactions. Ablecom uses these materials and components to manufacture the completed chassis and then sell them back to the Company. For the components purchased from the Company, Ablecom sells the components back to the Company at a price equal to the price at which the Company sold the components to Ablecom. The Company and Ablecom frequently review and negotiate the prices of the chassis the Company purchases from Ablecom. In addition to inventory purchases, the Company also incurs other costs associated with design services, tooling and other miscellaneous costs from Ablecom.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to financial loss as a result of its involvement with Ablecom is limited to potential losses on its purchase orders in the event of an unforeseen decline in the market price and/or demand of the Company\u2019s products such that the Company incurs a loss on the sale or cannot sell the products. Outstanding purchase orders from the Company to Ablecom were $40.2 million and $23.2 million at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing the maximum exposure to financial loss. The Company does not directly or indirectly guarantee any obligations of Ablecom, or any losses that the equity holders of Ablecom may suffer. Since Ablecom manufactures substantially all the chassis that the Company incorporates into its products, if Ablecom were to suddenly be unable to manufacture chassis for the Company, the Company\u2019s business could suffer if the Company is unable to quickly qualify substitute suppliers who can supply high-quality chassis to the Company in volume and at acceptable prices.\nDealings with Compuware\nThe Company has entered into a distribution agreement with Compuware, under which the Company appointed Compuware as a non-exclusive distributor of the Company\u2019s products in Taiwan, China and Australia. Compuware assumes the responsibility to install the Company's products at the site of the end customer, if required, and administers customer support in exchange for a discount from the Company's standard price for its purchases.\nThe Company also has entered into a series of agreements with Compuware, including a multiple product development, production and service agreements, product manufacturing agreements, and lease agreements for office space.\nUnder these agreements, the Company outsources to Compuware a portion of its design activities and a significant part of its power supplies manufacturing as well as an immaterial portion of other components. With respect to design activities, Compuware generally agrees to design certain agreed-upon products according to the Company\u2019s specifications, and further agrees to build the tools needed to manufacture the products. The Company pays Compuware for the design and engineering services, and further agrees to pay Compuware for the tooling. The Company retains full ownership of any intellectual property resulting from the design of these products and tooling. With respect to the manufacturing aspects of the relationship, Compuware purchases most of materials needed to manufacture the power supplies from outside markets and uses these materials to manufacture the products and then sell those products to the Company. The Company and Compuware frequently review and negotiate the prices of the power supplies the Company purchases from Compuware.\nCompuware also manufactures motherboards, backplanes and other components used on printed circuit boards for the Company. The Company sells to Compuware most of the components needed to manufacture the above products. Compuware uses the components to manufacture the products and then sells the products back to the Company at a purchase price equal to the price at which the Company sold the components to Compuware, plus a \u201cmanufacturing value added\u201d fee and other miscellaneous material charges and costs. The Company and Compuware frequently review and negotiate the amount of the \u201cmanufacturing value added\u201d fee that will be included in the price of the products the Company purchases from Compuware. In addition to the inventory purchases, the Company also incurs costs associated with design services, tooling assets, and miscellaneous costs.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to financial loss as a result of its involvement with Compuware is limited to potential losses on its purchase orders in the event of an unforeseen decline in the market price and/or demand of the Company\u2019s products such that the Company incurs a loss on the sale or cannot sell the products. Outstanding purchase orders from the Company to Compuware were $71.0 million and $45.7 million at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing the maximum exposure to financial loss. The Company does not directly or indirectly guarantee any obligations of Compuware, or any losses that the equity holders of Compuware may suffer.\nThe Company\u2019s results from transactions with Ablecom and Compuware for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n__________________________\n(1) Includes principally purchases of inventory and other miscellaneous items.\nThe Company's net sales to Ablecom were not material for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company had the following balances related to transactions with Ablecom and Compuware as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n__________________________\n(1) Other receivables include receivables from vendors included in prepaid and other current assets.\n(2) Includes current portion of operating lease liabilities included in other current liabilities.\n(3) Represents non-current portion of operating lease liabilities.\nThe Company procures certain semiconductor products from Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (\u201cMPS\u201d), a fabless manufacturer of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, for use in its products. Saria Tseng, who serves as a member on the Board of Directors, also serves as Vice President of Strategic Corporate Development, General Counsel and Secretary of MPS. The Company purchased $3.9 million, $5.2 million and $3.7 million of semiconductor products from MPS for use in its manufacturing process during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts due to MPS as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 were not material.\nSee Note 8, \"Investment in a Corporate Venture\" for a discussion of the investment and the transactions and balances in the Company's Corporate Venture.\nNote 14. Stock-based Compensation and Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nEquity Incentive Plan\nOn June 5, 2020, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the \"2020 Plan\"). The maximum number of shares available under the 2020 Plan is 5,000,000 plus 1,045,000 shares of common stock that remained available for future awards under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d), at the time of adoption of the 2020 Plan. No other awards can be granted under the 2016 Plan and 7,246,000 shares of common stock remain reserved for outstanding awards issued under the 2016 Plan at the time of adoption of the 2020 Plan.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nUnder the 2020 Plan, the Company can grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, dividend equivalents, and certain other awards, including those denominated or payable in, or otherwise based on, the Company\u2019s common stock. The exercise price per share for incentive stock options granted to employees owning shares representing more than 10% of the Company's outstanding voting stock at the time of grant cannot be less than 110% of the fair value of the underlying shares on the grant date. Nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options granted to all other persons are granted at a price not less than 100% of the fair value. Options generally expire ten years after the date of grant. Stock options and RSUs generally vest over four years; 25% at the end of one year and one sixteenth per quarter thereafter.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had 2,730,277 authorized shares available for future issuance under the 2020 Plan.\nCommon Stock Repurchase and Retirement\nOn August 9, 2020, the Board approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $30.0 million of the Company's common stock at market prices. The program was effective until December 31, 2020 or if earlier, until the maximum amount of common stock is repurchased. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, 1,142,294 shares of common stock were repurchased for $30.0 million and the program ended. Repurchased shares were recorded as treasury shares in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020.\nOn December 11, 2020, the Company retired 2,475,419 shares of common stock, which were recorded as treasury stock in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020.\nOn October 31, 2020, the Board approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of the Company's common stock at market prices. The program was effective until October 31, 2021 or if earlier, until the maximum amount of common stock was repurchased. As of March 31, 2021, 1,675,746 shares of common stock were repurchased and retired for an aggregate $50.0 million and the program ended.\nOn January 29, 2021, a duly authorized subcommittee of the Board approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $200.0 million of the Company's common stock at market prices. The program is effective until July 31, 2022 or if earlier, until the maximum amount of common stock is repurchased. 1,391,171 shares of common stock were repurchased and retired for an aggregate $50.0 million as of June 30, 2021.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company repurchased and retired 4,209,211 shares of common stock for an aggregated $130.0 million. Additionally, the Company retired 1,333,125 shares of common stock repurchased in prior years.\nDetermining Fair Value\nThe Company's fair value of RSUs and PRSUs is based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-option-pricing model. This fair value is then amortized ratably over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. The key inputs in using the Black-Scholes-option-pricing model were as follows:\nExpected Term-The Company\u2019s expected term represents the period that the Company\u2019s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on the Company's historical experience.\nExpected Volatility-Expected volatility is based on the Company's implied and historical volatility.\nExpected Dividend-The Black-Scholes valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input and the Company has no plans to pay dividends.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method is based on the United States Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.\nThe fair value of stock option grants for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe following table shows total stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nAs of June 30, 2021, $8.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4 years, $45.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.73 years and $0.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested PRSUs is expected to be recognized over a period of 0.36 year. Additionally, as described below, $10.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2021 CEO Performance Stock Option is expected to be recognized over a period of 5 years.\nStock Option Activity\nIn March 2021, the Company\u2019s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) approved the grant of a stock option award for 1,000,000 shares of common stock to the Company\u2019s CEO (the \u201c2021 CEO Performance Stock Option\u201d). The 2021 CEO Performance Stock Option has five vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming (1) continued employment either as the CEO or in such capacity as agreed upon between the Company\u2019s CEO and the Board and (2) service through each vesting date. Each of the five vesting tranches of the 2021 CEO Performance Stock Option will vest upon certification by the Compensation Committee that both (i) the market price milestone for such tranche, which begins at $45.00 per share for the first tranche and increases up to $120.00 per share thereafter (based on a 60 calendar day average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of five operational milestones focused on total revenue, as reported under U.S. GAAP, have been achieved for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $45.00 per share, prior to March 2, 2024, the Company\u2019s CEO must hold shares that he acquires until March 2, 2024, other than those shares sold pursuant to a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\nThe achievement status of the operational and stock price milestones as of June 30, 2021 was as follows:\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nOn the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed expense amount for such tranche and (ii) the future time when the market price milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved, or its \u201cexpected market price milestone achievement time.\u201d Separately, based on a subjective assessment of the Company\u2019s future financial performance, each quarter, the Company will determine whether achievement is probable for each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement, and, if so, the future time when the Company expects to achieve that operational milestone, or its \u201cexpected operational milestone achievement time.\u201d When the Company first determines that an operational milestone has become probable of being achieved, the Company will allocate the entire expense for the related tranche over the number of quarters between the grant date and the then-applicable \u201cexpected vesting time.\u201d The \u201cexpected vesting time\u201d at any given time is the later of (i) the expected operational milestone achievement time (if the related operational milestone has not yet been achieved) and (ii) the expected market price milestone achievement time (if the related market price milestone has not yet been achieved). The Company will immediately recognize a catch-up expense for all accumulated expenses from the grant date through the quarter in which the operational milestone was first deemed probable of being achieved. Each quarter thereafter, the Company will recognize the prorated portion of the then-remaining expense for the tranche based on the number of quarters between such quarter and the then-applicable expected vesting time, except that upon vesting of a tranche, all remaining expenses for that tranche will be immediately recognized.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized compensation expense related to the 2021 CEO Performance Stock Option of $1.1 million. As of June 30, 2021, $10.5 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2021 CEO Performance Stock Option is expected to be recognized over a period of 5 years.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 under all plans:\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe total pretax intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $24.3 million, $19.3 million and $0, respectively. Additional information regarding options outstanding as of June 30, 2021, is as follows:\nRSU and PRSU Activity\nIn January 2015, the Company began to grant RSUs to employees. The Company grants RSUs to certain employees as part of its regular employee equity compensation review program as well as to selected new hires. RSUs are typically service based share awards that entitle the holder to receive freely tradable shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting.\nIn August 2017, the Compensation Committee granted two PRSU awards to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, both of which have both performance and service conditions. 50% of the PRSUs vested at June 30, 2018 when performance conditions were achieved, while the remainder vest in equal amounts over the following ten quarters subject to the continued employment of the CEO. As of June 30, 2021, the remaining 50% of the PRSUs had vested in accordance with the terms of the grant.\nIn March 2020, the Compensation Committee granted a PRSU award to one of the Company's senior executives. The award vests in two tranches and includes service and performance conditions. Each tranche has 15,000 RSUs that vest in May 2021 and November 2021 based on service conditions only. Additional units can be earned based on revenue growth percentage in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, which units would vest in May 2021, and based on revenue growth percentage in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, which units would vest in November 2021. No additional units were earned for fiscal year 2020 as revenue decreased from fiscal year 2019.\nThe following table summarizes RSUs and PRSUs activity during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 under all plans:\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n_________________\n(1) The number of shares released excludes 172,857 RSUs that were vested but not released in fiscal year 2019. The number of vested but not released RSUs for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was not material. The number of shares released also excludes 24,000 PRSUs that were vested but not released in fiscal year 2019. These vested RSUs and PRSUs were primarily released in fiscal year 2020 and included in fiscal year 2020 number upon the effectiveness of the Company's registration statement on Form S-8.\nThe total pretax intrinsic value of RSUs and PRSUs vested was $32.6 million, $18.9 million and $14.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company withheld 274,620, 331,648 and 175,044 shares with value equivalent to the employees' minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes from the vesting and release of 1,011,406, 979,274 and 549,886 RSUs and PRSUs, respectively, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company's closing stock price. Total payments for the employees' tax obligations to tax authorities were $8.7 million, $8.2 million and $3.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. Pursuant to the terms of the 2020 and 2016 Plan, shares withheld in connection with net-share settlements are returned to the 2016 Plan and are available for future grants under the 2020 and 2016 Plan.\nNote 15. Income Taxes\nThe components of income before income tax provision for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nThe income tax provision for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, consists of the following (in thousands):\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 consist of the following (in thousands):\nThe Company assesses its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a regular basis, and where applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future. As of June 30, 2021, the Company believes that most of its deferred tax assets are \u201cmore-likely-than not\u201d to be realized with the exception of state research and development tax credits that have not met the \u201cmore-likely than not\u201d realization threshold criteria. As a result, at June 30, 2021, the gross excess credits of $37.1 million, or net of federal tax benefit of $29.3 million, are subject to a full valuation allowance. At June 30, 2020, the gross excess credits of $30.8 million, or net of federal tax benefit of $24.3 million, are subject to a full valuation allowance. The change in valuation allowance is $5.0 million and $3.9 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company will continue to review its deferred tax assets in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. The net deferred tax assets balance as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $63.3 million and $54.9 million, respectively.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe 2017 Tax Reform Act also creates a new requirement that Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by controlled foreign corporations (\u201cCFCs\u201d) that must be included currently in the gross income of a CFC\u2019s U.S. stockholder starting in the tax year that begins after 2017. GILTI does not have material impact on the Company's income tax provision.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (i) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the \u201cperiod cost method\u201d) or (ii) factoring such amounts into a company\u2019s measurement of its deferred taxes. The Company's selection of an accounting policy with respect to the GILTI tax rules is to treat GILTI tax as a current period expense under the period cost method.\nUnder the 2017 Tax Reform Act, starting on July 1, 2018, the Company is no longer subject to federal income tax on earnings remitted from our foreign subsidiaries. The Company previously asserted that all of its foreign undistributed earnings were indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the Company has determined that its foreign undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested except for Netherlands. The Company may repatriate foreign earnings from Netherlands which are previously taxed income as a result of the 2017 Tax Reform Act. The tax impact of such repatriation is estimated to be immaterial.\nAs a result of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, in December 2019, the Company realigned its international business operations and group structure. As a part of this restructuring, the Company moved certain intellectual property back to the United States. As a result of this restructuring, the Company estimated approximately $3.0 million and $1.9 million additional tax benefit from foreign derived intangible income in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted. The CARES Act provides temporary relief from certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Reform Act that imposed limitations on the utilization of certain losses, interest expense deductions, alternative minimum tax credits and made a technical correction to the 2017 Tax Reform Act related to the depreciable life of qualified improvement property. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company.\nThe following is a reconciliation for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, of the statutory rate to the Company\u2019s effective federal tax rate:\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $50.2 million. The state research and development tax credits will carryforward indefinitely to offset future state income taxes.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n________________________\n*excludes interest, penalties, federal benefit of state reserves\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized, was $27.1 million and $13.4 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had accrued $2.5 million and $2.1 million for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits, respectively.\nIn October 2019, the Taiwan tax authority completed its audit in Taiwan for fiscal year 2018 and proposed a transfer pricing adjustment on the Company which resulted in additional tax liability of $1.6 million. The Company accepted the proposed adjustment in October 2019 and paid the $1.6 million tax liability in February 2020. In February 2020, the Taiwan tax authority completed its audit in Taiwan for fiscal year 2019 and proposed a transfer pricing adjustment on the Company which resulted in additional tax liability of $1.0 million. The Company accepted the proposed adjustment and paid the $1.0 million tax liability in February 2020. The impact of these adjustments on the income statement was offset by the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the fiscal years audited in the periods in which the proposed adjustments were accepted.\nThe Company believes that it has adequately provided reserves for all uncertain tax positions; however, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than the Company\u2019s current position. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s provision on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or as the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.\nThe federal statute of limitations remains open in general for tax years ended June 30, 2018 through 2021. Various states statute of limitations remains open in general for tax years ended June 30, 2017 through 2021. Certain statutes of limitations in major foreign jurisdictions remain open in general for the tax years ended June 30, 2016 through 2021. It is reasonably possible that our gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $1.0 million, in the next 12\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nmonths, due to the lapse of the statute of limitations. These adjustments, if recognized, would positively impact our effective tax rate, and would be recognized as additional tax benefits.\nNote 16. Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation and Claims- On February 8, 2018, two putative class action complaints were filed against the Company, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and the Company's former Chief Financial Officer in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Hessefort v. Super Micro Computer, Inc., et al., No. 18-cv-00838 and United Union of Roofers v. Super Micro Computer, Inc., et al., No. 18-cv-00850). The complaints contain similar allegations, claiming that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act due to alleged misrepresentations and/or omissions in public statements regarding recognition of revenue. The court subsequently appointed New York Hotel Trades Council & Hotel Association of New York City, Inc. Pension Fund as lead plaintiff. The lead plaintiff then filed an amended complaint naming the Company's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations as an additional defendant. On June 21, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a further amended complaint naming the Company's former Senior Vice President of International Sales, Corporate Secretary, and Director as an additional defendant. On July 26, 2019, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 23, 2020, the Court granted the Company\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, with leave for lead plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 30 days. On April 22, 2020, lead plaintiff filed a further amended complaint. On June 5, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the further amended complaint, the hearing for which was calendared for September 23, 2020; however, the Court held a conference on September 15 to discuss how the Court could efficiently address the recent SEC settlement agreement. The parties stipulated to allow plaintiffs to further amend the complaint solely to add allegations relating to the SEC settlement. On October 14, 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint. On October 28, 2020, defendants filed a supplemental motion to dismiss. On March 29, 2021, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Exchange Act were dismissed with prejudice as against the Company\u2019s former head of Investor Relations, Perry Hayes. Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) claim, but not the Section 20 claim, was likewise dismissed as to Wally Liaw, a founder, former director, and former SVP of International Sales. The Court denied the motions to dismiss the Section 10(b) and Section 20 claims against the Company, Charles Liang, and Howard Hideshima, the Company\u2019s former CFO. Discovery has commenced, and the Court has calendared a hearing on class certification for January 20, 2022. The Company intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.\nOn October 27, 2020, certain current and former directors and officers of the Company were named as defendants in a putative derivative lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara (the \u201cCourt\u201d), captioned Barry v. Liang, et al., 20-CV-372190. The Company was also named as a nominal defendant. The complaint purports to allege claims for breaches of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment arising out of allegations that the Company\u2019s officers and directors caused the Company to issue false and misleading statements about recognition of revenue and the effectiveness of its internal controls, failed to adopt and implement effective internal controls, and failed to timely file various reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other equitable relief. Defendants filed demurrers, which were set for hearing on August 4, 2021, but which were continued to September 15, 2021. Following this continuance, on July 21, 2021, Plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended complaint in lieu of responding to the demurrer. The amended complaint added no new claims; primarily, the amendment added allegations describing the March 29, 2021 motion to dismiss decision in the Hessefort class action. Defendants demurred to the amended complaint on August 24, 2021, and the Court has calendared the hearing for November 24, 2021. The case is otherwise currently stayed. The Company intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.\nOn May 5, 2021, certain current and former directors and officers of the Company were named as defendants in a putative derivative lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Stein v. Liang, et al., Case No. 3:21-cv-03357-KAW (the \u201cStein Derivative Action\u201d). The Company was also named as a nominal defendant. The complaint purports to allege claims for breaches of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and contribution for violations of federal securities laws arising out of allegations that the Company\u2019s officers and directors caused the Company to issue false and misleading statements about recognition of revenue and the effectiveness of its internal controls, failed to adopt and implement effective internal controls, and failed to timely file various reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other equitable relief. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint on August 6, 2021, and the Court has calendared the hearing for November 4, 2021. The Company intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nSEC Matter- The Company cooperated with the SEC in its investigation of marketing expenses that contained certain irregularities discovered by Company management, which irregularities were disclosed on August 31, 2015, and the Company cooperated with the SEC in its further investigation of the matters underlying the Company\u2019s inability to timely file its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and concerning the publication of a false and widely discredited news article in October 2018 concerning the Company\u2019s products. On August 25, 2020, to fully resolve all matters under investigation, the Company consented to entry of an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (\u201cOrder\u201d), as announced by the SEC. The Company admitted the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction over the Company and the subject matter of the proceedings, but otherwise neither admitted nor denied the SEC\u2019s findings, as described in the Order. The Company agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The Company agreed and paid a civil money penalty of $17,500,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2020, which was recorded to general and administrative expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer concluded a settlement with the SEC on August 25, 2020, as announced by the SEC. The Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer paid the Company the sum of $2,122,000 as reimbursement of profits from certain stock sales during the relevant period, pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The settlement amount was paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and the Company recorded the payment as a credit to general and administrative expense.\nOther legal proceedings and indemnifications\nFrom time to time, the Company has been involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. The resolution of any such matters have not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity as of June 30, 2021 and any prior periods.\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its current and former directors and executive officers.\nUnder these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.\nPurchase Commitments - The Company has agreements to purchase inventory and non-inventory items primarily through the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2021, these remaining noncancelable commitments were $569.8 million, including $111.2 million for related parties.\nStandby Letter of Credit - In October 2019, Bank of America increased the value of a previously issued standby letter of credit to a beneficiary from $3.2 million to $6.4 million to facilitate ongoing operations of the Company. The standby letter of credit is cancellable upon written notice from the issuer. No amounts have been drawn under the standby letter of credit. In May 2021, the standby letter of credit was cancelled.\nLease Commitments - See Note 12, \"Leases,\" for a discussion of the Company's operating lease and financing lease commitments.\nNote 17. Retirement Plans\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) savings plan for eligible United States employees and their beneficiaries. Contributions by the Company are discretionary, and no contributions have been made by the Company for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nBeginning in March 2003, employees of Super Micro Computer, B.V. are required to deduct a portion of their gross wages based on a defined age-dependent premium and invest the amount in a defined contribution plan. The Company is required to match the amount that is deducted monthly from employees\u2019 wages. Similar to contributions into a 401(k) plan, the Company's obligation is limited to the contributions made to the contribution plan. Investment risk and investment rewards are\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nassumed by the employees and not by the Company. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s matching contribution was $0.7 million, $0.6 million, and $0.5 million, respectively.\nThe Company contributes to a defined contribution pension plan administered by the government of Taiwan that covers all eligible employees within Taiwan. Pension plan benefits are based primarily on participants\u2019 compensation and years of service credited as specified under the terms of Taiwan\u2019s plan. The funding policy is consistent with the local requirements of Taiwan. The Company's obligation is limited to the contributions made to the pension plan. The Company has no control over the investment strategy of the assets of the government administered pension plan. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s contribution was $2.5 million, $1.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nThe Company has a defined benefit pension plan under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law for certain employees of Super Micro Computer, Inc. Taiwan that provides benefits based on an employee\u2019s length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to the pension fund (the \u201cFund\u201d), which is administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) and deposited in the Committee\u2019s name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Fund. If the amount of the balance in the Fund is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for eligible employees in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March 31 of the next year. The Fund is operated and managed by the government\u2019s designated authorities. As such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Fund. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recorded a pension expense of $1.0 million. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s pension expense was immaterial.\nNote 18. Segment Reporting\nThe Company operates in one operating segment that develops and provides high performance server solutions based upon an innovative, modular and open-standard architecture.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) and Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d), we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), as of June 30, 2021. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2021.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are appropriately recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of management, acting under authority delegated to them by the Board, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nManagement, including our CEO and CFO, assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) (the \u201cCOSO Framework\u201d). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their opinion is stated in their report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRemediation of Prior Year Material Weakness\nWe have remediated the IT general controls that aggregated to a material weakness as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020. Since that time, with the oversight of our management and audit committee, we have implemented measures to remediate the material weakness. The following actions have been implemented and performed:\n\u2022Re-designed the logical access roles associated with our primary ERP application and re-provisioned those roles to enforce segregation of duties and align user access commensurate with their business process role and job responsibilities;\n\u2022Implemented a third-party application to facilitate improved processes and controls related to provisioning privileged access roles and the monitoring of those roles;\n\u2022For our boundary applications relevant to financial reporting, implemented new program change management control;\n\u2022Strengthened access and monitoring controls related to boundary systems;\n\u2022For our primary ERP application, strengthened provisioning of privileged access roles; and\n\u2022Monitored instances in which individuals were granted broad access.\nWe believe the foregoing efforts have effectively remediated the material weakness as these procedures\nhave been implemented for a sufficient period of time during the fiscal year and we have completed our testing of the design and operating effectiveness of these above procedures as of June 30, 2021. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may execute additional measures to enhance the overall design of our internal controls.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than the remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Super Micro Computer, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Super Micro Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, of the Company and our report dated August 27, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Jose, California\nAugust 27, 2021",

Directors chosen to fill newly created directorships hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders to which the term of the office of the class to which they have been elected expires.\nThe current composition of the Board of Directors is:\n__________________________\n(1)The term of Class I directors expires at the annual meeting of stockholders following fiscal year 2022.\n(2)The term of the Class II director expires at the annual meeting of stockholders following fiscal year 2023.\n(3)The term of Class III directors expires at the annual meeting of stockholders following fiscal year 2021.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nWe have adopted \u201cCorporate Governance Guidelines\u201d to help ensure that the Board of Directors is independent from management, appropriately performs its function as the overseer of management, and that the interests of the Board of Directors\nand management align with the interests of our stockholders. The \u201cCorporate Governance Guidelines\u201d are available at https://ir.supermicro.com/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a \u201cCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\u201d that is applicable to all directors, executive officers and employees and embodies our principles and practices relating to the ethical conduct of our business and our long-standing commitment to honesty, fair dealing and full compliance with all laws affecting our business. Our \u201cCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\u201d is available at https://ir.supermicro.com/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx. Any substantive amendment or waiver of the Code relating to executive officers or directors will be made only after approval by our Board of Directors and will be promptly disclosed on our website within four business days.\nDirector Independence\nThe listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market generally require that a majority of the members of a listed company's board of directors be independent. In addition, the listing rules generally require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit committee, compensation committee, and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent. Audit Committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") and the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition, compensation committee members must satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act and the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nThe Board affirmatively determines the independence of each director and nominee for election as a director in accordance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nBased on these standards, our Board of Directors has determined that five of its current seven members, Daniel W. Fairfax, Saria Tseng, Sherman Tuan Shiu Leung (Fred) Chan and Tally Liu, are \"independent directors\" under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing requirements and rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nExecutive Sessions\nNon-management directors meet in executive session without management present each time the Board holds its regularly scheduled meetings.\nCommunications with the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors welcomes the submission of any comments or concerns from stockholders or other interested parties.

In accordance with applicable listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market, each of these committees is comprised solely of non-employee, independent directors.

However, information for Mr. Bauer is still presented in this Executive Compensation section as Mr. Bauer served as Chief Financial Officer during a portion of fiscal year 2021.\n(2)Mr. Hsu served as Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer until March 2021. In March 2021, Mr. Hsu transitioned to the role of Senior Chief Executive, Strategic Business.\nOverview of Compensation\n_____________________________\n(1) The chart presents the percentage compensation by compensation component received by the five presented non-CEO named executive officers together (aggregate compensation) as a group, as well as the split between cash and equity compensation for all such persons received in aggregate as a group.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives-Our Move Toward Performance-Based Compensation Arrangements\nOur executive compensation philosophy is to link compensation to corporate performance, particularly the compensation of Mr. Liang, our CEO. Starting in fiscal year 2018 (beginning July 1, 2017), we have moved toward an explicit linking of Mr. Liang\u2019s compensation to performance goals. This movement began in August 2017, when approximately half of Mr. Liang\u2019s equity awards for fiscal year 2018 were in the form of performance-based restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d). This\ntrend was interrupted during the time when we were not current in filing our periodic reports with the SEC (September 2017 to January 2020). See our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 on file with the SEC for a description of the circumstances that led to us not being able to file our periodic reports during that time.\nAfter we returned to being current in our SEC filings in December 2019, we continued to link more of Mr. Liang\u2019s compensation to corporate performance, through granting him a special cash award opportunity in March 2020 tied to stock price and other metrics, and a short-term incentive award opportunity in May 2020 tied to corporate performance metrics for fiscal year 2020. This movement culminated in March 2021, when we changed Mr. Liang\u2019s compensation to be almost completely performance-based. As discussed in more detail below, in March 2021, we converted nearly 100% of Mr. Liang\u2019s compensation to performance-based compensation through the issuance of options (the \u201c2021 CEO Performance Award\u201d) to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $45.00 per share, which was 32% higher than the market price of our common stock on the date of the award ($34.08). The option is comprised of five tranches, which vest only if the market price of our common stock reaches various prices (ranging from $45.00 to $120.00 per share) and we achieve certain specified revenue goals, all as described in greater detail below. In connection with the 2021 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Liang\u2019s base salary was reduced to $1.00 per year (or, if required by law, the statutory minimum wage applicable in San Jose, California) and Mr. Liang agreed that he would not be eligible for any increase in base salary, or any other cash compensation, until June 30, 2026.\nIn summary, as of the end of fiscal year 2021, almost all of Mr. Liang\u2019s compensation for the next five years is based upon us achieving the revenue goals described below and the market price of our common stock meeting the price targets described below. To fully achieve those goals and targets, our revenue must increase from $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2021 to $8 billion, and the market price of our common stock must reach $120, an increase of 252% from the market price on the day the stock options were awarded. See below for more details about the 2021 CEO Performance Award.\nThrough fiscal year 2021, we have utilized explicit linking of compensation to performance metrics less with our other NEOs than we have with Mr. Liang. The extent of such linking is described in greater detail below. During fiscal year 2022, the Compensation Committee intends to continue exploring (with Mr. Liang) the appropriate balance between performance-based equity awards like PRSUs and our traditional use of stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) with time-based vesting for future long-term equity programs for other named executive officers. While PRSUs provide the recipient the opportunity to earn a defined number of shares of our common stock if we and/or the recipient achieve pre-set performance goals over time and have become increasingly common in compensation arrangements in the technology industry generally, we believe that our traditional approach to equity awards has served us well, both historically and in fiscal year 2021.\nProcess Overview\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board discharges the Board\u2019s responsibilities relating to compensation of all of our executive officers. During fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee was comprised of three non-employee directors through May 28, 2021 and two non-employee directors for the remainder of the fiscal year through June 30, 2021 following the expiration of the term of office of Mr. Hwei-Ming (Fred) Chan as a director. All of the non-employee directors who served on the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2021 were independent pursuant to the applicable listing rules of NASDAQ and Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.\nThe agenda for meetings is determined by the Chair of the Compensation Committee with the assistance of our Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. Committee meetings are regularly attended by our Chief Financial Officer and our General Counsel. However, neither our Chief Financial Officer nor our General Counsel attends the portion of meetings during which his own performance or compensation is being discussed. Our Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel support the Compensation Committee in its work by providing information relating to our financial plans and certain personnel-related data. In addition, the Compensation Committee has the authority under its charter to hire, terminate and approve fees for advisors, consultants and agents as it deems necessary to assist in the fulfillment of its responsibilities. As part of making an overall assessment of each named executive officer\u2019s role and performance, and structuring our compensation programs for fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer, as well as publicly available peer group compensation data and data compiled by our independent compensation consultant.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee considered various sources of information and comparative data when structuring the compensation awards issued and determining executive compensation levels, including information and compensation data assembled for the Compensation Committee by Radford, an Aon Hewitt company (\"Radford\"), from a sample of public companies selected by us.\nFor the 2021 CEO Performance Award, the Compensation Committee considered similar awards issued by technology companies consisting of Tesla, Axon Enterprise, RH Technologies, Dish Networks, Oracle, and Sorento Therapeutics. The Compensation Committee engaged Radford in designing, modeling, drafting and reviewing the 2021 CEO Performance Award.\nIn addition, for other fiscal year 2021 compensation decisions, the sample consisted of the following companies(1):\n__________________________\n(1)The same sample companies were used for fiscal year 2019, 2020 and 2021. In selecting the companies for inclusion in the sample, we considered whether the company may compete against us for executive talent.\n(2)Although Cray Inc. was acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company in 2019, it remained included in the information regarding the sample public companies that was used for fiscal year 2021 purposes.\nOther than with respect to the 2021 CEO Performance Award for which the independent consultant prepared a report in March 2021 at the request of the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee utilized for fiscal year 2021 the independent consultant report developed for fiscal year 2019 as it believed the report continued to be relevant. Recognizing that over-reliance on external comparisons can be of concern, the Compensation Committee used external comparisons as only one point of reference and is mindful of the value and limitations of comparative data.\nKey Fiscal Year 2021 Executive Compensation Decisions and Actions\nDuring fiscal years 2019 and 2020, the Compensation Committee generally refrained from compensation adjustments for named executive officers until after such time as we became current in our filings with the SEC (which occurred in December 2019) and our stock was re-listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (which occurred in January 2020), except in connection with out of the ordinary circumstances, such as a transition in executive officers. At the beginning of fiscal year 2021 (which began July 1, 2020), the Compensation Committee decided that, in light of (1) the recent increase during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 in the base salaries of named executive officers, (2) the fiscal year 2020 incentive cash program tied to specific performance goals adopted during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 in which each of our named executive officers participated, (3) approval during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 of special performance-based cash incentive award opportunities linked to stock price to certain long-term employees (which included some of the named executive officers), and (4) special cash bonus payments made to certain of our employees (which included some of the named executive officers), all of which were discussed in the CD&A for fiscal year 2020 included in our most recent proxy statement (the \u201cPrior Year CD&A\u201d), it would generally not implement increases in base salaries or annual cash incentive opportunities for named executive officers, except in connection with out of the ordinary circumstances, such as a transition in executive officers.\nIn order to further incentivize Mr. Liang\u2019s continued long-term performance as Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee designed the 2021 CEO Performance Award to be a challenging long-term incentive for future performance. In connection with the issuance of such award in March 2021, the Compensation Committee noted in particular that the performance thresholds adopted were challenging and could take years to achieve. In addition, the Compensation Committee sought to help ensure that the 2021 CEO Performance Award would further align Mr. Liang\u2019s interests with those of the Company\u2019s stockholders over the long-term. In connection with the grant of the 2021 CEO Performance Award, it was also determined that Mr. Liang would receive a de minimis salary of $1 per annum (or such other non-waivable minimum wage requirement, if deemed advisable) and no cash bonuses through June 30, 2026. Mr. Liang must also remain as the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (or such other position with the Company as Mr. Liang and the Board may agree) at the time each goal set forth in the 2021 CEO Performance Award is met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. This helps ensure Mr. Liang\u2019s active leadership of the Company over the long-term.\nAs a result of our becoming current in our filings with the SEC in December 2019 and stockholder approval of the 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan at the annual meeting of stockholders held on June 5, 2020, we were in position to also re-commence the grant of equity incentives to our employees during fiscal year 2021, including our named executive officers. In addition to the special grant to Mr. Liang of the 2021 CEO Performance Award, during fiscal year 2021, we made grants under the 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan of equity incentives to each of Mr. Weigand, Mr. Clegg and Mr. Kao, which grants were consistent with our historical practice prior to the time we had ceased being current in our periodic filings with the SEC in 2017, all as discussed further below.\nAdditional Information on the Compensation Committee's Compensation Consultant\nFor fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee utilized information from Radford in making certain named executive officer compensation decisions. Previously, in fiscal year 2019, Radford had advised the Compensation Committee regarding executive officer compensation decisions and our management had commissioned Radford to provide additional services to management for similar compensation studies to evaluate components of total compensation for our employees generally. In making the adjustments to base salaries for our named executive officers in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Compensation Committee relied on information that Radford had provided in both fiscal year 2020 and in fiscal year 2019. In addition, in connection with evaluating the 2021 CEO Performance Award in fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee considered information Radford had provided in March 2021 related to peer group chief executive officer compensation and pay-for-performance analyses, as described above.\nIn fiscal year 2019, before receiving Radford\u2019s information and assistance, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Radford in the light of all relevant factors, including the additional services and other factors required by the SEC, that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest with respect to Radford. Based on these reviews and assessments, the Compensation Committee did not identify any conflicts of interest raised by the work performed by Radford. In each of fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the Compensation Committee updated its assessment of Radford\u2019s independence and did not identify any conflicts of interest raised by additional work performed by Radford in such fiscal years.\nThe Role of the Most Recent Stockholder Say-on-Pay Vote\nThe Compensation Committee, with the entire Board, and our management value the opinions of our stockholders. As discussed in the Prior Year CD&A, feedback received from stockholders has included a desire that a more significant portion of executive compensation (including future equity awards made following the adoption of the 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan) be tied to performance based upon the achievement of pre-established goals. For fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee took such prior feedback into consideration when it developed, designed, and granted the 2021 CEO Performance Award. In addition, prior to granting such award in March 2021, the Compensation Committee (through management) solicited the views of several of our largest stockholders regarding the grants of large, long-term performance based equity incentives, including compensation philosophy embodied by these types of awards, potential size, appropriate performance metrics, the time periods within which such metrics should be achieved, and other terms.\nOur last annual meeting of stockholders was held on May 28, 2021 (the \"Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Meeting\"), and we provided our stockholders the annual opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement for such meeting. At the meeting, stockholders representing approximately 78% of the stock present and entitled to vote on this \u201csay-on-pay\u201d proposal approved the compensation of our named executive officers. Although the Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Meeting was held during the latter part of fiscal year 2021 when significant decisions affecting compensation matters for fiscal year 2021 for the named executives had already been made by the Compensation Committee and the say-on-pay vote was non-binding, the Compensation Committee expects to continue to consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers.\nRole of Executive Officers in the Compensation Process\nEach year, management provides recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding compensation program design and evaluations of executive and Company performance. In particular, in fiscal year 2021, our Chief Executive Officer provided the Compensation Committee with his views on the merits of large, long-term performance based equity incentives while minimizing other typical compensation components, such as base salary and short-term cash and equity incentives. Mr. Liang was very willing to change his compensation arrangements so that almost all of his compensation for the next five years will depend on whether we achieve the difficult performance metrics embedded in the 2021 CEO Performance Award. Mr. Liang has expressed his view that this change in his compensation arrangements is evidence of his commitment to our Company and his confidence in our future.\nFollowing stockholder approval of the 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan in June 2020 that had (among other things) refreshed the pool of equity awards available for grant, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer provided the Compensation Committee with their views on non-CEO named executive officer equity grants based on their view of investor expectations and our operating plans and financial goals. At the end of fiscal year 2021, our Chief Executive Officer provided the Compensation Committee with his views of the nature and extent of our performance against expectations. Finally, our Chief Executive Officer also provided the Compensation Committee with regular performance evaluations of the other named executive officers, including his views as to their impact on strategic initiatives and organizational goals, as well as their functional expertise and leadership. While the Compensation Committee carefully considers all recommendations made by members of management, ultimate authority for all compensation decisions regarding our named executive officers rests with the Compensation Committee and the Board.\n2021 CEO Performance Award Granted in March 2021\nTerms of the 2021 CEO Performance Award\nOn March 2, 2021, the Compensation Committed granted to our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Liang, a long-term performance-based option award to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock which may vest in five equal tranches. Each of the five tranches vests if a specified revenue goal (each, a \u201cRevenue Goal\u201d) and a specified stock price goal (each, a \u201cStock Price Goal\u201d) is achieved. Revenue Goals must be achieved by June 30, 2026 (the \u201cRevenue Performance Period\u201d) and Stock Price Goals must be achieved by September 30, 2026 (the \u201cStock Price Performance Period\u201d). The 2021 CEO Performance Award was granted with an exercise price equal to $45.00 (the \u201cExercise Price\u201d), representing a premium of approximately 32% to the closing stock price of $34.08 reported on NASDAQ on March 2, 2021. The 2021 CEO Performance Award will generally expire on March 2, 2031 and includes, among other terms and conditions, a restriction on the sale of any shares issued upon exercise of the 2021 CEO Performance Award until March 2, 2024, the third anniversary of the date of grant.\nThe Compensation Committee designed the 2021 CEO Performance Award to be a challenging long-term incentive for future performance, and the Compensation Committee noted in particular that the performance thresholds could take many years to achieve, if they can be achieved at all. In addition, the Compensation Committee intended that the 2021 CEO Performance Award would further align Mr. Liang\u2019s interests with those of the Company\u2019s stockholders over the long term. In connection with the grant of the 2021 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Liang will receive a de minimis salary of $1 per annum (or such other non-waivable minimum wage requirement, if deemed advisable) and no cash bonuses through June 30, 2026. Mr. Liang must also remain as the Company\u2019s CEO (or such other position with the Company as Mr. Liang and the Board may agree) at the time each goal is met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. This helps ensure Mr. Liang\u2019s active leadership of the Company over the long term.\nThe following table sets forth the Revenue Goals which must be achieved by the end of the Revenue Performance Period of June 30, 2026:\n__________________________\n(1)Revenue means the Company\u2019s total revenues, as reported by the Company in its financial statements on Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC (but without giving effect to any rounding used in reporting the amounts in Form 10-Q and Form 10-K), for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Company.\n(2)Revenue reported in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was $3,339.3 million. Revenue reported in this report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was $3,557.4 million.\nThe following table sets forth the Stock Price Goals which must be achieved by September 30, 2026:\n__________________________\n(1)Sustained stock price performance is required for each Stock Price Goal to be met, other than in connection with a change in control. For each Stock Price Goal to be met, the sixty trading day average stock price must equal or exceed the Stock Price Goal.\n(2)Utilizes closing stock price on March 2, 2021 of $34.08 per share. The June 30, 2021 closing stock price was $35.18 per share.\nEach of the five tranches vests only when both the applicable Revenue Goal and Stock Price Goal for such tranche are certified by the Compensation Committee as having been met.\nA Revenue Goal and a Stock Price Goal that are matched together can be achieved at different points in time and vesting will occur at the later of the achievement certification dates for such Revenue Goal and Stock Price Goal. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms described in the 2021 CEO Performance Award, once a goal is achieved, it is forever deemed achieved for determining the vesting of a tranche.\nThere is no automatic acceleration of vesting of the 2021 CEO Performance Award upon a future \u201cchange in control\u201d, but any tranches that are unvested as of the date of the change in control will vest upon the change in control if the Stock Price Goal related to that tranche is achieved (the Revenue Goals will be disregarded). For purposes of determining whether any Stock Price Goal has been achieved, the stock price shall equal the greater of (1) the most recent closing price per share immediately prior to the effective time of such change in control, or (2) the per share common stock price (plus the per share of common stock value of any other consideration) received by our stockholders in the change in control. To the extent any tranche of the 2021 CEO Performance Award has not vested prior to the change in control, and does not vest in connection with the change of control based on attainment of the relevant Stock Price Goal, as described above, such tranche under the 2021 CEO Performance Award will terminate as of the effective date of the change in control.\nReasons for the 2021 CEO Performance Award\nThe Compensation Committee\u2019s primary objective in designing the 2021 CEO Performance Award was to help the Company continue to grow and achieve its mission, which would facilitate the creation of significant stockholder value.\nMr. Liang has been critical to fulfilling the Company\u2019s mission to be the leading innovator in high-performance, high-efficiency server and storage technology while being committed to protect the environment through, and provide customers with, the most energy-efficient, environmentally-friendly solutions available on the market. Mr. Liang co-founded the Company, has been our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman since our inception, leads the overall management of the Company, and sets our strategic direction. His experience in running our business, and his continued personal involvement in key relationships with suppliers, customers and strategic partners and directing product innovations, will be extremely valuable to the Company as the Company looks to re-accelerate its growth and meet its bold vision to achieve the Revenue Goals and Stock Price Goals embedded in the 2021 CEO Performance Award.\nMr. Liang remains the Company's largest stockholder, and the Compensation Committee believes the 2021 CEO Performance Award helps ensure his commitment and focus on delivering on a long-term vision that can increase stockholder value.\nFiscal Year 2021 Named Executive Officer Compensation Components, Other than the 2021 CEO Performance Award\nFor fiscal year 2021, the principal components of compensation for our named executive officers (including for the Chief Executive Officer during fiscal year 2021 prior to the grant of the 2021 CEO Performance Award in March 2021) were some or all of the following:\n\u2022Base salary;\n\u2022Short-term bonuses, some of which are discretionary and some of which are guaranteed; and\n\u2022Equity-based incentive compensation consisting of grants of stock options and/or RSUs.\nBase Salary. We pay base salaries to our named executive officers to provide them with a base level of fixed income for services rendered to us. Base salary rates for our named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer are determined annually by the Compensation Committee based upon recommendations by our Chief Executive Officer, typically taking into account factors such as salary norms in comparable companies and publicly available data regarding compensation increases in our industry, subjective assessments of the nature of the officers' positions and an annual review of the contribution and experience of each named executive officer. For the Chief Executive Officer, prior to the grant of the 2021 CEO Performance Award in March 2021, the Compensation Committee had considered substantially the same type of information, as well as our overall size in terms of annual revenue, scale and number of employees and the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s overall stock ownership. In connection with the grant of the 2021 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Liang will receive a de minimis salary of $1 per annum (or such other non-waivable minimum wage requirement, if deemed advisable) and no cash bonuses through June 30, 2026.\nOther than as discussed in the paragraphs above and below, the Compensation Committee held base salaries at the same annual rates as were in effect at the end of fiscal year 2020. As had been discussed in the Prior Year CD&A, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Compensation Committee had approved increases in base salary rates for the named executive officers, which ranged from approximately 8% to 43%, after we had again become current in filing our periodic reports with the SEC and our common stock was relisted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nIn addition, following the assumption of the role of Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer in February 2021 by Mr. Weigand, the Compensation Committee approved an adjustment to his base salary to $380,000 per annum, which was substantially identical to the annual base salary of his predecessor. Mr. Hsu\u2019s base salary was also adjusted following a transition in his role (and a decrease in his responsibilities) as discussed in the table below.\n____________________\n(1)The base salary amounts actually paid to each named executive officer for fiscal year 2020 and 2021 are disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table. The fiscal year 2020 salary amounts disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table for each named executive officer are less than the amounts disclosed in the table above because each named executive officer was receiving his fiscal year 2019 base salary rate for a portion of fiscal year 2020. In addition:\n\u2022For Mr. Liang, the fiscal year 2021 salary amount disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table is higher than the amount disclosed in the table above because Mr. Liang commenced receiving his $1 de minimis base salary following the grant of the 2021 CEO Performance Award in March 2021;\n\u2022For Mr. Weigand, the fiscal year 2021 salary amount disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table is lower than the amount disclosed in the table above because Mr. Weigand only commenced receiving the amount set forth in the table following his appointment in February 2021 as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer;\n\u2022For Mr. Hsu, the fiscal year 2021 salary amount disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table is higher than the amount disclosed in the table above because for most of fiscal year 2021 Mr. Hsu served in the role of Chief Operating Officer at his fiscal year 2020 base salary rate. In March 2021, Mr. Hsu transitioned to the role of Senior Chief Executive, Strategic Business, a part-time position, from his prior role as Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and ceased being an executive officer, and his base salary rate was adjusted to the fiscal year 2021 base salary rate in the table above. Such amount was determined primarily through discussions with the Chief Executive Officer; and\n\u2022For Mr. Bauer, the fiscal year 2021 salary amount disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table is lower than the amount disclosed in the table above because Mr. Bauer resigned as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer in January 2021.\nShort-Term Incentive Cash Compensation. In fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee did not utilize a uniform short-term incentive cash compensation program for the named executive officers. As discussed in the Prior Year CD&A, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 the Compensation Committee had implemented a short-term incentive cash compensation program for fiscal year 2020 with performance goals as part of its review of executive compensation following the re-listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (which had occurred in January 2020) in order to support our overall business objectives by aligning short-term Company performance with the interests of investors and focusing attention on key measures of success. Following the completion of such short-term incentive cash program, the Compensation Committee did not believe it was necessary to renew a similar program for fiscal year 2021.\nOther Short-Term Bonuses. During fiscal year 2021, we instead utilized individualized short-term cash bonus arrangements with various officers of the Company, including all of our named executive officers. In some cases these arrangements pre-date the time that these individuals became executive officers, in other cases the arrangements were negotiated at the time the individual was hired or was designated as an executive officer, and in still other cases the arrangements were new short-term bonus opportunities implemented for fiscal year 2021. These arrangements provide for fixed bonus payments, variable bonus payments, or a hybrid program. We award these short-term bonuses to the named executive officers for their continued achievements and contributions to the Company, as further described below. The table below summarizes the fiscal year 2021 arrangements for the named executive officers.\nEquity-Based Incentive Compensation. Stock options and other equity-based awards are also an important component of the total compensation of our named executive officers. We believe that equity-based awards also align the interests of each named executive officer with those of our stockholders. They also provide named executive officers a significant, long-term interest in our success and help retain key named executive officers in a competitive market for executive talent. The 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan authorized the Compensation Committee to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to eligible named executive officers. The number of shares owned by, or subject to equity-based awards held by, each\nnamed executive officer is periodically reviewed and additional awards are considered based upon a generalized assessment of past performance, expected future performance and the relative holdings of other executive officers. The Compensation Committee has historically granted equity awards to employees on a two-year cycle.\nDue to the fact that we failed to file our 2017 Form 10-K by its due date, the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-8 covering equity awards under our prior 2016 Equity Incentive Plan was suspended. It remained suspended until December 20, 2019, the date on which we had completed filing all of our delinquent quarterly and annual reports with the SEC. The effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-8 for the prior 2016 Equity Incentive Plan was then revived. The Compensation Committee did not make equity awards to our named executive officers during the period of time when our registration statement on Form S-8 for the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan was not effective, except to persons who became named executive officers during this period. With the adoption of the 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, and the effectiveness of a Form S-8 registration statement for that plan and awards granted under it on June 16, 2020, our Compensation Committee has granted, and expects that it will continue to grant, additional equity awards to our named executive officers that will reflect the lack of equity awards for the period of time during which the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-8 for our prior 2016 Equity Incentive Plan was suspended. We expect to make all future equity awards out of the 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan.\nFor fiscal year 2021, which commenced July 1, 2020, the Compensation Committee determined to provide the awards of performance-based stock options, service-based stock options and RSUs to named executive officers as outlined in the table below.\n__________________________\n(1)See \u201c2021 CEO Performance Award Granted in March 2021\u201d above for additional information.\n(2)Mr. Weigand assumed the role of Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer following the resignation of Mr. Bauer in January 2021.\n(3)Mr. Hsu served as Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer until March 2021. In March 2021, Mr. Hsu transitioned to the role of Senior Chief Executive, Strategic Business. Although Mr. Hsu did not receive any new grants of equity awards during fiscal year 2021, the original vesting schedules for his awards outstanding as of February 28, 2021 were continued despite his reduction in responsibilities effective March 1, 2021, and his awards were deemed modified for accounting purposes. For more information about modification fair value for Mr. Hsu\u2019s awards relating to his transition, please see the \u201cFiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table\u201d and \u201cFiscal Year 2021 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table\u201d below.\nStock Options. In general, the Compensation Committee uses stock options to directly align the compensation interests of participating named executive officers with the investment interests of our stockholders. See \u201c2021 CEO Performance Award Granted in March 2021\u201d for additional information regarding the grant of the long-term performance-based option award to Mr. Liang. The stock options described above for each of Messrs. Weigand and Clegg were granted on August 4, 2020 with a 10-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date ($30.33 per share). Subject to the continued service of such named executive officers, these stock options vest and become exercisable at the rate of 25% of the shares on May 1, 2021, and 1/16th at the end of each successive calendar quarter thereafter. The Compensation Committee had approved utilizing May 1, 2021 as the first vesting date because (if not for the delay in the Company\u2019s ability to issue equity incentive awards because it did not have an effective registration statement on Form S-8 covering equity awards under its equity incentive plans) such awards otherwise would have been made for these named executive officers on or prior to May 1, 2020 as part of their two-year award cycle. The stock options described above for Mr. Kao were granted on October 27, 2020 with a 10-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date ($23.74 per share). Subject to the continued service of such named executive officer, the grant is generally exercisable at the rate of 25% of the options granted on October 27, 2021, and then 1/16th at the end of each successive calendar quarter thereafter. The particular size of the stock option grants to each of these named executive officers was determined based upon the recommendation of Mr. Liang which was reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee.\nRSUs. In general, RSUs represent the right to receive a defined number of shares of our common stock subject to the continued employment through the vesting date. The RSUs described above for each of Messrs. Weigand and Clegg were granted on August 4, 2020. Subject to the continued service of such named executive officers, these RSUs vest at the rate of 25% of the total number of units on May 10, 2021, and 1/16th at the end of each successive calendar quarter thereafter. The Compensation Committee had approved utilizing May 10, 2021 as the first vesting date because (if not for the delay in the Company\u2019s ability to issue equity incentive awards because it did not have an effective registration statement on Form S-8 covering equity awards under its equity incentive plans) such awards otherwise would have been made for these named executive officers on or prior to May 10, 2020 as part of their two-year award cycle. The RSUs described above for Mr. Kao were granted on October 27, 2020. Subject to the continued service of such named executive officer, these RSUs vest at the rate of 25% of the total number of units on November 10, 2021, and 1/16th at the end of each successive calendar quarter thereafter. The particular size of the RSU grants to each of these named executive officers was determined based upon the recommendation of Mr. Liang which was reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee.\nPRSUs. PRSUs represent the right to receive a defined number of shares of our common stock subject to the achievement of pre-established goals. Mr. Hsu received a grant of 30,000 in target PRSUs on March 27, 2020. In general, a total of 30,000 units were to vest based on service conditions only, with the first tranche of 15,000 vesting in May 2021 and 15,000 vesting in November 2021. Additional units could have been earned for each tranche if the Company\u2019s revenue increased year-over-year (fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 for the first tranche and fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 for the second tranche).\nWith respect to the first tranche, the Company\u2019s revenue for fiscal year 2020 ($3,339 million) did not exceed revenue for fiscal 2019 ($3,500 million), so no additional units were earned for the first tranche. With respect to the second tranche, if the Company\u2019s revenue for fiscal year 2021 exceeded its revenue for fiscal year 2020, then a number of additional units would have been earned for the second tranche. The number of additional units was to be determined by multiplying the percentage growth in revenue by three, which amount would have then been a multiplier of the base number of 15,000 units. Based upon the Company\u2019s revenue for fiscal year 2021 ($3,557 million) increased from revenue for fiscal year 2020, management has calculated that for the second tranche, approximately 2,939 additional units were earned, such that a total of 17,939 units will vest in November 2021. Such amount remains subject to final certification by the Compensation Committee.\nUpdate on Special Performance-Based Cash Incentive Award Granted in March 2020\nAs discussed in the Prior Year CD&A, in March 2020, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved special performance-based cash incentive award opportunities to certain long-term employees, including Mr. Liang, our Chief Executive Officer. This incentive for Mr. Liang was specifically linked to Company stock price performance. Mr. Liang\u2019s award, for a cash incentive opportunity of up to $8,076,701 (the \u201cMaximum Value\u201d), was subject to the following conditions:\n\u202250% of the Maximum Value will be paid to Mr. Liang only if the average closing price for the Company\u2019s common stock equals or exceeds $31.61 (representing a 15% premium over the average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the Board\u2019s decision) for any period of 20 consecutive trading days prior to September 30, 2021 (the \u201cFirst Price Target\u201d), provided that Mr. Liang remains employed with the Company through the date that such common stock price goal is achieved; provided further that this payment shall be subject to reduction (including possibly a reduction to zero) at the sole discretion of the Board to the extent the Company has not made, in the Board\u2019s determination, adequate progress in remediating its internal weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u202250% of the Maximum Value will be paid to Mr. Liang only if the average closing price for the Company\u2019s common stock equals or exceeds $32.99 (representing a 20% premium over the average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the Board\u2019s decision) (the \u201cSecond Price Target\u201d) for any period of 20 consecutive trading days prior to June 30, 2022, provided that Mr. Liang remains employed with the Company through the date that such common stock price goal is achieved.\nThe relevant stock price goals under Mr. Liang\u2019s award were not met during fiscal year 2020, and no portion of these amounts were paid to Mr. Liang during fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, the First Price Target was achieved based upon stock price performance from December 22, 2020 through January 21, 2021. As of August 27, 2021, the Board has not yet determined whether to exercise any negative discretion with respect to the first 50% of the Maximum Value earned by Mr. Liang (as described in the first bullet point above), and no portion of the first 50% of the Maximum Value has yet been paid to Mr. Liang through such date. The Board is expected to make a final determination whether to exercise any negative discretion by October 31, 2021. However, due to the fact that we currently expect that the Board will determine that the Company has made adequate progress in remediating the Company\u2019s material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, we have chosen to disclose the first 50% of the Maximum Value as having been earned by Mr. Liang for fiscal year 2021, and are\ndisclosing it as an earned amount in the Summary Compensation Table below, all in advance of formal Board determination. Also during fiscal year 2021, the Second Price Target was achieved based upon stock price performance from February 8, 2021 through March 8, 2021. Payment of the 50% of the Maximum Value relating to the Second Price Target was made to Mr. Liang during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. As a result of these activities and achievements, we currently consider 100% of the Maximum Value to have been earned by Mr. Liang for fiscal year 2021.\nFormer CFO Consulting Arrangement\nPrior to ceasing employment with the Company as Chief Financial Officer, in February 2021 Mr. Bauer entered into a consulting arrangement with the Company related to reinforcing a smooth transition of his prior duties, and providing general consultation and advice services. The term of the arrangement is for one year with a monthly fee of $13,334 for services. As a result of the consulting service provided for in the consulting arrangement, Mr. Bauer's outstanding equity awards generally will continue to vest during the consulting period in accordance with their terms and the period Mr. Bauer was permitted to exercise his awards was extended until May 25, 2022. Assuming a stock price equal to $32.50 (our closing stock price on February 25, 2021, Mr. Bauer\u2019s last day of employment), the intrinsic value of the unvested awards subject to such continued vesting was approximately $40,500 in stock options and $0 in RSUs.\nOn April 27, 2021, Mr. Bauer was also granted 10,000 stock options to compensate his consulting efforts in a smooth transition of his prior duties, and his provision of general consultation and advice services. Such stock options have a 10-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date ($38.50 per share). Subject to the continued provision of consulting services, these stock options vest and become exercisable at the rate of 100% of the shares on February 25, 2022. The number of shares subject to these stock options was determined primarily through discussions with the Chief Executive Officer.\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nOther than as discussed below under \u201cStock Retention Policy,\u201d we currently do not require our directors or executive officers to own a particular amount of our common stock. The Compensation Committee is satisfied that stock and option holdings among our directors and named executive officers have historically been sufficient to provide motivation and to align this group\u2019s interests with those of our stockholders. Our insider trading policy prohibits any of our directors, executive officers, employees or contractors from engaging in any transactions in publicly-traded options, such as puts and calls, and other derivative securities, including any hedging or similar transaction, with respect to our common stock.\nStock Retention Policy\nWe have adopted a stock retention policy which requires that our Chief Executive Officer hold a significant portion of the shares of our common stock acquired under our equity incentive plans for at least 36 months. Generally, under the policy, the Chief Executive Officer must retain at least 50% of all \u201cnet\u201d shares received (\u201cnet\u201d shares means those shares remaining after the sale or withholding of shares in payment of the exercise price, if applicable, and withholding taxes) for at least 36 months following the date on which an equity award is vested, settled or exercised, as applicable. In addition, in connection with the 2021 CEO Performance Award granted to our Chief Executive Officer in March 2021, the Board required a restriction on the sale of any shares issued upon the exercise of the options associated with such award until March 2, 2024, the third anniversary of the grant date. See \u201c2021 CEO Performance Award Granted in March 2021.\u201d\nRecoupment Policy\nWe established a recoupment policy that is applicable to our named executive officers (the \u201cRecoupment Policy\u201d). Under the Recoupment Policy, if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with the financial reporting requirements under United States securities laws, the Compensation Committee shall be entitled to recover from any current or former executive officer any excess incentive-based compensation received by such person during the three-year period prior to the date on which we are required to prepare the restatement. This Recoupment Policy applies to both equity-based and cash-based incentive compensation awards. The \u201cexcess incentive-based compensation\u201d is the difference between the actual amount that was paid, and the amount that would have been paid under the restated financial results.\nOther Benefits\nHealth and Welfare Benefits. Our named executive officers receive the same health and welfare benefits as are offered to our other employees, including medical, dental, vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability insurance coverage, flexible spending account participation and holiday pay. The same contribution amounts, percentages and plan design provisions are applicable to all employees. We offer these health and welfare benefits generally to help provide a competitive compensation package to employees to assist with the attraction, hiring and retention of employees.\nRetirement Program. Our named executive officers may participate in the same tax-qualified, employee-funded 401(k) plan that is offered to all our other employees. We do not maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan, nor do we offer any defined benefit retirement plans or other defined contribution plans to our named executive officers. We offer these retirement program benefits generally to help provide a competitive compensation package to employees to assist with the attraction, hiring and retention of employees.\nPerquisites. We do not provide perquisites or personal benefits to any of our named executive officers.\nEmployment Arrangements, Severance and Change of Control Benefits. We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our named executive officers (we have entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Bauer, which is further described above under \u201c- Former CFO Consulting Arrangement\u201d). Each of Messrs. Clegg, Hsu, Kao and Weigand currently has a signed offer letter which provides for at-will employment. Each such offer letter provides for an initial base salary rate, an initial stock option grant and rights to participate in our employee benefit plans as described above. Prior to his departure in February 2021, Mr. Bauer had a substantially similar offer letter. We do not have any written employment arrangements with Mr. Liang. Other than as described in the following sentence, we do not have any arrangements with any of our named executive officers that provide for any severance or other benefits in the event of termination or change of control of our Company. See also \u201c- Fiscal Year 2021 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control.\u201d The 2021 CEO Performance Award has certain provisions related to the treatment of such award in the event of a change of control of our Company. See \u201c2021 CEO Performance Award Granted in March 2021.\u201d\nTax and Accounting Considerations. In our review and establishment of named executive officer compensation programs and payments, we consider, but do not place substantial emphasis on, the anticipated accounting and tax treatment of our compensation programs to us and our named executive officers. Among other factors that receive greater consideration are the net costs to us and our ability to effectively administer executive compensation in the short and long-term interests of stockholders.\nSection 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), generally limits a Company\u2019s ability to deduct for tax purposes compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid in any single tax year to certain executive officers (and, beginning in 2018, certain former executive officers). We expect to continue to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that we believe will attract and retain the executive talent that we need to compete successfully, even if in certain cases such compensation is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. In addition, there can be no assurance that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under Section 162(m) will in fact be deductible.\nWe account for equity compensation paid to our employees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Stock-Compensation (\u201cASC Topic 718\u201d), which requires us to estimate and record expenses for each award of equity compensation over the service period of the award.\nWe intend that our plans, arrangements and agreements will be structured and administered in a manner that complies with (or is exempt from) the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Participation in, and compensation paid under, our plans, arrangements and agreements may, in certain instances, result in the deferral of compensation that is subject to the requirements of Section 409A. If our plans, arrangements and agreements as administered fail to meet certain requirements under or exemptions from Section 409A, compensation earned thereunder may be subject to immediate taxation and tax penalties.\nSummary\nThe Compensation Committee believes that our compensation philosophy and programs are designed to foster a performance-oriented culture that aligns our named executive officers\u2019 interests with those of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee also believes that the compensation of our named executive officers is both appropriate and responsive to the goal of building stockholder value.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (\u201cCD&A\u201d) with our management. Based on this review and these discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in this Annual Report.\nThis report has been furnished by the Compensation Committee.\nSherman Tuan, Chair\nSaria Tseng\nFiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table\nThe following table sets forth information concerning the reportable compensation for our named executive officers for the fiscal years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019, as applicable.\nFISCAL YEAR 2021 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\n__________________________\n(1)Amounts disclosed under \"Salary\" for fiscal year 2021 include leave pay earned by the named executive officers.\n(2)Amounts disclosed under \u201cBonus\u201d for fiscal year 2021 reflect short-term bonuses earned by each of the named executive officers. See discussion under \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d for more information about these individualized programs.\n(3)The amount disclosed for fiscal year 2021 represents the grant date fair value of the RSU award granted during the fiscal year to the named executive officer calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718 (plus, for Mr. Hsu, the modification fair value for the continuation of the original vesting schedules for his awards outstanding as of February 28, 2021 despite his reduction in responsibilities effective March 1, 2021 (based on a deemed modification for accounting purposes)), in each case as further described in the Fiscal Year 2021 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below. Assumptions used in the calculation of this amount are included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statement and Supplementary Data\u201d, and Part II, Item 8, Note 14 \u201cStock-based Compensation and Stockholders\u2019 Equity\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(4)The amount disclosed for fiscal year 2021 represents the grant date fair value of the stock option award for each named executive officer calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718, using the Black Scholes option-pricing model (plus (A) for Mr. Bauer, the modification fair value for a modification of the post-employment termination exercise period for 70,000 in vested stock options held by Mr. Bauer as of February 25, 2021, and (B) for Mr. Hsu the modification fair value for the continuation of the original vesting schedules for his awards outstanding as of February 28, 2021 despite his reduction in responsibilities effective March 1, 2021 (based on a deemed modification for accounting purposes)), in each case as further described in the Fiscal Year 2021 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below. The amount set forth in the table above with respect to Mr. Liang\u2019s award represents our determination of probable outcome of the performance conditions embedded in the 2021 CEO Performance Award as of the date of\ngrant. If the maximum level of performance is achieved with respect to this award (in other words, if we achieve the $8.0 billion revenue target and our common stock reaches the $120.00 per share price target, the grant date fair value of the award will be $13,882,000. These amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual values that may be realized by the named executive officers, which depend, among other things, on the market value of our common stock appreciating from that on the grant dates of the options. This award was designed to be entirely an incentive for future performance that could take many years, if at all, to be achieved. Further, each of the stock price targets (starting at $45.00 and rising to $120.00) and revenue targets (starting at $4.0 billion and rising to $8.0 billion) was selected to be very difficult to achieve. If any options have not vested by the end of the term of the option award, they will be forfeited and Mr. Liang will not realize any value from such options. As of the date of this filing, none of the revenue or stock price goals has been achieved. Furthermore, the exercise price of $45.00 per share is 32% higher than the closing price of our common stock on the date the 2021 CEO Performance Award was granted AND exceeds the highest price at which our common stock has ever traded as of the date of this filing. Even if we achieve the first revenue goal of $4.0 billion and the first stock price goal of $45.00 is also met, so that the first tranche of the 2021 CEO Performance Award vests, Mr. Liang will realize no gain on the shares covered by the first tranche unless he exercises the option for the first tranche of shares and thereafter our common stock trades at a price higher than $45.00 per share. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\", and Part II, Item 8, Note 14 \u201cStock-based Compensation and Stockholders\u2019 Equity\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(5)The amount disclosed in this column for fiscal year 2021 represents for Mr. Liang $8,076,701 in Maximum Value deemed earned under a special performance-based cash incentive award opportunity granted to Mr. Liang in March 2020. See \u201cUpdate on Special Performance-Based Cash Incentive Award Granted in March 2020\u201d above for more information about this award.\n(6)Mr. Hsu served as Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer until March 2021. In March 2021, Mr. Hsu transitioned to the role of Senior Chief Executive, Strategic Business.\n(7)Mr. Bauer resigned as our Chief Financial Officer in January 2021, and Mr. Weigand has assumed such role. Mr. Bauer served as consultant after his resignation from the Company and earned $53,336 in consulting fees for fiscal year 2021.\nFiscal Year 2021 Grants of Plan-Based Awards\nThe following table provides information concerning all plan-based awards granted during fiscal year 2021 to each of our named executive officers, which grants were made under the 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan.\nFISCAL YEAR 2021 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS TABLE\n_________________________\n(1) Amounts disclosed in this column represent the fair value of the RSU and stock option awards as of the date of grant (for Mr. Liang\u2019s stock option award, based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions), computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures.\n(2) These stock options are performance-based and shall vest and become exercisable depending upon the degree of satisfaction of both the Stock Price Goals and Revenue Goals discussed above in CD&A. The Stock Price Goals must be achieved on or prior to September 30, 2026 and the Revenue Goals must be achieved on or prior to June 30, 2026. The options may vest in tranches of 200,000 shares each only when coordinating Stock Price Goals and Revenue Goals, respectively, of $45.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $4.0 billion in four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, $60.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $4.8 billion four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, $75.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $5.8 billion four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, $95.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $6.8 billion four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, and $120.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $8.0 billion four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, are achieved. The smallest\namount of these stock options (threshold) that can be earned based on performance is vested stock options for 200,000 shares for achieving a Stock Price Goal of $45.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and a Revenue Goal of $4.0 billion in four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue. However, even if those goals are achieved, if the Company\u2019s stock price remained at $45.00 per share, based on the $45.00 exercise price for these stock options, there would be no appreciation value in those stock options for Mr. Liang. For more information about the operation of this award, see \u201c2021 CEO Performance Award Granted in March 2021\u201d above.\n(3) In connection with his change in role with us effective March 1, 2021, the remaining PRSUs and unvested RSUs held by Mr. Hsu as of March 1, 2021 were deemed modified for accounting purposes. The value disclosed in this row reflects the modification fair value for the modification of Mr. Hsu\u2019s remaining PRSUs and unvested RSUs.\n(4) In connection with his change in role with us effective March 1, 2021, the unvested stock options held by Mr. Hsu as of March 1, 2021 were deemed modified for accounting purposes. The value disclosed in this row reflects the modification fair value for the modification of Mr. Hsu\u2019s unvested stock options.\n(5) In connection with his termination of employment and consulting arrangement with us, the post-employment termination exercise period for 70,000 in vested stock options held by Mr. Bauer as of February 25, 2021 was extended to expire within three months of the end of his consulting period (which is currently expected to occur on February 25, 2022). These vested stock options consisted of 8,030 stock options, 21,970 stock options, 6,400 stock options and 33,600 stock options, each at an exercise price of $28.45 per share to expire on January 25, 2027. The value disclosed in this row reflects the modification fair value for the modification of the post-employment termination exercise period for Mr. Bauer\u2019s stock options.\n(6) Reflects the grant date fair value of the 2021 CEO Performance Award, calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718, as described in footnote one. This amount does not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be realized by Mr. Liang. The 2021 CEO Performance Award is intended to compensate Mr. Liang over its 10-year maximum term and will become vested as to all shares subject to it only if the market price of our common stock increases to $120.00 per share (determined on a sixty-trading-day average) and our revenue increases to $8.0 billion over four consecutive fiscal quarters, in each case during the applicable performance period. This award was designed to be entirely an incentive for future performance that could take many years, if at all, to be achieved. Further, each of the stock price targets (starting at $45.00 and rising to $120.00) and revenue targets (starting at $4.0 billion and rising to $8.0 billion) was selected to be very difficult to achieve. If any options have not vested by the end of the term of the option award, they will be forfeited and Mr. Liang will not realize any value from such options. As of the date of this filing, none of the revenue or stock price goals has been achieved. Furthermore, the exercise price of $45.00 per share is 32% higher than the closing price of our common stock on the date the 2021 CEO Performance Award was granted AND exceeds the highest price at which our common stock has ever traded as of the date of this filing. Even if we achieve the first revenue goal of $4.0 billion and the first stock price goal of $45.00 is also met, so that the first tranche of the 2021 CEO Performance Award vests, Mr. Liang will realize no gain on the shares covered by the first tranche unless he exercises the option for the first tranche of shares and thereafter our common stock trades at a price higher than $45.00 per share.

More information concerning the terms of the employment or consulting arrangements, if applicable, in effect with our named executive officers during fiscal year 2021 is provided under the \"Employment Arrangements, Severance and Change of Control Benefits\" under the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at 2021 Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table provides information concerning the outstanding equity-based awards as of June 30, 2021, held by our named executive officers.\nOUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT 2021 FISCAL YEAR-END TABLE\n__________________________\n(1)Represents the closing stock price per share of our common stock as of June 30, 2021 ($35.18) multiplied by the number of shares underlying RSUs that had not vested as of June 30, 2021 (or, for Mr. Hsu, PRSUs that had been earned based on performance through June 30, 2021 but that had not vested as of June 30, 2021).\n(2) These stock options are performance-based and shall vest and become exercisable depending upon the degree of satisfaction of both the Stock Price Goals and Revenue Goals discussed above in CD&A. The Stock Price Goals must be achieved on or prior to September 30, 2026 and the Revenue Goals must be achieved on or prior to June 30, 2026. The options may vest in tranches of 200,000 shares each only when coordinating Stock Price Goals and Revenue Goals, respectively, of $45.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $4.0 billion in four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, $60.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $4.8 billion four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, $75.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $5.8 billion four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, $95.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $6.8 billion four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, and $120.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and $8.0 billion four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue, are achieved. The smallest amount of these stock options (threshold) that can be earned based on performance is vested stock options for 200,000 shares for achieving a Stock Price Goal of $45.00 sixty-trading-day-average stock price and a Revenue Goal of $4.0 billion in four-consecutive-fiscal-quarter revenue. However, even if those goals are achieved, if the Company\u2019s stock price remained at $45.00 per\nshare, based on the $45.00 exercise price for these stock options, there would be no appreciation value in those stock options for Mr. Liang. For more information about the operation of this award, see \u201c2021 CEO Performance Award Granted in March 2021\u201d above.\n(3) These incentive and nonqualified stock options vested at the rate of 25% on April 30, 2019 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the granted options will be fully vested on April 30, 2022.\n(4) These incentive and nonqualified stock options vested at the rate of 25% on May 1, 2021 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the granted options will be fully vested on May 1, 2024.\n(5) These RSUs vested at the rate of 25% on May 16, 2019 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the RSUs will be fully vested on May 16, 2022.\n(6) These RSUs vested at the rate of 25% on May 10, 2021 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the RSUs will be fully vested on May 10, 2024.\n(7) These incentive and nonqualified stock options vested at the rate of 25% on May 1, 2019 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the granted options will be fully vested on May 1, 2022.\n(8) These incentive and nonqualified stock options vested at the rate of 25% on October 30, 2019 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the granted options will be fully vested on October 30, 2022.\n(9) These nonqualified stock options vested at the rate of 56% on March 27, 2021 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 6% per quarter thereafter, such that the granted options will be fully vested on December 27, 2022.\n(10) These incentive stock options shall vest at the rate of 25% on October 27, 2021 and generally will vest at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the granted options will be fully vested on October 27, 2024.\n(11) These RSUs vested at the rate of 63% on May 10, 2021 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 6% per quarter thereafter, such that the RSUs will be fully vested on November 10, 2022.\n(12) These RSUs shall vest at the rate of 25% on November 10, 2021 and generally will vest at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the RSUs will be fully vested on November 10, 2024.\n(13) These incentive stock options vested at the rate of 25% on October 22, 2018 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the granted options will be fully vested on October 22, 2021.\n(14) These RSUs vested at the rate of 25% on November 16, 2018 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the RSUs will be fully vested on November 16, 2021.\n(15) These RSUs vested at the rate of 25% on May 10, 2019 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/16th per quarter thereafter, such that the RSUs will be fully vested on May 10, 2022.\n(16) This amount reflects the service-based portion of the March 2020 PRSU grant to Mr. Hsu (15,000 units). In addition to the 15,000 units, based upon the Company\u2019s revenue for fiscal year 2021 ($3,557 million), which increased from revenue for fiscal year 2020, management has calculated that 2,939 additional units were earned, such that a total of 17,939 units will vest in November 2021. Such amount remains subject to final certification by the Compensation Committee.\n(17) These nonqualified stock options vested at the rate of 20% on January 11, 2018 and vested (or generally will vest) at a rate of 1/20th per quarter thereafter, such that the granted options will be fully vested on January 11, 2022.\n(18) These nonqualified stock options shall vest at the rate of 100% on February 25, 2022.\nFiscal Year 2021 Option Exercises and Stock Vested\nThe following table sets forth the dollar amounts realized by each of our named executive officers pursuant to the exercise or vesting of equity-based awards during fiscal year 2021.\nFISCAL YEAR 2021 OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED TABLE\n__________________________\n(1)The value disclosed in this column is based on the difference between the price of our common stock at the time of exercise and the exercise price.\n(2)The values disclosed in this column are based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of vesting, multiplied by the gross number of shares vested.\nFiscal Year 2021 Pension Benefits and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation\nWe do not provide any nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements or pension plans. As such, the Pension Benefits disclosure and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation disclosure for fiscal year 2021 are omitted from this Annual Report.\nFiscal Year 2021 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control\nOther than as set forth below or described elsewhere in this Item 11, \u201cExecutive Compensation,\u201d we do not currently, and did not during fiscal year 2021 have, any arrangements with any of our named executive officers that provide for any additional or enhanced severance or other compensation or benefits in the event of termination or change of control of our Company.\nOther than with respect to the 2021 CEO Performance Award, the Company\u2019s stock option agreements generally provide for three months of exercise of vested options after termination of service, one year of exercise after disability, and one year of exercise after death. The 2021 CEO Performance Award has certain provisions related to the treatment of such award in the event of a change of control of our Company. See \u201c2021 CEO Performance Award Granted in March 2021.\u201d None of the tranches under the 2021 CEO Performance Award would have been earned thereunder for a change in control occurring on June 30, 2021 (based on the closing stock price of $35.18 on such date, plus a reasonable assumption that any aggregate consideration per share in a hypothetical change of control occurring on such date would have been less than $45), and therefore there is no change in control value attributed to the award for a hypothetical change of control situation.\nPrior to ceasing employment with the Company as Chief Financial Officer, in February 2021 Mr. Bauer entered into a consulting arrangement with the Company, and the Company provided certain provisions with respect to his equity awards following the termination of his employment relationship with the Company. See \u201c- Former CFO Consulting Arrangement.\u201d\nFiscal Year 2021 Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio\nFor fiscal year 2021, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Liang, our Chief Executive Officer (\u201c2021 CEO Compensation\u201d), to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees and those of our consolidated subsidiaries other than Mr. Liang (\u201c2021 Median Annual Compensation\u201d), was 268 to 1. For purposes of this pay ratio disclosure, 2021 CEO Compensation was determined to be $20,127,913, which represents the total compensation reported for Mr. Liang under the \u201cFiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table,\u201d plus the Company\u2019s contribution to certain non-discriminatory group health and welfare benefits provided to Mr. Liang. 2021 Median Annual Compensation for the identified median employee was determined to be $75,171, also including the Company\u2019s contribution to the same non-discriminatory group health and welfare benefits provided to the median employee.\nDue to our permitted use of reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing this pay ratio disclosure, the disclosure may involve a degree of imprecision, and thus this pay ratio disclosure is a reasonable estimate.\nTo identify the median employee, we examined our total employee population as of June 30, 2021 (the \u201cDetermination Date\u201d). We included all 2,367 U.S. full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries. We also included all 1,665 full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries in The Netherlands and Taiwan. We excluded independent contractors and \u201cleased\u201d workers. We also excluded all our employees in European countries, which together represented approximately 1% of our total employees worldwide (4,155 individuals), which countries consisted of France (8 individuals), Germany (13 individuals), Italy (5 individuals), Spain (1 individual) and United Kingdom (15 individuals). We also excluded all our employees in China (46 individuals), Japan (30 individuals), and South Korea (5 individuals), which together represented an additional approximately 2% of our total employees worldwide. Our analysis identified 4,032 individuals who were not excluded.\nTo determine the median of the annual total compensation of all of such employees, other than Mr. Liang, we generally reviewed compensation for the period beginning on July 1, 2020 and ending on the Determination Date. We totaled, for each included employee other than Mr. Liang, base earnings (salary, hourly wages and overtime, as applicable) and cash bonuses paid during the measurement period, plus the Company\u2019s contribution to group health and welfare benefits. We did not use any statistical sampling or cost-of-living adjustments for those purposes. A portion of our employee workforce (full-time and part-time) worked for less than the full fiscal year (due to mid-measurement period start dates, disability status or similar factors, etc.). In determining the median employee, we generally annualized the total compensation for such individuals other than temporary or seasonal employees (but avoided creating full-time equivalencies) based on reasonable assumptions and estimates relating to our employee compensation program.\nCompensation Program Risk Assessment\nWe have assessed our compensation programs for fiscal year 2021 and have concluded that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. We concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not encourage excessive or inappropriate risk-taking. We believe our programs are appropriately designed to encourage our employees to make decisions that result in positive short-term and long-term results for our business and our stockholders.\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n2021 Director Compensation\nUnder our director compensation policy, we reimburse non-employee directors for reasonable expenses in connection with attendance at Board and committee meetings. Charles Liang and Sara Liu, who are employees and also serve as directors, do not receive any additional compensation from us specifically for their service as directors.\nFor their service during fiscal year 2021, our non-employee directors received an annual retainer of $60,000, payable quarterly in cash. In addition, the Chairperson of our Audit Committee received an additional annual retainer of $30,000 and the Chairperson of each of our Compensation Committee and our Governance Committee received an additional annual retainer of $20,000 and $15,000, respectively, in each case payable quarterly in cash. Each director serving in a non-chairperson capacity on our Audit Committee received an additional annual retainer of $15,000, each director serving in a non-chairperson capacity on our Compensation Committee received an additional annual retainer of $10,000 and each director serving in a non-chairperson capacity on our Governance Committee received an additional annual retainer of $7,500, in each case payable quarterly in cash. Finally, non-employee directors were entitled to $2,000 per meeting for each meeting attended in excess of (1) the regular meetings of the Board and (2) up to 10 additional meetings beyond such regular meetings, provided that notice of the meeting was properly given, a quorum was present and the meeting was recorded (\u201cExcess Meetings\u201d). During fiscal year 2021, Mr. Fairfax attended 14 Excess Meetings, Mr. Tsai attended 14 Excess Meetings, Mr. McAndrews attended 11 Excess Meetings, Ms. Tseng attended three Excess Meetings, and Mr. Liu attended 15 Excess Meetings. Mr. Tuan and Mr. Chan did not attend any Excess Meetings during fiscal year 2021.\nAs disclosed in our prior Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, in March 2020, the Board provided special performance-based cash incentive award opportunities to two non-employee directors, Mr. Sherman Tuan and Mr. Fred Tsai. These awards provided a cash incentive opportunity of up to $194,150 and $103,095, respectively, subject to the following conditions: (1) 50% of the opportunity will be earned if the average closing price for the Company\u2019s common stock equals or exceeds $31.61 (representing a 15% premium over the average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding March 4, 2020) for any period of 20 consecutive trading days prior to September 30, 2021 (the \u201cFirst Price Target\u201d); and (2) an additional 50% of the opportunity will be earned if the average closing price for the Company\u2019s common stock equals or exceeds $32.99 (representing a 20% premium over the average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding March 4, 2020) for any period of 20 consecutive trading days prior to June 30, 2022 (the \u201cSecond Price Target\u201d). The relevant stock price goals were not met during fiscal year 2020, and no portion of these amounts were paid to Mr. Tuan or Mr. Tsai during fiscal year 2020, However, during fiscal year 2021, the First Price Target was achieved based upon stock price performance from December 22, 2020 through January 21, 2021, and the Second Price Target was achieved based upon stock price performance from February 8, 2021 through March 8, 2021. As a result, payment of the full amount of the cash incentive opportunities were made to each of Mr. Tuan and Mr. Tsai during fiscal year 2021.\nOur director compensation policy also provides for annual RSU grants to the non-employee directors with a value equal to $220,000, with the ultimate number of RSUs granted based on our closing stock price on the date of grant. For fiscal year 2021, we made such grants for non-employee director service under our 2020 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan on August 21, 2020 to such persons serving on such date, which grants had a vesting date of June 30, 2021. Two non-employee directors, Mr. Michael McAndrews and Mr. Fred Tsai, who served during fiscal year 2021 and received such grants, were not nominated for re-election at our annual general meeting of stockholders held on May 28, 2021 and ceased being directors on such date. Prior to the end of their service, the Compensation Committee exercised discretion to accelerate the vesting date of the awards granted to Mr. McAndrews and Mr. Tsai to May 28, 2021. Awards granted to the other non-employee directors vested on June 30, 2021.\nMr. Shiu Leung (Fred) Chan was appointed as a non-employee director on October 28, 2020. In connection with his appointment, Mr. Chan received during fiscal year 2021 a pro-rated portion of the annual non-employee director retainer and, on November 5, 2020, an RSU grant with a value equal to a pro-rated portion of $220,000 with a vesting date of June 30, 2021.\nThe following table shows for fiscal year 2021 certain information with respect to the compensation of all of our non-employee directors who served in such capacities during fiscal year 2021:\nFISCAL YEAR 2021 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n__________________________\n(1)Each of Mr. Hwei-Ming (Fred) Tsai and Mr. Michael McAndrews served as a director until May 28, 2021.\n(2) Mr. Shiu Leung (Fred) Chan was appointed to the Board in October 2020.\n(3) This column consists of annual director fees, non-employee committee chairman fees, and other committee member fees, in each case earned for fiscal year 2021.\n(4) The dollar amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair values of the RSU awards granted during fiscal year 2021 calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718. Assumptions used in the calculation of the grant date fair value amounts are included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\", and Item II, Part 8, Note 14, \u201cStock-based Compensation and Stockholders\u2019 Equity\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each grant of 8,289 RSUs to each of the directors other than Mr. Chan had a grant date fair value of $26.54 per share, and Mr. Chan\u2019s grant of 5,168 RSUs had a grant date fair value of $28.69 per share.\n(5) The value disclosed in this row under the \u201cStock Awards\u201d column also reflects, for each of Messrs. Tsai and McAndrews, the modification fair value ($67,970) for the acceleration of the vesting date of his fiscal year 2021 RSU grant from June 30, 2021 to May 28, 2021. This acceleration was approved because each of these non-employee directors was not nominated for re-election at our annual general meeting of stockholders held on May 28, 2021 and ceased being directors on such date, as further described above.\n(6) This column consists of, for Mr. Tsai and Mr. Tuan, amounts earned during fiscal year 2021 from special performance-based cash incentive award opportunities granted in March 2020 following the achievement of the performance conditions. Please see the discussion above for more information about these awards.\nThe table below sets forth the aggregate number of shares underlying stock and option awards held by our non-employee directors as of June 30, 2021.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNone of the members of the Compensation Committee is a current or former officer or employee of our Company or had any relationship with our Company requiring disclosure, except for Saria Tseng, who serves as Vice President of Strategic Corporate Development, General Counsel and Secretary of MPS, with which we have engaged in certain transactions. See \u201cPart III. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence-Transactions with Monolithic Power Systems.\u201d In addition, during fiscal year 2021, none of our executive officers served as a member of the compensation committee of the board of directors of any other entity that has one or more executive officers who served on our Compensation Committee of the Board. Hwei-Ming (Fred) Tsai, Saria Tseng and Sherman Tuan served on the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2021, with Mr. Tsai\u2019s service on such committee ending on May 28, 2021.",

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nProcedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions\nPursuant to our Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee has the responsibility for the review and approval of any related person transactions; provided that if the matter or transaction involves employment or compensation terms for services to our company, including retention or payment provisions relating to expert services, then it is presented to the Compensation Committee. In approving or rejecting a proposed transaction, or a relationship that encompasses many similar\ntransactions, our Audit Committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant, including but not limited to the risks, costs and benefits to us, the terms of the transaction, the availability of other sources for comparable services or products, and, if applicable, the impact on a director\u2019s independence. Our Audit Committee approves only those transactions that, in light of known circumstances are not inconsistent with our best interests, as the Audit Committee determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion. In addition, we annually require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions as such term is defined by SEC rules and regulations. These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.\nTransactions with Related Parties, Promoters and Certain Control Persons\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\nWe have entered into agreements to indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law.

We have agreed to pay for the cost of chassis and related product tooling and engineering services and will pay for those items when the work has been completed.\nWe entered into a distribution agreement with Compuware, under which we appointed Compuware as a non-exclusive distributor of our products in Taiwan, China and Australia. We believe that the pricing and terms under the distribution agreement are similar to the pricing and terms of distribution arrangements we have with similar third-party distributors.\nWe have also entered into a series of agreements with Compuware, including a multiple product development, production and service agreements, product manufacturing agreements, and lease agreements for office space.

We pay Compuware for the design and engineering services, and further agree to pay Compuware for the tooling.\nWe retain full ownership of any intellectual property resulting from the design of these products and tooling. With respect to the manufacturing aspects of the relationship, Compuware purchases most of materials needed to manufacture the power supplies from outside markets and uses these materials to manufacture the products and then sell to us. We review and frequently negotiate with Compuware the prices of the power supplies that we purchase from Compuware. Compuware also manufactures motherboards, backplanes and other components used on our printed circuit boards. We sell to Compuware most of the components needed to manufacture the above products. Compuware uses these components to manufacture and then sells back the products to us at a purchase price equal to the price at which we sold the components to Compuware, plus a \u201cmanufacturing value added\u201d fee and other miscellaneous material charges and costs. We frequently review and negotiate with Compuware the amount of the \u201cmanufacturing value added\u201d fee that will be included in the price of the products we purchase from Compuware.\nAblecom\u2019s sales to us comprise a substantial majority of Ablecom\u2019s net sales.

Amounts owed to us by Compuware as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, were $18.4 million and $14.3 million, respectively.

In exchange for this discount, Compuware assumes the responsibility to install our products at the site of the end customer and administers first-level customer support. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we purchased products from Compuware totaling $113.4 million, $130.6 million and $138.9 million, respectively.

Our outstanding purchase orders to Ablecom were $40.2 million and $23.2 million at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing the maximum exposure to financial loss. We do not directly or indirectly guarantee any obligations of Ablecom, or any losses that the equity holders of Ablecom may suffer.\nOur exposure to financial loss as a result of our involvement with Compuware is limited to potential losses on our purchase orders in the event of an unforeseen decline in the market price and/or demand for our products such that we incur a loss on the sale or cannot sell the products.

The loan is unsecured, has no maturity date and bore interest at 0.8% per month for the first six months, increased to 0.85% per month through February 28, 2020, and reduced to 0.25% effective March 1,\n2020. The loan was originally made at Mr. Liang's request to provide funds to repay margin loans to two financial institutions, which loans had been secured by shares of our common stock that he held. The lenders called the loans in October 2018, following the suspension of our common stock from trading on NASDAQ in August 2018 and the decline in the market price of our common stock in October 2018. As of June 30, 2021, the amount due on the unsecured loan (including principal and accrued interest) was approximately $15.3 million.\nTransactions with Monolithic Power Systems\nMPS is a supplier that provides high-performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors for use in our products. Saria Tseng, who serves as a member on the Board of Directors, also serves as Vice President of Strategic Corporate Development, General Counsel and Secretary of MPS. We purchased $3.9 million, $5.2 million and $3.7 million of semiconductor products from MPS for use in our manufacturing process during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts due to MPS as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 were not material.",
