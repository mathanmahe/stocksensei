The Company serves customers in eight states, including portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Xcel Energy provides a comprehensive portfolio of energy-related products and services to approximately 3.8 million electric customers and 2.2 million natural gas customers through four utility subsidiaries (i.e., NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS). Along with the utility subsidiaries, the transmission-only subsidiaries, WYCO (a joint venture formed with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage and compression facilities) and WGI (an interstate natural gas pipeline company) comprise the regulated utility operations. The Company\u2019s nonregulated subsidiaries include Eloigne, Capital Services, Venture Holdings and Nicollet Project Holdings.\nService Territory\nStrategy\nXcel Energy\u2019s vision is to be the preferred and trusted provider of the energy our customers need. We will deliver on this vision while offering a competitive total return to shareholders. Our mission is to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy services they want and value at a competitive price.\nWe execute on our vision and mission through three strategic priorities.\nLEAD THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE KEEP BILLS LOW\nOur employees are guided by four corporate values: Connected, Committed, Safe, and Trustworthy.\nOur values, culture and Code of Conduct serve as the foundation upon which Xcel Energy\u2019s employees, Board of Directors, contractors and suppliers approach their work in delivering on our three strategic priorities.\nDeliver a Competitive Total Return to Investors\nSuccessful strategy execution, along with our disciplined approach to growth, operations and management of environmental, social and governance issues, positions us to continue delivering a competitive TSR.\nWe have consistently achieved our financial objectives, meeting or exceeding our initial ongoing earnings guidance range for 19 consecutive years and delivering dividend growth for 21 consecutive years.\nOver the past five years, ongoing earnings per share have grown annually by 6.3% and our dividend per share by 6.5% annually. Xcel Energy works to maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range and senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range.\nLEAD THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION\nXcel Energy manages the risk of climate change and has worked to meet the increasing demand for cleaner energy for over 20 years.\nOur sustainability commitments are summarized as follows:\n*Companywide goal; work also underway to meet state clean energy goals in our service area.\n**Spans natural gas supply, delivery and customer use.\n***Includes Xcel Energy fleet; zero-carbon fuel is carbon free electricity or other clean energy.\nCarbon-free Electricity by 2050\nXcel Energy was the first U.S. utility to establish a carbon-free vision, targeting 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 with an interim goal to reduce carbon emissions 80% by 2030 (from 2005 levels), including owned and purchased power. A lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that our vision aligns with science-based scenarios likely to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, in alignment with the Paris Climate Accords.\nThe pace of achieving a carbon-free vision is also governed by reliability and customer affordability. Our approved resource plans outline a clear, transparent path for reducing carbon emissions by 80% using current technologies, while maintaining customer bill increases at or below the rate of inflation. Moving from 80% carbon reduction to 100% carbon-free electricity will require new, dispatchable technologies that are economically viable, as well as supportive public policy.\nSee Item 1A for risks and uncertainties related to strategic and sustainability goals and objectives.\nXcel Energy\u2019s operating footprint includes some of the best wind and solar resources in the country, providing for higher capacity factors and lower operating costs. Our \u201cSteel for Fuel\u201d strategy reduces costs for our customers by taking advantage of these higher capacity factors along with savings provided by renewable tax credits and avoided fuel costs that mitigate higher cost fossil generation.\nThrough 2023, we reduced carbon emissions from generation serving customers by an estimated 54% (from 2005 levels) and remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction and fully exit coal by the end of 2030. At the same time, our Steel for Fuel strategy has saved customers nearly $4 billion since 2017.\nXcel Energy\u2019s wind capacity is now over 11,000 MW, including nearly 4,500 MW of owned wind. In Colorado, we anticipate adding an additional 1,850 MW of wind, 1,700 MW of solar, 1,850 MW of storage and 650 MW of gas generation to ensure reliability on our system by 2028. In Minnesota, we have approvals for more than 700 MW of new solar at our Sherco facility, making it one of the largest solar facilities in the country. In 2024, we filed our NSP Resource Plan, which proposes adding 3,600 MW of new wind and solar, 600 MW of battery storage and 2,200 MW of dispatchable resources by 2030, pending Commission approval. In SPS, we filed for approval of 400 MW of solar generation, a 200 MW PPA and a broader system IRP, which could include between 5,000 to 10,000 MW of new generation by 2030.\nBeyond carbon, we have significantly reduced other emissions and environmental impacts, including:\n*Reductions in water consumption are from owned and purchased electricity that serves our customers. All other reductions are from owned generating plants.\n**Coal ash and water consumption data are as of 2022.\nAs we prepare for early coal plant retirements, employees are provided advanced notice and offered retraining and relocation opportunities. To date, we have been successful in avoiding layoffs associated with our early coal plant retirements. We also help foster economic development opportunities to offset community impacts associated with coal plant closures. Xcel Energy has a long track record of working with our communities on energy, climate and environmental initiatives that impact them and has publicly committed to furthering environmental justice.\nSignificant investment in our transmission and distribution systems is essential to ensure resiliency and reliability for customers through the clean energy transition. We have nearly $12 billion in our 2024 - 2028 capital plan focused specifically on this, including our $1.7 billion Pathway project in Colorado, and additional investments to further support our recently approved Colorado resource portfolio. As part of MISO\u2019s planned transmission expansion over the next decade, Xcel Energy has been awarded $1.2 billion of projects as part of Tranche 1. We anticipate MISO Tranche 2 awards in 2024.\nNatural Gas Use in Buildings - Net-Zero GHG by 2050\nXcel Energy is committed to reducing GHG emissions 25% by 2030 (from 2020 levels) and provide net-zero natural gas service by 2050 from the supply, distribution and end-use of natural gas. In 2023, we filed our Clean Heat Plan in Colorado and Natural Gas Innovation Plan in Minnesota, which provide a framework for this transition.\nSimilar to our electric plan, the lead author for the IPCC confirmed our vision to deliver natural gas service with net-zero emissions by 2050 aligns with science-based scenarios likely to limit global warming by 1.5 C.\nOur net-zero natural gas frameworks include the following priorities:\n\u2022Work with suppliers to purchase only low emissions gas by 2030.\n\u2022Operate the cleanest possible system to achieve net-zero methane emissions on the system by 2030.\n\u2022Offer customer options for conservation, beneficial electrification, and clean fuels such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas.\n\u2022Apply high-quality carbon offsets through projects that remove emissions while providing additional environmental and social benefit.\nElectrification of the Transportation Sector\nWe are also helping reduce carbon emissions in other sectors, including transportation. We aim to enable one out of five vehicles in our service areas to be electric by 2030, representing nearly $2 billion of investment, 0.6% - 0.7% of average incremental annual retail sales growth and avoidance of roughly 5 million tons of CO2 emissions annually. By 2050, our vision is to run all vehicles in our service area with carbon-free electricity or other clean energy. We have approved, transportation electrification programs and plans in Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota and Wisconsin and updated transportation plans pending commission approval in Minnesota and Colorado.\nInnovation and Policy\nIn 2023, the Department of Energy announced awards of nearly $1.5 billion to support multiple Xcel Energy affiliated projects. The Heartland Hydrogen Hub, which includes multiple projects from Xcel Energy and others in the Upper Midwest, received an award of up to $925 million by the DOE. This funding will serve as a catalyst for a clean hydrogen ecosystem in the region. The DOE also awarded Xcel Energy up to $70 million to support our two 10-MW, 100-hour battery pilots with Form Energy. Combined with grants committed by Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, we have secured up to $90 million to support these long duration energy storage pilots, a critical asset class to ensure cost effective reliability in a high-renewable grid.\nXcel Energy was selected as part of two different awards from the DOE\u2019s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership program. The DOE awarded Xcel Energy $100 million to support projects to mitigate the threat of wildfires and ensure resiliency of the grid through extreme weather. Xcel Energy was also party to GRIP\u2019s $464 million grant to expand transmission as part of the MISO and SPP program to fund high-voltage transmission to improve inter-regional transfer capability, reliability and resolve grid constraints.\nXcel Energy actively engages in wildfire mitigation activities across our operating territories. For the past three years, we have operated under a commission-approved wildfire plan in Colorado. We are currently evaluating updates to these plans with a wide range of options for consideration including new technologies, undergrounding, additional vegetation management, composite poles, selective use of covered conductor and preventative power system shutoffs.\nSustainability Governance and Oversight\nIn 2000, we instituted oversight of environmental performance by the Board of Directors and were among the first U.S. energy providers to tie carbon reduction to executive compensation more than 15 years ago.\nXcel Energy has provided a voluntary, third-party verified annual GHG disclosure since 2005, longer than any other U.S. utility. We are a founding member of The Climate Registry and a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Our disclosures also align with the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals frameworks.\nENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE\nXcel Energy has invested more than $2 billion over the past decade in a portfolio of renewable and conservation programs that provide customers with clean energy options and help keep bills low. New demand remains robust in our territories, including load growth from new data centers, industrial electrification and electric vehicle adoption. As such, we are transforming and expanding our electric grid to accommodate load growth, renewable energy and distributed energy resources.\nWe are in the process of installing smart electric meters, which will deliver customer and operational benefits, providing near-real-time communication, allowing customers to know how much energy they are using and what it will cost. In addition, customers will have new digital tools to make it easier to access their energy information, gain useful insights to understand and manage their energy use and make energy choices that lower their bills.\nKEEP BILLS LOW\nCustomer affordability is critical to successful strategy execution. From 2014 - 2023, we have kept residential electric bill growth to 1.8% per year and natural gas bill growth to 1.1% per year, both below the rate of inflation. Based on available EIA data, the five year average residential electric and natural gas bills for an Xcel Energy customer were 28% and 14% below the national average, respectively.\nGoing forward, our goal is to enable the clean energy transition while keeping customer bill growth below the rate of inflation through initiatives including conservation programs, O&M cost control, our One Xcel Energy Way lean management initiative, advanced operational technologies and our Steel for Fuel program.\n*Based on 2019 - Q3 2023 EIA Data\nSTRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES\nWe provide a fundamental service, powering communities with safe, reliable, competitively priced and increasingly clean energy.\nInvesting in our communities is important to our collective success. We initiated 18 economic development projects for our local communities in 2023, which are projected to create more than $2.3 billion in capital investments and 1,400 jobs. Nearly 63% of our supply chain spend was local, with approximately $638 million spent with diverse suppliers.\nApproximately 300 employees served on more than 530 nonprofit organizations or local community boards, providing over 28,000 volunteer hours in 2023. Our annual Day of Service attracted 2,500 people who volunteered over 7,200 combined hours at over 120 nonprofit projects across the company\u2019s service footprint.\nIn 2023, the Xcel Energy Foundation contributed $4 million to 409 nonprofit organizations that support its three charitable giving focus areas of STEM Career Pathways, Environmental Sustainability, and Community Vitality. Through our 2023 Power Your Purpose Giving Campaign, Xcel Energy employees, contractors and retirees donated more than $2 million to over 1,300 nonprofit and community organizations - exceeding our fundraising goal. Combined with the Xcel Energy Foundation match to local United Way chapters, this campaign raised over $4 million for our communities.\nVALUE PEOPLE AND OPERATE WITH INTEGRITY\nChampion Safety\nContinuously elevating the quality and safety of the workplace is a top priority. We are considered a benchmark company for our Safety Always approach, focused on eliminating life-altering injuries through a trusted, transparent culture and the use of critical controls. All employees have \u201cstop work authority\u201d and are expected to keep each other, our customers and the public safe. Employees are encouraged to speak up, share experiences and learn from events to help protect themselves, their coworkers and the public.\nThe Board of Directors has oversight for employee and public safety through the Operations, Nuclear, Environmental and Safety committee, both of which are also tied to annual incentive compensation.\nCultivate a Diverse, Best-in-Class Workforce\nWe aim to create an inclusive culture where employees are treated equitably, and diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. This starts with our Board of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors oversees our workforce strategy, including diversity and inclusion initiatives. Xcel Energy has an incentive-based metric focused on diverse interview panels, executive sponsorship and employee feedback on inclusion in the workplace.\nA total of 70% of annual incentive compensation was tied to safety, system reliability and inclusion metrics.\nManagement evaluates compensation and benefits to maintain a market-competitive, performance-based, shareholder-aligned total rewards package that supports our ability to attract, engage and retain a talented and diverse workforce, while reinforcing and rewarding strong performance.\nWe partner with educational and community organizations to attract and hire employees who reflect the communities we serve and live our values. Xcel Energy had 11,311 full-time employees and workforce demographics as of December 2023 were as follows:\nWe offer leaders and employees training on microinequities and unconscious bias to help foster a culture of inclusivity. Xcel Energy hosts 12 business resource groups to support employee interests and obtain diverse perspectives when solving challenges and achieving goals.\nXcel Energy also respects employees\u2019 freedom of association and their right to collectively organize.

Sales true-up and decoupling mechanisms mitigate the impacts of weather in certain jurisdictions.\nCompetition\nXcel Energy is subject to public policies that promote competition and development of energy markets. Xcel Energy\u2019s industrial and large commercial customers have the ability to generate their own electricity. In addition, customers may have the option of substituting other fuels or relocating their facilities to a lower cost region.\nCustomers have the opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation including solar generation and can currently avoid paying for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them in most jurisdictions.\nSeveral states have incentives for the development of rooftop solar, community solar gardens and other distributed energy resources. Distributed generating resources are potential competitors to Xcel Energy\u2019s electric service business with these incentives and federal tax subsidies.\nThe FERC has continued to promote competitive wholesale markets through open access transmission and other means. Xcel Energy\u2019s wholesale customers can purchase energy from generation resources of competing generation resources quantities and transmission services from other service providers to serve their native load.\nFERC Order No. 1000 established competition for ownership of certain new electric transmission facilities under Federal regulations. Some states have state laws that allow the incumbent a Right of First Refusal to own these transmission facilities.\nFERC Order 2222 requires that RTO and ISO markets allow participation of aggregations of distributed energy resources. This order is expected to incentivize distributed energy resource adoption, however implementation is expected to vary by RTO/ISO and the near, medium, and long-term impacts of Order 2222 remain unclear.\nXcel Energy Inc.\u2019s utility subsidiaries have franchise agreements with cities subject to periodic renewal; however, a city could seek alternative means to access electric power or gas, such as municipalization. No municipalization activities are occurring presently.\nWhile each utility subsidiary faces these challenges, Xcel Energy believes their rates and services are competitive with alternatives currently available.\nGovernmental Regulations\nPublic Utility Regulation\nSee Item 7 for discussion of public utility regulation.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nOur facilities are regulated by federal and state agencies that have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous wastes or substances. Certain Xcel Energy activities require registrations, permits, licenses, inspections and approvals from these agencies.\nXcel Energy has received necessary authorizations for the construction and continued operation of its generation, transmission and distribution systems. Our facilities strive to operate in compliance with applicable environmental standards and related monitoring and reporting requirements.\nHowever, it is not possible to determine what additional facilities or modifications to existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes to regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or what effect future laws or regulations may have. We may be required to incur expenditures in the future for remediation of historic and current operating sites and other waste treatment, storage and disposal sites.\nThere are significant environmental regulations to encourage use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. We have undertaken numerous initiatives to meet current requirements and prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. Future environmental regulations may result in substantial costs.\nEmerging Environmental Regulation\nClean Air Act\nPower Plant Greenhouse Gas Regulations - In May 2023, the EPA published proposed rules addressing control of CO2 emissions from the power sector. The rule proposed regulations for new natural gas generating units and emission guidelines for existing coal and certain natural gas generation. The proposed rules create subcategories of coal units based on planned retirement date and subcategories of natural gas combustion turbines and combined cycle units based on utilization. The CO2 control requirements vary by subcategory. Until final rules are issued, it is not certain what the impact will be on Xcel Energy. Xcel Energy believes that the cost of these initiatives or replacement generation would be recoverable through rates based on prior state commission practices.\nCoal Ash Regulation\nIn May 2023, the EPA published proposed rules to regulate legacy CCR surface impoundments at inactive facilities and previously exempt areas where CCR was placed directly on land at regulated CCR facilities under the CCR Rule for the first time. The proposed rule would subject these areas to the CCR Rule requirements, including groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, and post-closure care requirements, among other requirements, with several of the deadlines accelerated.\nThe EPA has committed to a May 2024 publication date for those new rules. It is also anticipated that the EPA may issue other CCR proposed rules in 2024 and 2025 that further expand the scope of the CCR Rule. Until final rules are issued, it is not certain what the impact will be on Xcel Energy. Xcel Energy believes that the cost of these initiatives would be recoverable through rates based on prior state commission practices.\nEmerging Contaminants of Concern\nPFAS are man-made chemicals that are widely used in consumer products and can persist and bio-accumulate in the environment. Xcel Energy does not manufacture PFAS but because PFAS are so ubiquitous in products and the environment, it may impact our operations.\nIn September 2022, the EPA proposed to designate two types of PFAS as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under the CERCLA. In March 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule that would establish enforceable drinking water standards for certain PFAS chemicals. Final rules are expected in 2024. Costs are uncertain until a final rule is published.\nThe proposed rules could result in new obligations for investigation and cleanup. Xcel Energy is monitoring changes to state laws addressing PFAS. The impact of these proposed regulations is uncertain.\nEffluent Limitation Guidelines\nIn March 2023, the EPA released a proposed rule under the Clean Water Act, setting forth proposed Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for steam generating coal plants. This proposed rule establishes more stringent wastewater discharge standards for bottom ash transport water, flue-gas desulfurization wastewater, and combustion residuals leachate from steam electric power plants, particularly coal-fired power plants. The impact of these proposed regulations is uncertain until a final rule is published.\nEnvironmental Costs\nEnvironmental costs include amounts for nuclear plant decommissioning and payments for storage of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites, monitoring of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to emissions.\nCosts charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning, spent nuclear fuel disposal, environmental monitoring and remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and waste and depreciation of previously incurred capital expenditures for environmental improvements were approximately:\n\u2022$275 million in 2023.\n\u2022$365 million in 2022.\n\u2022$365 million in 2021.\nAverage annual expense of approximately $320 million from 2024 - 2028 is estimated for similar costs. The precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be recovered through rates may fluctuate.\nCapital expenditures for environmental improvements were approximately:\n\u2022$20 million in 2023.\n\u2022$20 million in 2022.\n\u2022$60 million in 2021.\nCertain previously collected nuclear storage costs for the federal nuclear waste program are reimbursed to customers by the federal government as a result of a settlement we pursued regarding the government\u2019s failure to deliver a disposal program. Installments received are reimbursed to customers as approved by the MPUC and other state regulators.\nOther\nOur operations are subject to workplace safety standards under the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (\u201cOSHA\u201d) and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of worker health and safety. In addition, the Company is subject to other government regulations impacting such matters as labor, competition, data privacy, etc. Based on information to date and because our policies and business practices are designed to comply with all applicable laws, we do not believe the effects of compliance on our operations, financial condition or cash flows are material.\nCapital Spending and Financing\nSee Item 7 for discussion of capital expenditures and funding sources.\n(a) No family relationships exist between any of the executive officers or directors.\n(b)In April 2014, Energy Future Holdings Corp., the majority of its subsidiaries, including Texas Competitive Energy Holdings the parent company of Luminant, filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Texas Competitive Energy Holdings emerged from Chapter 11 in October 2016.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nXcel Energy is subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control. Risks that may adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. These risks should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and future reports that we file with the SEC.\nWhile we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.\nOversight of Risk and Related Processes\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of material risk and maintaining an effective risk monitoring process. Management and the Board of Directors\u2019 committees have responsibility for overseeing the identification and mitigation of key risks and reporting its assessments and activities to the full Board of Directors.\nXcel Energy maintains a robust compliance program and promotes a culture of compliance beginning with the tone at the top. The risk mitigation process includes adherence to our Code of Conduct and compliance policies, operation of formal risk management structures and overall business management. Xcel Energy further mitigates inherent risks through formal risk committees and corporate functions such as internal audit, and internal controls over financial reporting and legal.\nManagement identifies and analyzes risks to determine materiality and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. Identification and risk analysis occurs formally through risk assessment conducted by senior management, the financial disclosure process, hazard risk procedures, internal audit and compliance with financial and operational controls.\nManagement also identifies and analyzes risk through the business planning process, development of goals and establishment of key performance indicators, including identification of barriers to implementing Xcel Energy\u2019s strategy. The business planning process also identifies likelihood and mitigating factors to prevent the assumption of inappropriate risk to meet goals.\nManagement communicates regularly with the Board of Directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. Senior management presents and communicates a periodic risk assessment to the Board of Directors, providing information on the risks that management believes are material, including financial impact, timing, likelihood and mitigating factors. The Board of Directors regularly reviews management\u2019s key risk assessments, which includes areas of existing and future macroeconomic, financial, operational, policy, environmental, safety and security risks.\nThe oversight, management and mitigation of risk is an integral and continuous part of the Board of Directors\u2019 governance of Xcel Energy. The Board of Directors assigns oversight of critical risks to each of its four committees to confirm these risks are well understood and given appropriate focus.\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the adequacy of the committees\u2019 risk oversight and affirming appropriate aggregate oversight occurs. Committees regularly report on their oversight activities and certain risk issues may be brought to the full Board of Directors for consideration when deemed appropriate.\nEmerging risks are considered and assigned as appropriate during the annual Board of Directors and committee evaluation process, resulting in updates to the committee charters and annual work plans. Additionally, the Board of Directors conducts an annual strategy session where Xcel Energy\u2019s future plans and initiatives are reviewed.\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nOperational Risks\nOur natural gas and electric generation/transmission and distribution operations involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\nOur natural gas transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions, outages and mechanical problems. Our electric generation, transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and outages.\nThese risks could result in loss of life, significant property damage, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses to employees, third-party contractors, customers or the public. We maintain insurance against most, but not all, of these risks and losses.\nThe occurrence of these events, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as potential loss of reputation.\nOther uncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining Xcel Energy's facilities include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned.\n\u2022Failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other supplies.\n\u2022Impact of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including, tornadoes, avalanches, icing events, floods, high winds and droughts.\n\u2022Performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency.\n\u2022Availability of replacement equipment.\n\u2022Availability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirements.\n\u2022Availability or changes to wind patterns.\n\u2022Inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects.\n\u2022Use of new or unproven technology.\n\u2022Risks associated with dependence on a specific type of fuel or fuel source, such as commodity price risk, availability of adequate fuel supply and transportation and lack of available alternative fuel sources.\n\u2022Increased competition due to, among other factors, new facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes.\nAdditionally, compliance with existing and potential new regulations related to the operation and maintenance of our natural gas infrastructure could result in significant costs. The PHMSA is responsible for administering the DOT\u2019s national regulatory program to assure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines. The PHMSA continues to develop regulations and other approaches to risk management to assure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. We have programs in place to comply with these regulations and systematically monitor and renew infrastructure over time, however, a significant incident or material finding of non-compliance could result in penalties and higher costs of operations.\nOur natural gas and electric transmission and distribution operations are dependent upon complex information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could disrupt our normal business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to process transactions and provide services.\nOur utility operations are subject to long-term planning and project risks.\nMost utility investments are planned to be used for decades. Transmission and generation investments typically have long lead times and are planned well in advance of in-service dates and typically subject to long-term resource plans. These plans are based on numerous assumptions such as: sales growth, customer usage, commodity prices, economic activity, costs, regulatory mechanisms, customer behavior, available technology and public policy. Xcel Energy\u2019s long-term resource plan is dependent on our ability to obtain required approvals (including regulatory approval in jurisdictions where Xcel Energy operates), develop necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources and adhere to budgets and timelines.\nIn addition, the long-term nature of both our planning processes and our asset lives are subject to risk. The utility sector is undergoing significant change (e.g., increases in energy efficiency, wider adoption of distributed generation and shifts away from fossil fuel generation to renewable generation). Customer adoption of these technologies and increased energy efficiency could result in excess transmission and generation resources, downward pressure on sales growth, and potentially stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments.\nThe magnitude and timing of resource additions and changes in customer demand may not coincide with evolving customer preference for generation resources and end-uses, which introduces further uncertainty into long-term planning. Efforts to electrify the transportation and building sectors to reduce GHG emissions may result in higher electric demand and lower natural gas demand over time. New data centers and crypto mining facilities could generate significant increase in demand. Higher electric demand may require us to adopt new technologies and make significant transmission and distribution investments including advanced grid infrastructure, which increases exposure to overall grid instability and technology obsolescence. Evolving stakeholder preference for lower emissions from generation sources and end-uses, like heating, may impact our resource mix and put pressure on our ability to recover capital investments in natural gas generation and delivery. Multiple states may not agree as to the appropriate resource mix, which may lead to costs to comply with one jurisdiction that are not recoverable across all jurisdictions served by the same assets.\nWe require inputs such as coal, natural gas, uranium and water. Lack of availability of these resources could jeopardize long-term operations of our facilities or make them uneconomic to operate.\nOur utilities are highly dependent on suppliers to deliver components in accordance with short and long-term project schedules.\nOur products contain components that are globally sourced from suppliers. A shortage of key components in which an alternative supplier is not identified could significantly impact operations and project plans for Xcel Energy and our customers. Such impacts could include timing of projects and the potential for project cancellation. Failure to adhere to project budgets and timelines could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are subject to commodity risks and other risks associated with energy markets and energy production.\nA significant increase in fuel costs could cause a decline in customer demand, adverse regulatory outcomes and an increase in bad debt expense which may have a material impact on our results of operations. Despite existing fuel cost recovery mechanisms in most of our states, higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations if costs are not recovered. Delays in the timing of the collection of fuel cost recoveries could impact our cash flows and liquidity.\nA significant disruption in supply could cause us to seek alternatives at potentially higher costs. Additionally, supply shortages may not be fully resolved, which negatively impacts our ability to provide services to our customers. Failure to provide service due to disruptions may also result in fines, penalties or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. Also, significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to sales commitments negatively impacts our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe also engage in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity, energy and energy-related products as well as natural gas. In many markets, emission allowances and/or RECs are also needed to comply with various statutes and commission rulings. As a result, we are subject to market supply and commodity price risk.\nCommodity price changes can affect the value of our commodity trading derivatives. We mark certain derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily basis. Settlements can vary significantly from estimated fair values recorded and significant changes from the assumptions underlying our fair value estimates could cause earnings variability. The management of risks associated with hedging and trading is based, in part, on programs and procedures which utilize historical prices and trends.\nPublic perception often does not distinguish between pass through commodity costs and base rates. High commodity prices that are passed through to customer bills could impact our ability to recover costs for other improvements and operations.\nDue to the uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from historical pricing, Xcel Energy is unable to fully assure that its risk management programs and procedures would be effective to protect against all significant adverse market deviations.\nIn addition, Xcel Energy cannot fully assure that its controls will be effective against all potential risks. If such programs and procedures are not effective, Xcel Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially impacted.\nFailure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on operations.\nThe competition for talent has become increasingly prevalent, and we have experienced increased employee turnover due to the condition of the labor market and decisions related to strategic workforce planning. In addition, specialized knowledge and skills are required for many of our positions, which may pose additional difficulty for us as we work to recruit, retain and motivate employees in this climate.\nFailure to hire, adequately train replacement employees, transfer knowledge/expertise or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. Inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur businesses have collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Failure to renew or renegotiate these contracts could lead to labor disruptions, including strikes or boycotts. Such disruptions or any negotiated wage or benefit increases could have a material adverse impact to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nNational unionization efforts could affect our business, as an increase in unionized workers could challenge our operational efficiency and increase costs.\nOur operations use third-party contractors in addition to employees to perform periodic and ongoing work.\nWe rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance and construction work. Our contractual arrangements with these contractors typically include performance and safety standards, progress payments, insurance requirements and security for performance. Poor vendor performance or contractor unavailability could impact ongoing operations, restoration operations, regulatory recovery, our reputation and could introduce financial risk or risks of fines.\nOur employees, directors, third-party contractors, or suppliers may violate or be perceived to violate our Codes of Conduct, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nWe are exposed to risk of employee or third-party contractor fraud or misconduct. All employees and members of the Board of Directors are subject to compliance with our Code of Conduct and are required to participate in annual training. Additionally, suppliers are subject to compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct.\nXcel Energy does not tolerate discrimination, violations of our Code of Conduct or other unacceptable behaviors. However, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third-parties, which may result in governmental investigations, other actions or lawsuits. If such actions are taken against us we may suffer loss of reputation and such actions could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur subsidiary, NSP-Minnesota, is subject to the risks of nuclear generation.\nNSP-Minnesota has two nuclear generation plants, PI and Monticello. Risks of nuclear generation include:\n\u2022Hazards associated with the use of radioactive material in energy production, including management, handling, storage and disposal.\n\u2022Limitations on insurance available to cover losses that may arise in connection with nuclear operations, as well as obligations to contribute to an insurance pool in the event of damages at a covered U.S. reactor.\n\u2022Technological and financial uncertainties related to the costs of decommissioning nuclear plants may cause our funding obligations to change.\nThe NRC has authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, including the ability to impose fines and/or shut down a unit until compliance is achieved. NRC safety requirements could necessitate substantial capital expenditures or an increase in operating expenses. In addition, the INPO reviews NSP-Minnesota\u2019s nuclear operations. Compliance with the INPO\u2019s recommendations could result in substantial capital expenditures or a substantial increase in operating expenses.\nIf a nuclear incident did occur, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Furthermore, non-compliance or the occurrence of a serious incident at other nuclear facilities could result in increased industry regulation, which may increase NSP-Minnesota\u2019s compliance costs.\nFinancial Risks\nOur profitability depends on the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover their costs and changes in regulation may impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs from their customers.\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge customers.\nThe profitability of our utility operations is dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services and earn a return on capital investment. Our rates are generally regulated and are based on an analysis of the utility\u2019s costs incurred in a test year. The utility subsidiaries are subject to both future and historical test years depending upon the regulatory jurisdiction. Thus, the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its costs at any given time. Rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\nThere can also be no assurance that our regulatory commissions will judge all the costs of our utility subsidiaries to be prudent, which could result in disallowances, or that the regulatory process will always result in rates that will produce full recovery.\nOverall, management believes prudently incurred costs are recoverable given the existing regulatory framework. However, there may be changes in the regulatory environment that could impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from customers, or these subsidiaries could exceed caps on capital costs required by commissions and result in less than full recovery.\nChanges in the long-term cost-effectiveness or to the operating conditions of our assets may result in early retirements of utility facilities. While regulation typically provides cost recovery for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs.\nHigher than expected inflation or tariffs may increase costs of construction and operations. Also, rising fuel costs could increase the risk that our utility subsidiaries will not be able to fully recover their fuel costs from their customers.\nAdverse regulatory rulings (including changes in recovery mechanisms) or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and materially affect our ability to meet our financial obligations, including debt payments and the payment of dividends on common stock.\nAny reductions in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.\nOur credit ratings are subject to change and our credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency. Significant events including disallowance of costs, use of historic test years, elimination of riders or interim rates, increasing depreciation lives, lower returns on equity, changes to equity ratios and impacts of tax policy may impact our cash flows and credit metrics, potentially resulting in a change in our credit ratings. In addition, our credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies.\nAny credit ratings downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs or lower proceeds from equity issuances. It could also impact our ability to access capital markets. Also, our utility subsidiaries may enter into contracts that require posting of collateral or settlement if credit ratings fall below investment grade.\nWe are subject to capital market and interest rate risks.\nUtility operations require significant capital investment. As a result, we frequently need to access capital markets. Any disruption in capital markets could have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations. Capital market disruption and financial market distress could prevent us from issuing commercial paper, issuing new securities or cause us to issue securities with unfavorable terms and conditions, such as higher interest rates or lower proceeds from equity issuances. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe performance of capital markets impacts the value of assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission NSP-Minnesota\u2019s nuclear plants and satisfy our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected returns. A decline in the market value of these assets may increase funding requirements. Additionally, the fair value of the debt securities held in the nuclear decommissioning and/or pension trusts may be impacted by changes in interest rates.\nWe are subject to credit risks.\nCredit risk includes the risk that our customers will not pay their bills, which may lead to a reduction in our cash flow and liquidity and an increase in bad debt expense. Credit risk is comprised of numerous factors including the price of products and services provided, the economy and unemployment rates.\nCredit risk also includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or product will become insolvent and may breach their obligations. Should the counterparties fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected and incur losses.\nXcel Energy may have direct credit exposure in our short-term wholesale and commodity trading activity to financial institutions trading for their own accounts or issuing collateral support on behalf of other counterparties. We may also have some indirect credit exposure due to participation in organized markets, (e.g., MISO, SPP, ERCOT and California Independent System Operator), in which any credit losses are socialized to all market participants.\nWe have additional indirect credit exposure to financial institutions from letters of credit provided as security by power suppliers under various purchased power contracts. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the supplier would need to replace that security with an acceptable substitute. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract.\nIncreasing costs of our defined benefit retirement plans and employee benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that cover most of our employees. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements of these plans. Estimates and assumptions may change. In addition, the Pension Protection Act sets the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans. Therefore, our funding requirements and contributions may change in the future.\nAlso, the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year, due to high numbers of retirements or employees leaving, would trigger settlement accounting and could require Xcel Energy to recognize incremental pension expense related to unrecognized plan losses in the year liabilities are paid. Changes in industry standards utilized in key assumptions (e.g., mortality tables) could have a significant impact on future obligations and benefit costs.\nIncreasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreasing levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Health care legislation could also significantly impact our benefit programs and costs.\nWe must rely on cash from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments.\nInvestments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Substantially all our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our operating cash flow and ability to service our debt and pay dividends depends upon the operating cash flows of our subsidiaries and their payment of dividends.\nOur subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for dividends on our common stock. In addition, each subsidiary\u2019s ability to pay dividends depends on statutory and/or contractual restrictions which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of equity ratios, working capital or assets.\nIf the utility subsidiaries were to cease making dividend payments, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or otherwise meet our financial obligations could be adversely affected. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated by state utility commissions, which possess broad powers to prioritize that the needs of the utility customers are met. We may be negatively impacted by the actions of state commissions that limit the payment of dividends by our utility subsidiaries.\nFederal tax law may significantly impact our business.\nOur utility subsidiaries collect estimated federal, state and local tax payments through their regulated rates. Changes to federal tax law may benefit or adversely affect our earnings and customer costs. Tax depreciable lives and the value/availability of various tax credits or the timeliness of their utilization may impact the economics or selection of resources. If tax rates are increased, there could be timing delays before regulated rates provide for recovery of such tax increases in revenues. In addition, certain IRS tax policies, such as tax normalization, may impact our ability to economically deliver certain types of resources relative to market prices.\nMacroeconomic Risks\nEconomic conditions impact our business.\nXcel Energy\u2019s operations are affected by economic conditions, which correlates to customers/sales growth (decline). Economic conditions may be impacted by recessionary factors, rising interest rates and insufficient financial sector liquidity leading to potential increased unemployment, which may impact customers\u2019 ability to pay their bills, which could lead to additional bad debt expense.\nOur utility subsidiaries face competitive factors, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, worldwide economic activity impacts the demand for basic commodities necessary for utility infrastructure, which may inhibit our ability to acquire sufficient supplies. We operate in a capital-intensive industry and federal trade policy could significantly impact the cost of materials we use. There may be delays before these additional material costs can be recovered in rates.\nThe oil and gas industry represents our largest commercial and industrial customer base. Oil and natural gas prices are sensitive to market risk factors which may impact demand.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which may have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHealth epidemics impact countries, communities, supply chains and markets. Uncertainty continues to exist regarding epidemics; the duration and magnitude of business restrictions including shutdowns (domestically and globally); the potential impact on the workforce including shortages of employees and third-party contractors due to quarantine policies, vaccination requirements or government restrictions; impacts on the transportation of goods, and the generalized impact on the economy.\nWe cannot ultimately predict whether an epidemic will have a material impact on our future liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Nor can we predict the impact on the health of our employees, our supply chain or our ability to recover higher costs associated with managing an outbreak.\nOperations could be impacted by war, terrorism or other events.\nOur generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities and information and control systems may be targets of terrorist activities. Any disruption could impact operations or result in a decrease in revenues and additional costs to repair and insure our assets. These disruptions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe potential for terrorism has subjected our operations to increased risks and could have a material effect on our business. We have incurred increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks. The insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the availability of insurance may decrease. In addition, insurance may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.\nA disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, interstate natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business, brand and reputation. Because our facilities are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the actions of a neighboring utility.\nWe also face the risks of possible loss of business due to significant events such as severe storms, temperature extremes, wildfires (particularly in Colorado), widespread pandemic, generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, railroad disruption, operator error, sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation or a workforce disruption.\nIn addition, major catastrophic events throughout the world may disrupt our business. While we have business continuity plans in place, our ability to recover may be prolonged due to the type and extent of the event. Xcel Energy participates in a global supply chain, which includes materials and components that are globally sourced. A prolonged disruption could result in the delay of equipment and materials that may impact our ability to connect, restore and reliably serve our customers.\nA major disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues, additional costs to repair assets, and an adverse impact on the cost and availability of insurance, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nA cybersecurity incident or security breach could have a material effect on our business.\nWe operate in an industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology, control systems and network infrastructure. In addition, we use our systems and infrastructure to create, collect, use, disclose, store, dispose of and otherwise process sensitive information, including Company data, customer energy usage data, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, shareholders and other individuals.\nXcel Energy\u2019s generation, transmission, distribution and fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure or physical assets as well as information processed in our systems (e.g., information regarding our customers, employees, operations, infrastructure and assets) could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, including those caused by human error.\nThe utility industry has been the target of several attacks on operational systems and has seen an increased volume and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents from international activist organizations, other countries and individuals. We expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations.\nCybersecurity incidents could harm our businesses by limiting our generation, transmission and distribution capabilities, delaying our development and construction of new facilities or capital improvement projects to existing facilities, disrupting our customer operations or causing the release of customer information, all of which would likely receive state and federal regulatory scrutiny and could expose us to liability.\nXcel Energy\u2019s generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cybersecurity incident on the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources of our third-party service providers\u2019 operations, could also negatively impact our business.\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence, such as large language models like ChatGPT, present a range of challenges and potential risks as we consider impacts to the business. These challenges involve navigating the complexities of creating and deploying AI models that generate content autonomously. Data privacy, legal concerns, and security issues are all risks as this technology continues to be adopted.\nOur supply chain for procurement of digital equipment and services may expose software or hardware to these risks and could result in a breach or significant costs of remediation. We are unable to quantify the potential impact of cybersecurity threats or subsequent related actions. Cybersecurity incidents and regulatory action could result in a material decrease in revenues and may cause significant additional costs (e.g., penalties, third-party claims, repairs, insurance or compliance) and potentially disrupt our supply and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.\nWe maintain security measures to protect our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets. However, these assets and the information they process may be vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents, including asset failure or unauthorized access to assets or information.\nA failure or breach of our technology systems or those of our third-party service providers could disrupt critical business functions and may negatively impact our business, our brand, and our reputation. The cybersecurity threat is dynamic and evolves continually, and our efforts to prioritize network protection may not be effective given the constant changes to threat vulnerability.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damages experienced. Also, the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.\nOur operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by milder weather.\nOur electric and natural gas utility businesses are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand depends heavily upon weather patterns. A significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. Unusually mild winters and summers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPublic Policy Risks\nIncreased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our business.\nThe Energy Act increased civil penalty authority for violation of FERC statutes, rules and orders. FERC can impose penalties of up to $1.5 million per violation per day, particularly as it relates to energy trading activities for both electricity and natural gas. In addition, NERC electric reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection requirements are mandatory and subject to potential financial penalties. Also, the PHMSA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to assess penalties.\nIn the event of serious incidents, these agencies may pursue penalties. In addition, certain states have the authority to impose substantial penalties. If a serious reliability, cybersecurity or safety incident did occur, it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe continued use of natural gas for both power generation and gas distribution have increasingly become a public policy advocacy target. These efforts may result in a limitation of natural gas as an energy source for both power generation and heating, which could impact our ability to reliably and affordably serve our customers.\nIn recent years, there have been various local and state agency proposals within and outside our service territories that would attempt to restrict the use and availability of natural gas. If such policies were to prevail, we may be forced to make new resource investment decisions which could potentially result in stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments and impact the overall reliability of our service.\nEnvironmental Policy Risks\nWe may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.\nLegislative and regulatory responses related to climate change may create financial risk as our facilities may be subject to additional regulation at either the state or federal level in the future. International agreements could additionally lead to future federal or state regulations.\nIn 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reached consensus among 190 nations on an agreement (the Paris Agreement) that establishes a framework for GHG mitigation actions by all countries, with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2\u00ba Celsius above pre-industrial levels and an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5\u00ba Celsius.\nInternational commitments and agreements could result in future additional GHG reductions in the United States. In addition, in 2023 the EPA intends to publish draft regulations for GHG emissions from the power sector consistent with the agency\u2019s Clean Air Act authorities.\nMany states and localities continue to pursue their own climate policies. The steps Xcel Energy has taken to date to reduce GHG emissions, including energy efficiency measures, adding renewable generation and retiring or converting coal plants to natural gas, occurred under state-endorsed resource plans, renewable energy standards and other state policies.\nWe may be subject to climate change lawsuits. An adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures and possibly require payment of substantial penalties or damages. Defense costs associated with such litigation can also be significant and could affect results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nIf our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the O&M costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and the generation, transport and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous substances. Laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, licenses, and approvals and to comply with a variety of environmental requirements.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of facilities or the use of certain fuels, shift generation to lower-emitting facilities, install pollution control equipment, clean up spills and other contamination and correct environmental hazards. Failure to meet requirements of environmental mandates may result in fines or penalties. We may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where our past activities, or the activities of other parties, caused environmental contamination.\nChanges in environmental policies and regulations or regulatory decisions may result in early retirements of our generation facilities. While regulation typically provides relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs.\nWe are subject to mandates to provide customers with clean energy, renewable energy and energy conservation offerings. It could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if our regulators do not allow us to recover the cost of capital investment or O&M costs incurred to comply with the requirements.\nIn addition, existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new laws or regulations may be adopted. We may also incur additional unanticipated obligations or liabilities under existing environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other weather, natural disaster and resource depletion impacts.\nClimate change can create physical and financial risk. Physical risks include changes in weather conditions and extreme weather events. Our customers\u2019 energy needs vary with weather. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers\u2019 energy use could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in generating assets, transmission and infrastructure. Decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues.\nClimate change may impact the economy, which could impact our sales and revenues. The price of energy has an impact on the economic health of our communities. The cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation of GHG, could impact the availability of goods and prices charged by our suppliers which would normally be borne by consumers through higher prices for energy and purchased goods.\nTo the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of GHGs as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.\nWe establish strategies and expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters. Our ability to achieve any such strategies or expectations is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include, but are not limited to, evolving legal, regulatory, and other standards, processes, and assumptions, the pace of scientific and technological developments, increased costs, the availability of requisite financing, and changes in carbon markets. Failures or delays (whether actual or perceived) in achieving our strategies or expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation, and increase risk of litigation.\nSevere weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, flooding, tornadoes, wildfires and snow or ice storms or extreme temperatures (high heating/cooling days) occur. Extreme weather conditions in general require system backup and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise electricity prices, increasing the cost of energy we provide to our customers.\nTo the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service and result in more frequent service interruptions. Periods of extreme temperatures could also impact our ability to meet demand.\nMore frequent and severe drought conditions, extreme swings in amount and timing of precipitation, changes in vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, very low humidity, stronger winds and other factors have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the potential impact of an event. Also, the expansion of the wildland urban interface increases the wildfire risk to surrounding communities and Xcel Energy's electric and natural gas infrastructure.\nOther potential risks associated with wildfires and other climate events include the inability to secure sufficient insurance coverage, or increased costs of insurance, regulatory recovery risk, and the potential for a credit downgrade and subsequent additional costs to access capital markets.\nWhile we carry liability insurance, given an extreme event, if Xcel Energy was found to be liable for wildfire damages, amounts that potentially exceed our coverage could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nDrought or water depletion could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers, cause early retirement of power plants and increase the cost for energy. Adverse events may result in increased insurance costs and/or decreased insurance availability. We may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.",

    "item_1C": "ITEM 1C - CYBERSECURITY\nAs described in Item 1A - Risk Factors, Xcel Energy operates in an industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology, control systems and network infrastructure, as such, our business is subject to the risk of interruption by cybersecurity incidents that range from attacks common to most industries, such as phishing and denial-of-service, to attacks from more sophisticated adversaries, including nation state actors, that target the critical infrastructure used in the operation of our business.\nThe Company has a security risk program in place to identify, assess, manage and report material risks from cybersecurity incidents. As a utility provider, Xcel Energy complies with reliability standards imposed by NERC, including critical infrastructure protection standards related to both cybersecurity and physical security. These standards imposed by NERC, in alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, are the basis for which Xcel Energy has designed the cybersecurity control framework within its security risk program.\nAnnually, as part of Xcel Energy\u2019s enterprise risk program, an integrated cybersecurity risk identification and assessment is completed across Xcel Energy\u2019s business, including generation, transmission, distribution and fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure or physical assets as well as information processed in our systems (including systems hosted by third parties) that could be affected by cybersecurity incidents. This analysis includes the impact, likelihood, timeframe and controllability of cybersecurity risks and is presented to the Board of Directors. Management monitors and reviews the results of this analysis, integrating them into the enterprise risk assessment processes and implements appropriate mitigating actions as needed.\nXcel Energy\u2019s cybersecurity policies, standards, practices and readiness are regularly assessed by third-party consultants. These partners are engaged to perform independent penetration testing and other security related services to assist in the prevention, detection, monitoring, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents and risks. The results of these assessments are communicated to management and the Board of Directors by the Chief Security Officer.\nXcel Energy employs a comprehensive risk based approach to assess the magnitude and significance of a vendor\u2019s risk to the Company. Certain third-party service providers are subject to vendor security risk assessments at the time of integration, contract execution/renewal, and upon detection of any increase in risk profile. Xcel Energy uses a variety of inputs in such risk assessments, including information supplied by providers and third parties (including information analysis centers that share daily threat intelligence and improve organizational agility associated with management of cybersecurity risks). In addition, the Company requires certain third-party service providers to meet appropriate security requirements, controls and responsibilities. The Company deploys periodic monitoring activities to assess compliance with our cybersecurity control framework and investigates security incidents that have impacted our third-party service providers as appropriate.\nManagement has assigned responsibility for the security risk program to the Chief Security Officer who has extensive experience in critical infrastructure protection, including multiple years of experience with the Department of Defense. The Chief Security Officer is informed about and monitors prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation efforts through a team of security professionals, many of whom are Certified Information Systems Security Professionals, Certified Information Security Managers or have received other cybersecurity certifications. The team has extensive experience selecting, deploying and operating cybersecurity technologies, initiatives and processes that aid in preventing, remediating and mitigating known and unknown cybersecurity threats.\nThe Chief Security Officer or members of management brief the Board on routine and regular cybersecurity risk and threat updates, typically on a quarterly basis. In the event of a significant threat or incident, management and the Chief Security Officer leverage Xcel Energy\u2019s incident response processes to assess impacts and resolve incidents. When a significant cybersecurity incident occurs, management communicates with the Board of Directors and relevant committees.\nThe Board of Directors oversees the risks associated with cybersecurity and the physical security of our assets, with information security matters being discussed at each regular board meeting as well as at the ONES and Audit Committee meetings throughout the year.\nWhile the ONES Committee has primary committee responsibility for cybersecurity due to the operational issues involved, the Board of Directors has determined that the topic is of sufficient importance to warrant this comprehensive oversight approach. Augmenting such oversight efforts, the Board of Directors conducts drills to practice its response in a possible emergency situation to ensure it is well prepared and positioned to perform in a possible crisis.\nCybersecurity risks are a part of Xcel Energy\u2019s normal course of business. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations. As of Feb. 21, 2024 there have been no material cybersecurity incidents to report.",

    "item_7": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing ROE, ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company\u2019s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that is adjusted from measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nXcel Energy\u2019s management uses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining performance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement investors\u2019 understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies\u2019 similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.\nOngoing ROE\nOngoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity\u2019s average stockholder\u2019s equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.\nEarnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)\nGAAP diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method. Ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP earnings (net income) for certain items. Ongoing diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of each subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of Xcel Energy\u2019s core earnings and underlying performance. For instance, to present ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted earnings per share, we may adjust the related GAAP amounts for certain items that are non-recurring in nature. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings (net income) to ongoing earnings:\n(a)Amounts may not add due to rounding.\nComanche Unit 3 Litigation - In the third quarter of 2023, PSCo recognized a $34 million loss due to a jury verdict in Denver County District Court awarding CORE lost power damages and other costs. PSCo intends to file an appeal of this decision. Given the non-recurring nature of this specific item, it has been excluded from ongoing earnings.\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nWorkforce Reduction - In 2023, Xcel Energy implemented workforce actions to align resources and investments with our evolving business and customer needs, and streamline the organization for long-term success. Xcel Energy initiated a voluntary retirement program, under which approximately 400 eligible non-bargaining employees retired. Xcel Energy also eliminated approximately 150 non-bargaining employees through an involuntary severance program.\nTotal workforce reduction expenses of $72 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. Given the non-recurring nature of this item, it has been excluded from ongoing earnings.\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nResults of Operations\nDiluted EPS for Xcel Energy at Dec. 31:\n(a)Amounts may not add due to rounding.\nXcel Energy\u2019s management believes that ongoing earnings reflects management\u2019s performance in operating Xcel Energy and provides a meaningful representation of the performance of Xcel Energy\u2019s core business. In addition, Xcel Energy\u2019s management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, reporting results to the Board of Directors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.\n2023 Comparison with 2022\nXcel Energy - GAAP diluted earnings were $3.21 per share compared to $3.17 per share in 2022 and ongoing diluted earnings were $3.35 per share in 2023, compared with $3.17 per share in 2022. The increase in ongoing earnings per share was driven by increased recovery of infrastructure investments, higher sales and demand and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and interest charges and unfavorable weather.\nFluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased power and/or natural gas sold and transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in costs are offset by the related variation in revenues).\nNSP-Minnesota - GAAP earnings increased $0.05 per share and ongoing earnings increased $0.09 per share for 2023 compared to 2022. The change to ongoing earnings was driven by increased recovery of electric infrastructure investments, partially offset by increased interest charges and unfavorable weather.\nPSCo - GAAP earnings decreased $0.07 per share and ongoing earnings was flat for 2023 compared to 2022. Ongoing earnings primarily reflects higher recovery of infrastructure investment and lower O&M expenses, which were partially offset by increased depreciation, interest charges and unfavorable weather.\nSPS - GAAP earnings increased $0.06 per share and ongoing earnings increased $0.07 per share for 2023 compared to 2022. Ongoing earnings were largely impacted by regulatory rate outcomes, sales growth, partially offset by increased depreciation, interest charges and unfavorable weather.\nNSP-Wisconsin - GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.02 per share for 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in ongoing earnings was primarily a result of higher recovery of electric infrastructure investment, partially offset by unfavorable weather and, higher depreciation, O&M expenses and interest charges.\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other - Primarily includes financing costs and interest income at the holding company and earnings from EIP funds equity method investments. Fluctuations from 2022 levels were largely attributable to increased interest rates.\nChanges in Diluted EPS\nComponents significantly contributing to changes in EPS:\nROE for Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries:\nStatement of Income Analysis\nThe following summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of income.\nEstimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings - Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements.\nAs a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy\u2019s financial performance. However, electric decoupling mechanisms in Colorado (mechanism expired in September 2023) and electric sales true-up mechanisms in Minnesota and gas decoupling mechanism in Minnesota predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather in those jurisdictions.\nDegree-day or THI data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day\u2019s average temperature and humidity.\nHDD is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. CDD is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\nEach degree of temperature above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one CDD, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one HDD.\nIn Xcel Energy\u2019s more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD. HDD, CDD and THI are most likely to impact the usage of Xcel Energy\u2019s residential and commercial customers. Industrial customers are less sensitive to weather.\nNormal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized estimates.\nPercentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI:\nWeather - Estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with normal weather conditions:\nSales - Sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales:\nAnnual weather-normalized electric sales growth (decline)\n\u2022NSP-Minnesota - Residential sales increased due to a 1.2% increase in customers outpacing declines in use per customer. The decline in C&I sales was due to lower use per customer, particularly due to weakness in the manufacturing sector compared to prior year.\n\u2022PSCo - Residential sales increased due to increased use per customer and a 1.3% increase in customers. The decline in C&I sales was attributable to decreased use per customer, primarily in the manufacturing sector.\n\u2022SPS - Residential sales growth was primarily attributable to a 0.7% increase in customers and increased use per customer. C&I sales increased due to higher use per customer, primarily driven by the energy sector.\n\u2022NSP-Wisconsin - The C&I sales decline was associated with lower use per customer, experienced primarily in the transportation and manufacturing sectors.\nAnnual weather-normalized natural gas sales growth (decline)\n\u2022Natural gas sales reflect 1.2% residential and 0.7% C&I customer growth and an increase in C&I use per customer at PSCo. Partially offsetting these increases were lower use per residential customer in all jurisdictions.\nElectric Margin\nElectric margin is presented as electric revenues less electric fuel and purchased power expenses. Expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms.\nAs a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.\nElectric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium. These price fluctuations generally have minimal impact on earnings impact due to fuel recovery mechanisms. In addition, electric customers receive a credit for PTCs generated, which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.\nElectric Revenues, Fuel and Purchased Power and Electric Margin\nChange in Electric Margin\n(a)Sales excludes weather impact, net of partial decoupling in Colorado (mechanism expired in September 2023) and sales true-up mechanism in Minnesota.\n(b)The decline in electric margin is due to the recognition of the Texas rate case outcome in the second quarter of 2022, which was largely offset by recognition of previously deferred costs.\nNatural Gas Margin\nNatural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported. Expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas sold are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.\nNatural gas expense varies with changing sales and the cost of natural gas. However, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas generally have minimal earnings impact due to cost recovery mechanisms.\nNatural Gas Revenues, Cost of Natural Gas Sold and Transported and Natural Gas Margin\nChange in Natural Gas Margin\nNon-Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items\nO&M Expenses - O&M expenses decreased $47 million in 2023, primarily due to the impact of management cost containment efforts, the exit of our appliance repair services business and the change in deferred costs associated with the Texas Electric Rate Cases (offset in Electric revenues), offset by higher bad debt expenses, the impact of inflationary pressures, including labor, and timing of unplanned maintenance at generating plants.\nDepreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization increased $35 million for the year, primarily related to system expansion, offset by the change in deferred costs associated with the Texas Electric Rate Case and depreciation life extensions implemented in the Minnesota Electric Rate Case.\nTaxes (other than Income Taxes) -Taxes (other than income taxes) decreased $31 million in 2023, primarily due to lower property tax expense (lower tax rates in Minnesota offset by increase in Colorado) and deferrals related to the Minnesota Electric Rate Case and Texas Electric Rate Case.\nOther Income (Expense) - Other income (expense) increased $35 million for the year, primarily related to rabbi trust performance, which is primarily offset in employee benefit cost in O&M expenses.\nInterest Charges - Interest charges increased $102 million in 2023. The increase was largely due to higher long-term debt levels to fund capital investments and higher interest rates.\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other Results\nNet income and diluted EPS contributions of Xcel Energy Inc. and its nonregulated businesses:\n(a)Amounts include gains or losses associated with EIP investments.\nXcel Energy Inc.\u2019s results include interest charges, which are incurred at Xcel Energy Inc. and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries.\n2022 Comparison with 2021\nA discussion of changes in Xcel Energy\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and capital resources from the year ended Dec. 31, 2021 to Dec. 31, 2022 can be found in Part II, \u201cItem 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2022, which was filed with the SEC on Feb. 23, 2023. However, such discussion is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPublic Utility Regulation\nThe FERC and various state and local regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s utility subsidiaries and West Gas Interstate. Xcel Energy is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.\nRates are designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Our utility subsidiaries request changes in utility rates through commission filings. Changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energy\u2019s financial results, depending on the timing of rate cases and implementation of final rates. Other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales, conservation and DSM efforts, and the cost of capital.\nIn addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the ROE, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy\u2019s results of operations and credit quality.\nSee Rate Matters and Other within Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nNSP-Minnesota\nSummary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\nRecovery Mechanisms\n(a)Minnesota state law requires NSP-Minnesota to spend 2% of its state electric revenues and 0.5% of its state natural gas revenues on CIP. These costs are recovered through an annual cost-recovery mechanism.\nPending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings\n2022 Minnesota Electric Rate Case - In October 2021, NSP-Minnesota filed a three-year electric rate case with the MPUC. The rate request was based on a ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and forward test years. In December 2021, the MPUC approved interim rates, subject to refund, of $247 million, effective Jan. 1, 2022. In November 2022, NSP-Minnesota revised its rate request to $498 million over three years.\nIn July 2023, the MPUC approved a three-year rate increase of approximately $332 million for 2022-2024, based on a ROE of 9.25% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. The MPUC also approved a continuation of the sales true-up mechanism.\nIn October 2023, the MPUC denied NSP-Minnesota\u2019s request for reconsideration of certain aspects of the decision. NSP-Minnesota filed an appeal of the decision to the Minnesota Court of Appeals in November 2023.\n2024 Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case - In November 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the MPUC for an annual natural gas rate increase of approximately $59 million, or 9.6%. The request is based on a ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 forward test year with rate base of approximately $1.27 billion. In Dec. 2023, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota\u2019s request for interim rates, subject to refund, of approximately $51 million (implemented on Jan. 1, 2024).\nNext steps in the procedural schedule are expected to be as follows:\n\u2022Intervenor direct testimony: April 19, 2024\n\u2022Rebuttal testimony: May 24, 2024\n\u2022Evidentiary hearings: July 10-12, 2024\n\u2022ALJ Report: October 28, 2024\n\u2022MPUC Order Due: March 14, 2025\n2024 North Dakota Natural Gas Rate Case - In December 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the NDPSC for an annual natural gas rate increase of approximately $8 million, or 9.4%. The filing is based on a ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 forecast test year with rate base of approximately $168 million. NSP-Minnesota requested interim rates, subject to refund, of approximately $8 million to be implemented on March 1, 2024.\nNuclear Power Operations\nNuclear power plant operations produce gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes, which are covered by federal regulation. High-level radioactive wastes primarily include used nuclear fuel. Low-level waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment contaminated through use.\nNRC Regulation - The NRC regulates nuclear operations. Costs of complying with NRC requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital investments of the plants. NSP-Minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs and expects to recover future compliance costs.\nLow-Level Waste Disposal - Low level waste from Monticello and PI is disposed of at the Clive facility located in Utah and the Waste Control Specialists facility in Texas. NSP-Minnesota has storage capacity available on-site at PI and Monticello which would allow both plants to continue to operate until the end of their current licensed lives if off-site low-level waste disposal facilities become unavailable.\nHigh-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal - The federal government has responsibility to permanently dispose of domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the DOE to implement a program for nuclear high-level waste management.\nThis includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive wastes at a permanent federal storage or disposal facility. Currently, there are no definitive plans for a permanent federal storage facility site.\nNuclear Spent Fuel Storage - NSP-Minnesota has interim on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear generating plants. Authorized storage capacity is sufficient to allow NSP-Minnesota to operate until the end of the current operating licenses in 2030 for Monticello, 2033 for PI Unit 1, and 2034 for PI Unit 2.\nIn February 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a CON with the MPUC for additional storage at PI to support possible life extension to 2054.\nIn October 2023, the MPUC issued an order approving NSP-Minnesota\u2019s application for a CON for additional spent fuel storage (existing Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation) at the Monticello Nuclear Power Generating Plant to allow continued operation of the Monticello Plant until 2040.\nAuthorizations for additional spent fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either continued operation or decommissioning if the federal government does not commence storage operations.\nNSP-Wisconsin\nSummary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\nRecovery Mechanisms\nRecently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings\nWisconsin Rate Case - In 2023, NSP-Wisconsin filed a Wisconsin rate case seeking a revised electric increase of $25 million and a natural gas increase of $7 million. The filing was based on a 2024 forecast test year, a ROE of 10.25%, an equity ratio of 52.5% and a forecasted average net rate base of approximately $2.1 billion for the electric utility and $284 million for the natural gas utility.\nIn December 2023, the PSCW approved a ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 52.5% as well as a rate increase of approximately $1 million for the electric utility. Adjustments to NSP-Wisconsin\u2019s rate request included removal of a proposed residential affordability program and other earnings neutral adjustments and fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW also approved a $5 million rate increase for the natural gas utility in 2024. The new rates were implemented on Jan. 1, 2024.\nNSP System\nPending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings\n2022 Upper Midwest IRP Resource Acquisition - Following the MPUC\u2019s approval of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin\u2019s latest IRP in April 2022, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have been engaged in multiple resource acquisition processes and proceedings to meet the need identified in the IRP for the NSP System.\n\u2022In August 2022, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin jointly filed an RFP seeking at least 900 MW of solar or solar plus storage capacity. In May 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a recommended portfolio, which proposed an additional 250 MW of self-build solar generation at the site of our retiring Sherco coal units and a 100 MW solar PPA located in Wisconsin as part of the resource plan RFP. In September 2023, the MPUC approved the request for 350 MW, subject to a cost cap based on projected costs for the Sherco solar project.\n\u2022In the second quarter of 2023, NSP-Minnesota initiated the process with the MPUC for acquisition of 800 MW of firm dispatchable resources. In January 2024, NSP-Minnesota and other companies submitted proposed resources. NSP-Minnesota expects a decision by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\u2022In July 2023, NSP-Wisconsin issued an RFP seeking approximately 650 MW of solar and/or solar plus storage development assets that will be developed in the 2027-2029 timeframe to replace the capacity from the retiring King Generating Station. The RFP closed in September 2023 and bids are being evaluated.\n\u2022In October 2023, NSP-Minnesota issued an RFP seeking approximately 1,200 MW of wind development assets to replace capacity and reutilize interconnection rights associated with the retiring Sherco coal facilities. The RFP closed in December 2023 and the NSP-Minnesota expects to file for approval of recommended projects by mid-2024.\n2024 Upper Midwest Energy Plan - In February 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed its resource plan with the MPUC. Key components of the plan include the following:\n\u2022Reduced carbon emissions by more than 80%, potentially up to 88%, by 2030.\n\u2022Extends the operation of Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear plants through the early 2050s.\n\u2022Adds 3,600 MW of new wind and solar resources by 2030.\n\u2022Adds 600 MW of battery energy storage by 2030.\n\u2022Adds more than 2,200 MW of dispatchable resources by 2030.\nNSP-Minnesota anticipates a MPUC decision in 2025.\nPurchased Power and Transmission Services\nThe NSP System expects to use power plants, power purchases, conservation and DSM options, new generation facilities and expansion of power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.\nPurchased Power - Through the Interchange Agreement, NSP-Wisconsin receives power purchased by NSP-Minnesota from other utilities and independent power producers. Long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require a capacity charge and an energy charge. NSP-Minnesota makes short-term purchases to meet system requirements, replace company owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\nPurchased Transmission Services - NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts with MISO and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.\nWholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\nNSP-Minnesota conducts wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy-related products. NSP-Minnesota uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price risk and to hedge sales and purchases.\nNSP-Minnesota also engages in trading activity unrelated to these hedging activities. Sharing of any margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement. NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin do not serve any wholesale requirements customers at cost-based regulated rates.\nPSCo\nSummary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\nRecovery Mechanisms\nPending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings\nColorado Electric Rate Case - In 2022, PSCo filed a Colorado electric rate case seeking a revised net increase of $253 million. The total request reflected a $303 million increase, which includes $50 million of authorized costs previously recovered through various rider mechanisms. The request was based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.7% and a 2023 forecast test year with a 2023 average rate base of $11.3 billion.\nIn September 2023, the CPUC approved a settlement between PSCo and various parties, which included the following terms:\n\u2022Retail revenue increase (excluding rider roll-ins) of $95 million (2.96%), based on a 2022 historic test year using year-end rate base with forward looking known and measurable adjustments.\n\u2022Weighted-average cost of capital of 6.95% (based on 55.69% equity ratio and 9.3% ROE).\n\u2022Termination of the revenue decoupling pilot.\n\u2022Continuation of previously authorized trackers and deferrals.\nRates became effective in September 2023.\nColorado Resource Plan - In August 2022, the CPUC approved a settlement for the Colorado Resource Plan, which provides for an expected carbon reduction and the retirement of PSCo\u2019s remaining coal plant by the end of 2030.\nIn September 2023 (updated in October 2023), PSCo filed its recommended Preferred Portfolio of resources, which proposed a total of 7,521 MW of generation resources, including 4,716 owned MW and 2,805 purchased power MW. The filing also included several other alternative portfolios.\nIn December 2023, the CPUC approved an alternative portfolio of 5,835 MW. The decision provides an opportunity to assess timing and levels of incremental renewable resources in the Just Transition Plan filing expected to be submitted by June 1, 2024.\nApproved portfolio includes the following resources:\nPSCo expects to invest approximately $4.8 billion in generation resources under the alternative portfolio for the benefit of its customers and achieving the state\u2019s clean energy goals. The CPUC did not approve the May Valley to Longhorn Transmission Line, which was estimated at $250 million.\nIn December 2023, the CPUC approved two PIMs associated with the generation projects in the portfolio, including a two-way sharing measure related to capital construction costs and another related to ongoing levelized energy costs. These PIMs will be further defined in the written order and related proceedings throughout 2024.\nIn February 2024, PSCo filed an ARRR to seek approval for an updated portfolio, reflecting inclusion of certain back-up bids and clarifications of the application of PIMs.\nColorado Natural Gas Rate Case - In January 2024, PSCo filed a request with the CPUC seeking an increase to retail natural gas rates of $171 million, or an approximately 9.5% increase in the average residential customer bill. The request is based on a 2023 test year, a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55% and a $4.2 billion retail rate base which includes projected capital additions through Dec. 31, 2023. PSCo has requested a proposed effective date of Nov. 1, 2024.\nPSCo has proposed to defer collection of the increased rates until Feb. 15, 2025 (following the expiration of the rider to recover Winter Storm Uri costs) to mitigate customer bill impacts, with revenues for the deferred period collected over a 12-month period beginning on that date.\nThe request supports fundamental infrastructure investments to serve customers, consistent with PSCo\u2019s obligation to provide safe, reliable service while enabling PSCo to continue to be a leader of the clean energy transition in partnership with the CPUC to achieve clean heat goals.\n(a)Includes approximately $32 million as a result of the increase in ROE from 9.2% to 10.25%.\nECA Fuel Recovery - In December 2022, PSCo filed to recover $123 million of under-recovered 2022 fuel costs over two quarters. In December 2022, the CPUC found that the $123 million should be removed from the proposed ECA rates, and required PSCo to file a separate application to recover these costs.\nIn 2023, PSCo submitted interim ECA filings to recover $70 million and $25 million, respectively, of the 2022 under-recovered costs.\nIn the third quarter, PSCo and CPUC Staff filed a settlement allowing for collection of the remaining amount, which after final adjustments was $37 million. In December 2023, the ALJ issued a recommended decision approving the settlement in full. Recovery of costs is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2024.\nColorado Legislation - In May 2023, Colorado Senate Bill 23-291 passed and was signed into law. The bill includes a number of topics including natural gas and electric fuel incentive mechanisms, natural gas planning rules, regulatory filing requirements, and non-recovery of certain expenses (e.g., certain organizational or membership dues, tax penalties or fines).\nIn November 2023, the CPUC approved PSCo\u2019s natural gas price risk management plan, establishing upper and lower limits for changes in the GCA rate. As a result costs above the upper limit are deferred for future recovery, with interest, and costs below the lower limit are deferred as a reserve against future cost increases.\nThe legislation also calls for the CPUC to adopt rules to establish fuel cost mechanisms to align the financial incentives of a utility with the interests of the utility\u2019s customers by Jan. 1, 2025. The CPUC issued a request for initial comments on a potential mechanism under which gas utilities would share a percentage, subject to an annual cap, of cost changes in the GCA. A formal rulemaking is expected to commence in the first half of 2024.\nPurchased Power and Transmission Service Providers\nPSCo meets its system capacity and energy requirements through its fleet of owned and purchased electric generation resources and, when required, the use of demand-side management programs.\nPurchased Power - PSCo purchases power from other utilities, energy marketers and independent power producers. Long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require capacity and energy charges. Much of PSCo\u2019s long-term purchased power is for wind, solar and storage resources. PSCo makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation out of service for maintenance, meet operating reserve obligations, or obtain energy at a lower cost.\nEnergy Markets - PSCo joined the SPP Western Energy Imbalance Service Market in April 2023. This market is an incremental step in the participation in an organized wholesale market. Energy imbalance markets allow participants to buy and sell power close to the time electricity is consumed and gives system operators real-time visibility across neighboring grids. The result improves balancing supply and demand at a lower cost.\nPurchased Transmission Services - In addition to using its own transmission system, PSCo has contracts with regional transmission service providers to deliver energy to its customers.\nWholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\nPSCo conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy related products. PSCo uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price risk and hedge sales and purchases. PSCo also engages in trading activity unrelated to these hedging activities.\nSharing of any margin is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement.\nSPS\nSummary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\nRecovery Mechanisms\nPending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings\n2022 New Mexico Electric Rate Case - In 2022, SPS filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a revised revenue increase of $75 million. The request was based on a ROE of 10.75%, an equity ratio of 54.7%, a future test year ending June 30, 2024 and rate base of $2.4 billion.\nIn October 2023, the NMPRC approved a settlement between SPS, NMPRC Staff, and various parties, which included the following terms:\n\u2022Base rate revenue increase of $33 million, based on the filed future test year.\n\u2022ROE of 9.5%.\n\u2022Equity ratio of 54.7%.\n\u2022The reflection in rates of the retirement of Tolk Generation Station from 2034 to 2028.\nRates went into effect in October 2023.\n2023 Texas Electric Rate Case - In 2023, SPS filed a Texas electric rate case seeking an increase in base rate revenue of $158 million (14%). The request was based on a ROE of 10.65%, an equity ratio of 54.6% and rate base of $3.6 billion. SPS requested a surcharge from July 13, 2023 through the effective date of new base rates.\nIn December 2023, SPS, PUCT Staff and intervenors filed a black box settlement. Key terms include:\n\u2022A base rate increase of $65 million effective back to July 13, 2023.\n\u2022A 9.55% ROE, a 54.51% equity ratio and a 7.11% WACC for purposes of calculating SPS\u2019 allowance for funds used during construction.\n\u2022The reflection in rates of the retirement of Tolk Generation Station from 2034 to 2028.\nA PUCT decision is expected in the first half of 2024.\nSPS and LP&L Termination - SPS and LP&L were parties to a 25-year, 170 MW partial requirements contract serving LP&L. In May 2021, SPS and LP&L finalized a settlement which terminated the contract upon LP&L\u2019s move from the SPP to the ERCOT. Based on the approved de-escalation clause, LP&L paid SPS $66 million in January 2024 to the benefit of SPS\u2019 remaining customers.\n2022 All-Source RFP - In July 2023, SPS filed for approval of CCN for a recommended generation portfolio, which includes 418 MW of self-build solar projects and a 36 MW battery. A decision from PUCT and NMPRC is expected in mid-2024.\nThe second portion of the portfolio includes a November 2023 filing for the approval of PPAs including 48 MW of battery energy storage and 230 MW of existing gas generation. Regulatory decisions on these PPA agreements are expected in Q3 2024.\nNew Mexico Resource Plan - In October 2023, SPS filed its IRP with the NMPRC, which supports projected load growth and secures replacement energy and capacity for retiring resources. Based on load forecast scenarios, SPS\u2019 initial IRP modeling projects a total resource need ranging from approximately 5,300 MW to 10,200 MW by 2030. Upon acceptance of the IRP, SPS expects to issue an RFP for new generation in mid-2024. The RFP will be evaluated in the latter half of 2024 with portfolio selection expected in early 2025.\nPurchased Power Arrangements and Transmission Service Providers\nSPS expects to use electric generating stations, power purchases, DSM and new generation options to meet its system capacity requirements.\nPurchased Power - SPS purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term purchased power contracts typically require periodic capacity and energy charges. SPS also makes short-term purchases to meet system load and energy requirements to replace owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\nPurchased Transmission Services - SPS has contractual arrangements with SPP and regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to its native load customers.\nNatural Gas\nSPS does not provide retail natural gas service, but purchases and transports natural gas for its generation facilities and operates limited natural gas pipeline facilities connecting the generation facilities to interstate natural gas pipelines. SPS is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to natural gas transactions in interstate commerce and the PHMSA, DOT and PUCT for pipeline safety compliance.\nWholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\nSPS conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy related products. SPS uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price risk and to hedge sales and purchases. Sharing of any margin is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement.\nOther\nSupply Chain\nXcel Energy\u2019s ability to meet customer energy requirements, respond to storm-related disruptions, and execute our capital expenditure program are dependent on maintaining an efficient supply chain. Manufacturing processes have experienced disruptions related to the scarcity of certain raw materials and interruptions in production and shipping. Inflationary pressures, labor shortages, and the impact of geopolitical events have further exacerbated these disruptions. Xcel Energy continues to monitor the situation as it remains fluid and seeks to mitigate the impacts by securing alternative suppliers, modifying design standards, and adjusting the timing of work.\nAdditionally, certain products, components, and equipment, particularly in renewables categories, originate in countries that could face tariffs, fines, or restrictions from government or other regulatory bodies and present a cost and supply risk until there is sufficient capacity and supply base with adequate capacity to meet US needs.\nElectric Meters and Transformers\nSupply chain issues associated with semiconductors delayed the availability of AMI meters, which led to a reduced number of meters deployed in 2022. Xcel Energy saw significant improvement in meter availability in 2023 and we expect normal conditions in 2024 and going forward. Xcel Energy expects to complete AMI meter deployment in 2025.\nAdditionally, the availability of certain transformers is an industry-wide issue that has significantly impacted and in some cases resulted in delays to projects and new customer connections. Proposed governmental actions related to transformer efficiency standards may compound these delays in the future. Xcel Energy continues to seek alternative suppliers and prioritize work plans to mitigate the impacts of supply constraints.\nSolar Resources\nIn August 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce completed its anti-circumvention investigation. It concluded that CSPV solar panels and cells imported from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia would be subject to incremental tariffs ranging from 50% to 250%. These countries account for more than 80% of CSPV panel imports.\nAn interim stay on tariffs remains in effect until June 2024. Many significant solar projects have resumed with modified costs and projected in-service dates, including the Sherco Solar facility in Minnesota and certain PPAs in PSCo. Further policy action, a change in the interim stay of tariffs, or other restrictions on solar imports (e.g., due to implementation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act) or disruptions in solar imports from key suppliers could impact project timelines and costs.\nNew Technology and Government Grants\nHydrogen Hub Grant\nIn October 2023, the DOE selected the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, including multiple clean hydrogen projects from Xcel Energy, for award negotiations to receive up to $925 million. The Heartland Hydrogen Hub is one of seven selected to receive DOE funding. The hub includes Xcel Energy, Marathon Petroleum Corporation and TC Energy, in collaboration with the University of North Dakota\u2019s Energy & Environmental Resource Center, to produce and use low-carbon hydrogen at commercial scale in Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The hub aims to reduce carbon emissions by more than 1 million metric tons per year. Xcel Energy expects to receive a large portion of the federal award for its projects within the hub, subject to negotiations. In its application, Xcel Energy proposed investing up to $2 billion over a decade for clean hydrogen producing equipment and infrastructure, representing 75% of full program costs for the company\u2019s portion of the hub. Project detailed design will begin after the Heartland Hydrogen Hub finishes award negotiations. Project development will likely continue through 2035.\nForm Energy Long Duration Storage Grant\nIn September 2023, the DOE awarded Xcel Energy a $70 million grant to support our two 10 MW, 100-hour battery pilots with Form Energy. Xcel Energy expects to develop a 10 MW 100-hour-battery storage unit at the Sherco retiring coal plant site in Minnesota and the Comanche retiring coal plant site in Colorado. Combined with grants from Breakthrough Energy\u2019s Catalyst Fund, Xcel Energy has secured $90 million to support these pilots, which will reduce the costs of the projects for our customers. Long duration energy storage systems are critical to achieve 100% carbon free generation and strengthen the grid from the variability of renewable energy.\nWildfire/Extreme Weather Grant\nIn October 2023, the DOE awarded Xcel Energy $100 million to support projects to mitigate the threat of wildfires and ensure resiliency of the grid through extreme weather. Xcel Energy plans to match the grant with $140 million of investment. The projects will take a number of steps to boost grid resiliency, including adding fire-resistant coatings to 6,000 wood poles, improving equipment safety features in power lines and electric vehicle chargers in high fire risk conditions, moving high-risk distribution circuits underground, and enhancing vegetation management. They will also build on current programs using emerging technology, such as drones aided by artificial intelligence that inspect power lines for safety, wind strength testing, satellite identification of trees that pose a risk and modeling software to predict how fires would spread.\nJoint Targeted Interconnection Queue (JTIQ) Grant\nIn October 2023, the DOE awarded a $464 million grant to Xcel Energy and several other utilities for five JTIQ projects. The projects are part of a collaboration between MISO and SPP that will help to fund the construction of high-voltage transmission lines that improve reliability and resolve constraints in the transmission system for up to 30 gigawatts of new generation. Xcel Energy is part of two of these project awards.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. Application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements, based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and results reported.\nAccounting policies and estimates that are most significant to Xcel Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, and require management\u2019s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are outlined below. Each of these has a higher likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.\nRegulatory Accounting\nXcel Energy is subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations, which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. Our rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows.\nRegulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. In other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally be charged to net income or other comprehensive income.\nEach reporting period we assess the probability of future recoveries and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. Factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders and historical precedents are considered. Decisions made by regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as the rate of return on invested capital, and may materially impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, Xcel Energy had regulatory assets of $3.4 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively and regulatory liabilities of $6.4 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs in any such jurisdiction is no longer probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or other comprehensive income.\nAt Dec. 31, 2023, in assessing the probability of recovery of recognized regulatory assets, unless otherwise disclosed, Xcel Energy noted no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the recovery of the assets.\nSee Notes 4 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIncome Tax Accruals\nJudgment, uncertainty and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of the ETR.\nChanges in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future ETR. ETR calculations are revised every quarter based on best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. Tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.\nIn accordance with the interim period reporting guidance, income tax expense for the first three quarters in a year is based on the forecasted annual ETR. The forecasted ETR reflects a number of estimates, including forecasted annual income, permanent tax adjustments and tax credits.\nValuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that at least a portion may not be realized. Accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized.\nWe may adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accruals as disputes with the IRS and state tax authorities are resolved, and as new developments occur. These adjustments may increase or decrease earnings.\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nEmployee Benefits\nWe sponsor several noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans that cover almost all employees and certain retirees. Projected benefit costs are based on historical information and actuarial calculations that include key assumptions (annual return level on pension and postretirement health care investment assets, discount rates, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates, etc.). In addition, the pension cost calculation uses a methodology to reduce the volatility of investment performance over time. Pension assumptions are continually reviewed.\nAt Dec. 31, 2023, Xcel Energy set the rate of return on assets used to measure pension costs at 6.93%, which is unchanged from the rate set at Dec. 31, 2022. The rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs is 5.00% at Dec. 31, 2023, which is unchanged from the rate set in 2022. Xcel Energy\u2019s pension investment strategy includes plan-specific investments that seek to align the investment allocations to optimize risk adjusted return and interest rate risk management based on factors that include the plan\u2019s funded status. This strategy generally results in a greater percentage of interest rate sensitive securities being allocated to plans with higher funded status ratios and a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having lower funded status ratios.\nXcel Energy set the discount rates used to value the pension obligations and postretirement health care obligations at 5.49% and 5.54% at Dec. 31, 2023, respectively. This represents a 31 basis point and 26 basis point decrease, respectively, from 2022. Xcel Energy uses a bond matching study as its primary basis for determining the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement health care obligations. The bond matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (Aa or higher) bonds that matches the expected cash flows of Xcel Energy\u2019s benefit plans in amount and duration.\nThe effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the discount rate for the individual plans. The bond matching study is validated for reasonableness against the Bank of America US Corporate 15+ Bond Index. In addition, Xcel Energy reviews general actuarial survey data to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.\nIf Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions, a 1% change would result in the following impact on 2023 pension costs:\n(a)These costs include the effects of regulation.\nMortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for pension plan and postretirement benefits. Xcel Energy\u2019s actuary conducts an experience study periodically to determine an estimate of mortality. Xcel Energy considers standard mortality tables, improvement factors and the plans actual experience when selecting a best estimate.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, the initial medical trend cost claim assumptions for Pre-65 was 6.5% and Post-65 was 5.5%. The ultimate trend assumption remained at 4.5% for both Pre-65 and Post-65 claims costs. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care market, considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost experienced by Xcel Energy\u2019s retiree medical plan.\nFunding contributions in 2023 were $50 million and will remain relatively consistent in future years, with the exception of 2024, when Xcel Energy plans on making a higher contributions as a result of the Voluntary Retirement Program offering in 2023. Investment returns were more than the assumed levels in 2023 and 2021, but were less than the assumed levels in 2022.\nThe pension cost calculation uses a market-related valuation of pension assets. Xcel Energy uses a calculated value method to determine the market-related value of the plan assets. The market-related value is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the actual investment return and the expected investment return on the market-related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20% per year.\nAs differences between actual and expected investment returns are incorporated into the market-related value, amounts are recognized in pension cost over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees (approximately 13 years in 2023).\nXcel Energy currently projects the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes will be $59 million in 2024 and $61 million in 2025, while the actual pension costs were $74 million in 2023 and $114 in 2022. The expected decrease in 2024 is primarily due to reductions in the effects or regulations.\nPension funding contributions across all four of Xcel Energy\u2019s pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 2021 - 2024:\n\u2022$100 million in January 2024.\n\u2022$50 million in 2023.\n\u2022$50 million in 2022.\n\u2022$131 million in 2021.\nFuture amounts may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. Therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future. Xcel Energy contributed $11 million, $13 million and $15 million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans. Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $11 million during 2024. Xcel Energy recovers employee benefits costs in its utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below.\n\u2022NSP-Minnesota recognizes pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions using the aggregate normal cost actuarial method. Differences between aggregate normal cost and expense as calculated by pension accounting standards are deferred as a regulatory liability.\n\u2022In 2021, the PSCW approved NSP-Wisconsin\u2019s request for deferred accounting treatment of the 2021 pension settlement accounting expense. Escrow accounting treatment was also approved for ongoing pension and other post-employment benefit expenses, including settlement charges.\n\u2022Regulatory Commissions in Texas, New Mexico and FERC jurisdictions allow the recovery of other postretirement benefit costs only to the extent that recognized expense is matched by cash contributions to an irrevocable trust. Xcel Energy has consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions.\n\u2022PSCo is required to create a regulatory liability that adjusts the annual post-retirement benefits amount to zero in order to match the amount collected in rates.\n\u2022PSCo and SPS recognize pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions based on GAAP. The Texas and Colorado electric retail jurisdictions and the Colorado gas retail jurisdiction, each record the difference between annual recognized pension expense and the annual amount of pension expense approved in their last respective general rate case as a deferral to a regulatory asset.\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nNuclear Decommissioning\nXcel Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, Xcel Energy estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. When Xcel Energy revises any assumptions, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and related long-lived asset. ARO liabilities are accreted to reflect the passage of time using the interest method.\nA significant portion of Xcel Energy\u2019s AROs relates to the future decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota\u2019s nuclear facilities. The nuclear decommissioning obligation is funded by the external decommissioning trust fund. Difference between regulatory funding (including depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized is deferred as a regulatory asset. The amounts recorded for AROs related to future nuclear decommissioning were $2.1 billion in 2023 and $2.2 billion in 2022.\nNSP-Minnesota obtains periodic independent cost studies to estimate the cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities. Estimates of future cash flows are highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. NSP-Minnesota is required to file a nuclear decommissioning filing every three years. The filing covers all expenses for the decommissioning of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material.\nThe 2022 - 2024 Nuclear Decommissioning Study and Assumptions were approved by the MPUC in August 2022. The MPUC ordered the next triennial decommissioning study be filed by December 1, 2024, allowing for four years between filings.\nThe following assumptions have a significant effect on the estimated nuclear obligation:\nTiming - Decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility\u2019s retirement date and timing of the actual decommissioning activities. Estimated retirement dates coincide with the approved retirement dates which can be different than the expiration dates of each unit\u2019s operating license with the NRC (i.e., 2030 for Monticello and 2033 and 2034 for PI\u2019s Unit 1 and 2, respectively).\nIn April 2022, the Company received approval from the MPUC, in the Integrated Resource Plan, to pursue extending the operating life of the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant by ten years from 2030 to 2040. This life extension is subject to NRC approval of Monticello\u2019s nuclear license extension request.\nThe retirement dates of the Prairie Island Unit 1 and Unit 2 remain unchanged, 2033 and 2034 respectively. The estimated timing of the decommissioning activities is based upon the DECON method, which assumes prompt removal and dismantlement. Decommissioning activities are expected to begin at the commission approved retirement date and be completed for both facilities by 2101.\nTechnology and Regulation - There is limited experience with actual decommissioning of large nuclear facilities. Changes in technology, experience and regulations could cause cost estimates to change significantly.\nEscalation Rates - Escalation rates represent projected cost increases due to general inflation and increases in the cost of decommissioning activities. NSP-Minnesota used an escalation rate of 3.2% in calculating the ARO for nuclear decommissioning of its nuclear facilities, based on weighted averages of labor and non-labor escalation factors calculated by Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\nDiscount Rates - Changes in timing or estimated cash flows that result in upward revisions to the ARO are calculated using the then-current credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. The credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect when the change occurs is used to discount the revised estimate of the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity.\nIf the change in timing or estimated expected cash flows results in a downward revision of the ARO, the undiscounted revised estimate of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the date of initial measurement and recognition of the original ARO. Discount rates ranging from approximately 3% to 7% have been used to calculate the net present value of the expected future cash flows over time.\nSignificant uncertainties exist in estimating future costs including the method to be utilized, ultimate costs to decommission and planned method of disposing spent fuel. If different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the AROs could change materially.\nHowever, changes in estimates have minimal impact on results of operations as NSP-Minnesota expects to continue to recover all costs in future rates.\nNSP-Minnesota continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the assumptions and uncertainties for each area. The information and assumptions of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time.\nThis may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements reflect management\u2019s best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2023.\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nLoss Contingencies - Marshall Fire\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against Xcel Energy related to the Marshall Fire are subject to uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued if it is probable of being incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Each reporting period we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. The process for evaluating any wildfire-related liabilities requires a series of complex judgments about past and future events. Factors such as the cause of the wildfire, the extent and magnitude of potential damages, and the status of investigations and legal proceedings are considered. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDerivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks in the normal course of business. Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of adverse changes in the market or fair value for a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk.\nXcel Energy is exposed to the impact of adverse changes in price for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. In addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its derivatives and other contracts, including parental guarantees and requests of collateral. While we expect that the counterparties will perform on the contracts underlying our derivatives, the contracts expose us to credit and non-performance risk.\nDistress in the financial markets may impact counterparty risk and the fair value of the securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and pension fund.\nCommodity Price Risk - We are exposed to commodity price risk in our electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by entering into long and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy-related products and fuels used in generation and distribution activities.\nCommodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our risk management policy allows us to manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation per commission approved hedge plans.\nWholesale and Commodity Trading Risk - Xcel Energy conducts various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. Our risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by our risk management committee.\nFair value of net commodity trading contracts as of Dec. 31, 2023:\n(a)Prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices.\n(b)Prices based on models and other valuation methods.\nChanges in the fair value of commodity trading contracts before the impacts of margin-sharing for the years ended Dec. 31:\nA 10% increase and 10% decrease in forward market prices for Xcel Energy\u2019s commodity trading contracts would have likewise increased and decreased pretax income from continuing operations, by approximately $4 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and $8 million at Dec. 31, 2022. Market price movements can exceed 10% under abnormal circumstances.\nXcel Energy\u2019s\u2019 commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on contracts and obligations using an industry standard methodology known as VaR. VaR expresses the potential change in fair value of the outstanding contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions.\nThe VaRs for the NSP-Minnesota and PSCo commodity trading operations, excluding both non-derivative transactions and derivative transactions designated as normal purchases and normal sales, calculated on a consolidated basis using a Monte Carlo simulation with a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, were as follows:\nNuclear Fuel Supply - NSP-Minnesota has contracted for its 2024 through 2027 enriched nuclear material requirements, which are in various stages of processing in Canada, Europe and the United States. NSP-Minnesota is scheduled to take delivery of approximately 29% of its average enriched nuclear material requirements from Russia through 2030. Given the evolving situation in Ukraine and its global impacts, we have entered into additional new contracts that cover potential supply interruptions of nuclear material from Russia.\nInterest Rate Risk - Xcel Energy is subject to interest rate risk. Our risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives.\nA 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energy\u2019s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by approximately $9 million and $8 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNSP-Minnesota maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the NRC. The nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate and equity price risk. The fund is invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equity securities and other investments. These investments may be used only for the purpose of decommissioning NSP-Minnesota\u2019s nuclear generating plants.\nFluctuations in equity prices or interest rates affecting the nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings due to the application of regulatory accounting. Realized and unrealized gains on the decommissioning fund investments are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota\u2019s regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs.\nThe value of pension and postretirement plan assets and benefit costs are impacted by changes in discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Xcel Energy\u2019s ongoing pension and postretirement investment strategy is based on plan-specific investment recommendations that seek to optimize potential investment risk and minimize interest rate risk associated with changes in the obligations as a plan\u2019s funded status increases over time. The impacts of fluctuations in interest rates on pension and postretirement costs are mitigated by pension cost calculation methodologies and regulatory mechanisms that minimize the earnings impacts of such changes.\nCredit Risk - Xcel Energy is also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties\u2019 nonperformance on their contractual obligations. Xcel Energy maintains credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitors these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations.\nAt Dec. 31, 2023, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $27 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in a decrease in credit exposure of $24 million. At Dec. 31, 2022, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $56 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in an decrease in credit exposure of $47 million.\nXcel Energy conducts credit reviews for all wholesale, trading and non-trading commodity counterparties and employs credit risk controls, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, master netting agreements and termination provisions.\nCredit exposure is monitored, and when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. Distress in the financial markets could increase our credit risk.\nFair Value Measurements\nDerivative contracts, with the exception of those designated as normal purchases and normal sales, are reported at fair value. Xcel Energy\u2019s investments held in the nuclear decommissioning fund, rabbi trusts, pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $1,395 million for 2023 as compared to 2022. The increase was largely due to continued collections of prior year deferred net natural gas, fuel and purchased energy costs, as well as the impact of decreased natural gas prices on accounts payable and receivables.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $1,273 million for 2023 as compared to 2022. The increase in capital expenditures was largely due to continued system expansion.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $49 million for 2023 as compared to 2022. The decrease was largely related to the amount/timing of debt issuances and repayments.\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nCapital Requirements\nXcel Energy has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future. Xcel Energy expects to have adequate amounts of cash from operating and financing activities to meet both its short-term and long-term cash requirements. Xcel Energy\u2019s financing requirements are dependent on both existing contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as projected capital forecasts. Xcel Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short-term debt, long-term debt, common stock, hybrid and other securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Projected future financing requirements can be impacted by various factors including constraints to supply chain and labor, regulatory lag and inflation.\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Other Commitments\n(a)Included in operating lease obligations are $244 million, $461 million, $269 million and $259 million, for the less than 1 year, 1 - 3 years, 3 - 5 years and after 5 years categories, respectively, pertaining to PPAs that were accounted for as operating leases.\n(b)Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its fuel (nuclear, natural gas and coal) requirements. Additionally, the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy Inc. have entered into non-lease purchase power agreements. Certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted on indices. Effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment mechanisms.\n(c)Amounts exclude approximately $1 billion of minimum payments related to SPS\u2019 extension of a non-lease PPA that otherwise expires in 2026, pending PUCT and NMPRC approvals to extend the agreement to 2039. Approval processes are expected to conclude in 2024.\n(d)Primarily consists of contracts for information technology services.\nCapital Expenditures - Base capital expenditures and incremental capital forecasts:\n(a)Other category includes intercompany transfers for safe harbor wind turbines.\nThe base plan does not include potential renewable generation additions at the NSP System, SPS and PSCo, which could result in additional capital expenditures of approximately $5 billion. Xcel Energy generally expects to fund additional capital investment with approximately 40% equity and 60% debt.\nXcel Energy\u2019s capital expenditure forecast is subject to continuing review and modification. Actual capital expenditures may vary from estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, safety and reliability needs, regulatory decisions, legislative initiatives (e.g., federal clean energy and tax policy), reserve requirements, availability of purchased power, alternative plans for meeting long-term energy needs, environmental initiatives and regulation, and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities.\nFinancing for Capital Expenditures through 2028 - Xcel Energy issues debt and equity securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt, fund capital programs, infuse equity in subsidiaries, fund asset acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.\nCurrent estimated financing plans of Xcel Energy for 2024 through 2028 (includes the impact of tax credit transferability):\n(a)Net of dividends and pension funding.\n(b)Reflects a combination of short and long-term debt; net of refinancing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nXcel Energy does not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, other than those currently disclosed, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCommon Stock Dividends - Future dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reinvestment opportunities and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel Energy Inc. Board of Directors. In February 2024, Xcel Energy announced an increase in the annual dividend of 11 cents per share, which represents an increase of 5.3%.\nXcel Energy\u2019s dividend policy balances the following:\n\u2022Projected cash generation.\n\u2022Projected capital investment.\n\u2022A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment.\n\u2022The impact on Xcel Energy\u2019s capital structure and credit ratings.\nIn addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels. Federal law places limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding company to declare dividends. Under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The utility subsidiaries\u2019 dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture covenants.\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nPension Fund - Xcel Energy\u2019s pension assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity securities, short-term to long-duration fixed income securities and alternative investments, including private equity, real estate and hedge funds.\nFunded status and pension assumptions:\n(a)Excludes non-qualified plan of $12 million and $11 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCapital Sources\nShort-Term Funding Sources - Xcel Energy generally funds short-term needs, through operating cash flows, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing of short-term funding needs depend on construction expenditures, working capital and dividend payments.\nShort-Term Investments - Xcel Energy Inc., NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS maintain cash and short-term investment accounts.\nShort-Term Debt - Xcel Energy Inc., NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS each have individual commercial paper programs. Authorized levels for these commercial paper programs are:\n\u2022$1.50 billion for Xcel Energy Inc.\n\u2022$700 million for PSCo.\n\u2022$700 million for NSP-Minnesota.\n\u2022$500 million for SPS.\n\u2022$150 million for NSP-Wisconsin.\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nCredit Facility Agreements - Xcel Energy Inc., NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS each have the right to request an extension of the revolving credit facility for two additional one-year periods. NSP-Wisconsin has the right to request an extension of the revolving credit facility for an additional year. All extension requests are subject to majority bank group approval.\nAs of Feb. 20, 2024, Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit facilities available to meet liquidity needs:\n(a)Credit facilities expire in September 2027.\n(b)Includes outstanding commercial paper and letters of credit.\nRegistration Statements - Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of one billion shares of $2.50 par value common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, Xcel Energy had approximately 555 million shares and 550 million shares of common stock outstanding, respectively.\nXcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries have registration statements on file with the SEC which are uncapped, permitting Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries to issue debt, equity and other securities. Debt issuance at our utility subsidiaries are subject to commission approval.\nPlanned Financing Activity - Xcel Energy\u2019s 2024 financing plans reflect the following:\nLong-Term Borrowings, Equity Issuances and Other Financing Instruments - Xcel Energy may issue equity through its at-the-market program or other offerings. Financing plans are subject to change, depending on capital expenditures, regulatory outcomes, internal cash generation, market conditions, changes in tax policies and other factors.\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nEarnings Guidance and Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives\nXcel Energy 2024 Earnings Guidance - Xcel Energy\u2019s 2024 ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share.(a)\nKey assumptions as compared with 2023 actual levels unless noted:\n\u2022Constructive outcomes in all pending rate case and regulatory proceedings.\n\u2022Normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year.\n\u2022Weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase 2% to 3%.\n\u2022Weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to be flat.\n\u2022Capital rider revenue is projected to increase $70 million to $80 million (net of PTCs).\n\u2022O&M expenses are projected to increase 1% to 2%.\n\u2022Depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $250 million to $260 million.\n\u2022Property taxes are projected to increase $50 million to $60 million.\n\u2022Interest expense (net of AFUDC - debt) is projected to increase $130 million to $140 million, net of interest income.\n\u2022AFUDC - equity is projected to increase $45 million to $55 million.\n\u2022ETR is projected to be ~(4%) to (6%). The negative ETR is largely offset by PTCs flowing back to customers in the capital riders and fuel mechanisms and is largely earnings neutral. The projected ETR does not reflect the potential impact of nuclear PTCs, which are also expected to flow back to customers.\n(a)Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management\u2019s view, not reflective of ongoing operations. Ongoing earnings could differ from those prepared in accordance with GAAP for unplanned and/or unknown adjustments. As Xcel Energy is unable to quantify the financial impacts of any additional adjustments that may occur for the year, we are unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing EPS to corresponding GAAP EPS.\nLong-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives - Xcel Energy expects to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, based on the following long-term objectives:\n\u2022 Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of 5% to 7% based off of a 2023 actual ongoing earnings base of $3.35 per share.\n\u2022 Deliver annual dividend increases of 5% to 7%.\n\u2022 Target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60%.\n\u2022 Maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range.",

    "item_8": "ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nSee Item 15 - 1 for an index of financial statements included herein.\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Xcel Energy Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nXcel Energy Inc. management assessed the effectiveness of Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of Dec. 31, 2023, Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria.\nXcel Energy Inc.\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Its report appears herein.\n/s/ ROBERT C. FRENZEL /s/ BRIAN J. VAN ABEL\nRobert C. Frenzel Brian J. Van Abel\nChairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nFeb. 21, 2024 Feb. 21, 2024\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Xcel Energy Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 4 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce, (collectively with state utility regulatory agencies, the \u201cCommissions\u201d). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including property, plant and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and expenses, and income taxes.\nThe Company is subject to regulatory rate setting processes. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company\u2019s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company\u2019s investment in assets required to deliver services to customers. Accounting for the Company\u2019s regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. The Commissions\u2019 regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. In the rate setting process, the Company\u2019s rates result in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds due to customers. Given that management\u2019s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the recognition of regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n\u2022We evaluated the Company\u2019s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\u2022We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company, other regulatory filings, legal decisions and recommendations being evaluated by the Commissions, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. We evaluated historic orders for precedents of the Commissions\u2019 treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We compared the regulatory orders, filings and other publicly available information to the Company\u2019s recorded regulatory assets and liabilities for completeness.\n\u2022We obtained management\u2019s analysis and correspondence from counsel, as appropriate, regarding regulatory assets or liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management\u2019s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nFebruary 21, 2024\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nXCEL ENERGY INC.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nGeneral - Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s utility subsidiaries are engaged in the regulated generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the regulated purchase, transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas.\nXcel Energy\u2019s regulated operations include the activities of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These utility subsidiaries serve electric and natural gas customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Also included in regulated operations are WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, and WYCO, a joint venture with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities.\nXcel Energy Inc.\u2019s nonregulated subsidiaries include:\nXcel Energy Inc. owns the following additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate holding companies with additional subsidiaries:\nXcel Energy and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.\nXcel Energy\u2019s consolidated financial statements include its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated unless a different treatment is appropriate for rate regulated transactions. The equity method of accounting is used for its investments in EIP funds and WYCO.\nInvestments in certain plants and transmission facilities are jointly owned with nonaffiliated utilities. A proportionate share of jointly owned facilities is recorded as property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets, and Xcel Energy\u2019s share of operating costs associated with these facilities is included in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP. All of the utility subsidiaries\u2019 underlying accounting records also conform to the FERC uniform system of accounts.\nCertain amounts in the consolidated financial statements or notes have been reclassified for comparative purposes; however, such reclassifications did not affect net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows.\nXcel Energy has evaluated events occurring after Dec. 31, 2023 up to the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. These statements contain all necessary adjustments and disclosures resulting from that evaluation.\nUse of Estimates - Xcel Energy uses estimates based on the best information available to record transactions and balances resulting from business operations.\nEstimates are used for items such as plant depreciable lives or potential disallowances, AROs, certain regulatory assets and liabilities, tax provisions, uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues, jurisdictional fuel and energy cost allocations and actuarially determined benefit costs. Recorded estimates are revised when better information becomes available or actual amounts can be determined. Revisions can affect operating results.\nRegulatory Accounting - The regulated utility subsidiaries account for income and expense items in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated operations. Under this guidance:\n\u2022Certain costs, which would otherwise be charged to expense or other comprehensive income, are deferred as regulatory assets based on the expected ability to recover the costs in future rates.\n\u2022Certain credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income or other comprehensive income, are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on the expectation the amounts will be returned to customers in future rates, or because the amounts were collected in rates prior to the costs being incurred.\nEstimates and assumptions for recovery of deferred costs and refund of deferred credits are based on specific ratemaking decisions, precedent or other available information. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment in the rate setting process.\nIf changes in the regulatory environment occur, the utility subsidiaries may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate regulatory assets and liabilities. Such changes could have a material effect on Xcel Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSee Note 4 for further information.\nIncome Taxes - Xcel Energy accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are deferred for all temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable income and between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities utilizing rates that are scheduled to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.\nUtility rate regulation has resulted in the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities related to income taxes. The effects of tax rate changes that are attributable to the utility subsidiaries are generally subject to a normalization method of accounting. Therefore, the revaluation of most of the utility subsidiaries\u2019 net deferred taxes upon a tax rate reduction results in the establishment of a net regulatory liability, refundable to utility customers over the remaining life of the related assets.\nXcel Energy anticipates that a tax rate increase would predominantly result in the establishment of a regulatory asset, subject to an evaluation of whether future recovery is expected.\nReversal of certain temporary differences are accounted for as current income tax expense due to the effects of past regulatory practices when deferred taxes were not required to be recorded due to the use of flow through accounting for ratemaking purposes.\nTax credits are recorded when earned unless there is a requirement to defer the benefit and amortize over the book depreciable lives of related property. The requirement to defer and amortize these credits specifically applies to certain federal ITCs, as determined by tax regulations and Xcel Energy tax elections. For tax credits otherwise eligible to be recognized when earned, Xcel Energy considers the impact of rate regulation to determine if these credits and related adjustments should be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This evaluation includes consideration of whether tax credits are expected to be sold at a discount and impact the realization of amounts presented as deferred tax assets. Transferable tax credits are accounted for under ASC 740 Income Taxes, and valuation allowances and any adjustments for discounts incurred on sales transactions are recorded to deferred tax expense, typically recovered in the utility subsidiaries\u2019 regulatory mechanisms.\nXcel Energy measures and discloses uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns. A tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. Recognition of changes in uncertain tax positions are reflected as a component of income tax expense.\nInterest and penalties related to income taxes are reported within Other income (expense), net or interest charges in the consolidated statements of income.\nXcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns as well as consolidated or separate state income tax returns. Federal income taxes paid by Xcel Energy Inc. are allocated to its subsidiaries based on separate company computations. A similar allocation is made for state income taxes paid by Xcel Energy Inc. in connection with consolidated state filings. Xcel Energy Inc. also allocates its own income tax benefits to its direct subsidiaries.\nSee Note 7 for further information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation in Regulated Operations - Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost. The cost of plant includes direct labor and materials, contracted work, overhead costs and AFUDC. The cost of plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation and amortization. Amounts recovered in rates for future removal costs are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs and replacement of items determined to be less than a unit of property are charged to expense as incurred.\nProperty, plant and equipment is tested for impairment when it is determined that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. A loss is recognized in the current period if it becomes probable that part of a cost of a plant under construction or recently completed plant will be disallowed for recovery from customers and a reasonable estimate of the disallowance can be made. For investments in property, plant and equipment that are abandoned and not expected to go into service, incurred costs and related deferred tax amounts are compared to the discounted estimated future rate recovery, and a loss is recognized, if necessary.\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the plant\u2019s commission approved useful life. Actuarial life studies are performed and submitted to the state and federal commissions for review. Upon acceptance by the various commissions, the resulting lives and net salvage rates are used to calculate depreciation. Plant removal costs are typically recognized at the amounts recovered in rates as authorized by the applicable regulator. Accumulated removal costs are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as a regulatory liability. Depreciation expense, expressed as a percentage of average depreciable property, was approximately 3.6% for 2023, 3.7% for 2022 and 3.5% for 2021.\nSee Note 3 for further information.\nAROs - Xcel Energy records AROs as a liability in the period incurred (if fair value can be reasonably estimated), with the offsetting/associated costs capitalized as a long-lived asset. The liability is generally increased over time by applying the effective interest method of accretion and the capitalized costs are typically depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset. Changes resulting from revisions to timing or amounts of expected asset retirement cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO.\nSee Note 12 for further information.\nNuclear Decommissioning - Nuclear decommissioning studies that estimate NSP-Minnesota\u2019s costs of decommissioning its nuclear power plants are normally performed at least every three years and submitted to the state commissions for approval. Due to other regulatory activity, the next decommissioning study has been deferred one year until 2024.\nNSP-Minnesota recovers regulator-approved decommissioning costs of its nuclear power plants over each facility\u2019s expected service life, typically based on the triennial decommissioning studies. The studies consider estimated future costs of decommissioning and the market value of investments in trust funds and recommend annual funding amounts. Amounts collected in rates are deposited in the trust funds. For financial reporting purposes, NSP-Minnesota accounts for nuclear decommissioning as an ARO.\nRestricted funds for future decommissioning expenditures for NSP-Minnesota\u2019s nuclear facilities are included in nuclear decommissioning fund and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nSee Notes 10 and 12 for further information.\nBenefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits - Xcel Energy maintains pension and postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees. Recognizing the cost of providing benefits and measuring the projected benefit obligation of these plans requires management to make various assumptions and estimates.\nCertain unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs or credits are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities, rather than recorded as other comprehensive income, based on regulatory recovery mechanisms.\nSee Note 11 for further information.\nEnvironmental Costs - Environmental costs are recorded when it is probable Xcel Energy is liable for remediation costs and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Costs are deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable the costs will be recovered from customers in future rates. Otherwise, the costs are expensed. For certain environmental costs related to facilities currently in use, such as for emission-control equipment, the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the plant.\nEstimated remediation costs are regularly adjusted as estimates are revised and remediation is performed. If other participating potentially responsible parties exist and acknowledge their potential involvement with a site, costs are estimated and recorded only for Xcel Energy\u2019s expected share of the cost.\nEstimated future expenditures to restore sites are treated as a capitalized cost of plant retirement. The depreciation expense levels recoverable in rates include a provision for removal expenses. Removal costs recovered in rates before the related costs are incurred are classified as a regulatory liability.\nSee Note 12 for further information.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers - Performance obligations related to the sale of energy are satisfied as energy is delivered to customers. Xcel Energy recognizes revenue that corresponds to the price of the energy delivered to the customer. The measurement of energy sales to customers is generally based on the reading of their meters, which occurs systematically throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recognized.\nA separate financing component of collections from customers is not recognized as contract terms are short-term in nature. Revenues are net of any excise or sales taxes or fees. The utility subsidiaries recognize physical sales to customers (native load and wholesale) on a gross basis in electric revenues and cost of sales. Revenues and charges for short-term physical wholesale sales of excess energy transacted through RTO/ISOs are also recorded on a gross basis. Other revenues and charges settled/facilitated through an RTO/ISO are recorded on a net basis in cost of sales.\nSee Note 6 for further information.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Xcel Energy considers investments in instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Bad Debts - Accounts receivable are stated at the actual billed amount net of an allowance for bad debts. Xcel Energy establishes an allowance for uncollectible receivables based on a policy that reflects its expected exposure to the credit risk of customers.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for bad debts was $128 million and $122 million, respectively.\nInventory - Inventory is recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value and consisted of the following:\nEquity Method Investments - The equity method of accounting is used for certain investments including WYCO and EIP funds, which requires Xcel Energy\u2019s recognition of its share of these investees\u2019 results, based on Xcel Energy\u2019s proportional ownership interest. For investments in EIP funds, this includes Xcel Energy\u2019s share of fund expenses and realized gains and losses, as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from valuations of the funds\u2019 investments in emerging energy technology companies.\nFair Value Measurements - Xcel Energy presents cash equivalents, interest rate derivatives, rabbi trust assets, commodity derivatives, pension and postretirement plan assets and nuclear decommissioning fund assets at estimated fair values in its consolidated financial statements.\nFor interest rate derivatives, quoted prices based primarily on observable market interest rate curves are used to estimate fair value. For commodity derivatives, the most observable inputs available are generally used to determine the fair value of each contract. In the absence of a quoted price, quoted prices for similar contracts or internally prepared valuation models may be used to determine fair value.\nFor rabbi trust assets, pension and postretirement plan assets and nuclear decommissioning fund assets, published trading data and pricing models, generally using the most observable inputs available, are utilized to determine fair value for each security.\nSee Notes 10 and 11 for further information.\nDerivative Instruments - Xcel Energy uses derivative instruments in connection with its commodity trading activities, and to manage risk associated with changes in interest rates and utility commodity prices, including forward contracts, futures, swaps and options. Derivatives not qualifying for the normal purchases and normal sales exception are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as derivative instruments. Classification of changes in fair value for those derivative instruments is dependent on the designation of a qualifying hedging relationship.\nChanges in fair value of derivative instruments not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are reflected in current earnings or as a regulatory asset or liability. Classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.\nGains or losses on commodity trading transactions are recorded as a component of electric operating revenues.\nNormal Purchases and Normal Sales - Xcel Energy enters into contracts for purchases and sales of commodities for use in its operations. At inception, contracts are evaluated to determine whether they contain a derivative, and if so, whether they may be exempted from derivative accounting if designated as normal purchases or normal sales.\nSee Note 10 for further information.\nCommodity Trading Operations - All applicable gains and losses related to commodity trading activities are shown on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\nCommodity trading activities are not associated with energy produced from generation assets or energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading contracts are recorded at fair market value and commodity trading results include the impact of all margin-sharing mechanisms.\nSee Note 10 for further information.\nOther Utility Items\nAFUDC - AFUDC represents the cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity and is computed by applying a composite financing rate to qualified CWIP. The amount of AFUDC capitalized as a utility construction cost is credited to other nonoperating income (for equity capital) and interest charges (for debt capital). AFUDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel Energy\u2019s rate base.\nAlternative Revenue - Certain rate rider mechanisms (including decoupling/sales true up and CIP/DSM programs) qualify as alternative revenue programs. These mechanisms arise from instances in which the regulator authorizes a future surcharge in response to past activities or completed events. When certain criteria are met, including expected collection within 24 months, revenue is recognized, which may include incentives and return on rate base items.\nBilling amounts are revised periodically for differences between total amount collected and revenue earned, which may increase or decrease the level of revenue collected from customers. Alternative revenues arising from these programs are presented on a gross basis and disclosed separately from revenue from contracts with customers.\nSee Note 6 for further information.\nConservation Programs - Costs incurred for DSM and CIP programs are deferred if it is probable future revenue will recover the incurred cost. Revenues recognized for incentive programs for the recovery of lost margins and/or conservation performance incentives are limited to amounts expected to be collected within 24 months from the year they are earned. Regulatory assets are recognized to reflect the amount of costs or earned incentives that have not yet been collected from customers.\nEmissions Allowances - Emissions allowances are recorded at cost, including broker commission fees. The inventory accounting model is utilized for all emissions allowances and any sales of these allowances are included in electric revenues.\nNuclear Refueling Outage Costs - Xcel Energy uses a deferral and amortization method for nuclear refueling costs. This method amortizes costs over the period between refueling outages consistent with rate recovery.\nRECs - Cost of RECs that are utilized for compliance is recorded as electric fuel and purchased power expense. In certain jurisdictions, Xcel Energy reduces recoverable fuel and purchased power costs for the cost of RECs received.\nAn inventory accounting model is used to account for RECs, however these assets are classified as regulatory assets if amounts are recoverable in future rates.\nSales of RECs are recorded in electric revenues on a gross basis. The cost of these RECs and amounts credited to customers under margin-sharing mechanisms are recorded in electric fuel and purchased power expense.\nCost of RECs that are utilized to support commodity trading activities are recorded in a similar manner as the associated commodities and are presented on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\n2. Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued\nSegment Reporting - In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 - Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which extends the existing requirements for annual disclosures to quarterly periods, and requires that both annual and quarterly disclosures present segment expenses using line items consistent with information regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2023 and quarterly periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2024, and Xcel Energy does not expect implementation of the new disclosure guidance to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes - In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 - Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, with new disclosure requirements including presentation of prescribed line items in the effective tax rate reconciliation and disclosures regarding state and local tax payments. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2024, and Xcel Energy does not expect implementation of the new disclosure guidance to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Property, Plant and Equipment\nMajor classes of property, plant and equipment\n(a)Amounts include Sherco 1 and 3 and A.S. King for NSP-Minnesota; Comanche Units 2 and 3, Craig Units 1 and 2, Hayden Units 1 and 2 and coal generation assets at Pawnee pending facility gas conversion for PSCo; and Tolk Unit 1 and 2 and coal generation assets at Harrington pending facility gas conversion for SPS. The Dec. 31, 2022 balance also includes Sherco 2, which was retired on Dec. 31, 2023. Amounts are presented net of accumulated depreciation.\nJoint Ownership of Generation, Transmission and Gas Facilities\nThe utility subsidiaries\u2019 jointly owned assets as of Dec. 31, 2023:\n(a)Projects additionally include $2 million in CWIP.\n(a)Projects additionally include $1 million in CWIP.\n(a)Projects additionally include $18 million in CWIP.\nEach company\u2019s share of operating expenses and construction expenditures is included in the applicable utility accounts. Respective owners are responsible for providing their own financing.\n4. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nRegulatory assets and liabilities are created for amounts that regulators may allow to be collected or may require to be paid back to customers in future electric and natural gas rates. Xcel Energy would be required to recognize the write-off of regulatory assets and liabilities in net income or other comprehensive income if changes in the utility industry no longer allow for the application of regulatory accounting guidance under GAAP.\nComponents of regulatory assets:\n(a)Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.\n(b)The 2022 amount is net of the nuclear decommissioning accruals and gains from decommissioning investments. In 2023, the nuclear decommissioning accruals and gains from decommissioning investments exceeded the expected cost of AROs in NSP-Minnesota and was reclassified to a regulatory liability.\n(c)Includes costs for conservation programs, as well as incentives allowed in certain jurisdictions.\n(d)Includes the fair value of certain long-term PPAs used to meet energy capacity requirements and valuation adjustments on natural gas commodity purchases.\nComponents of regulatory liabilities:\n(a)Includes the revaluation of recoverable/regulated plant accumulated deferred income taxes and revaluation impact of non-plant accumulated deferred income taxes due to the TCJA.\n(b)Includes regulatory amortization and certain 2018 TCJA benefits approved by the CPUC to offset the PSCo prepaid pension asset.\n(c)Includes amounts recorded for future recovery of AROs, less amounts recovered through nuclear decommissioning accruals and gains from decommissioning investments.\n(d)Includes the fair value of FTR instruments utilized/intended to offset the impacts of transmission system congestion.\n(e)Includes costs for conservation programs, as well as incentives allowed in certain jurisdictions.\n(f)Revenue subject to refund of $187 million and $67 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, is included in other current liabilities.\nXcel Energy\u2019s regulatory assets not earning a return include past expenditures of $1,085 million and $1,020 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, which predominately relate to purchased natural gas and electric energy costs (including certain costs related to Winter Storm Uri), sales true-up and revenue decoupling, various renewable resources/environmental initiatives and certain prepaid pension amounts. Additionally, the unfunded portion of pension and retiree medical obligations and net AROs (i.e. deferrals for which cash has not been disbursed) do not earn a return.\n5. Borrowings and Other Financing Instruments\nShort-Term Borrowings\nShort-Term Debt - Xcel Energy meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under their credit facilities and term loan agreements.\nCommercial paper and other borrowings outstanding:\nBilateral Credit Agreement - In April 2023, NSP-Minnesota\u2019s uncommitted bilateral credit agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term. The credit agreement is limited in use to support letters of credit.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, NSP-Minnesota had $65 million outstanding letters of credit under the $75 million Bilateral Credit Agreement.\nLetters of Credit - Xcel Energy uses letters of credit, typically with terms of one year, to provide financial guarantees for certain operating obligations. As of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, there were $44 million and $43 million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facilities, respectively. Amounts approximate their fair value.\nCredit Facilities - In order to use commercial paper programs to fulfill short-term funding needs, Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries must have revolving credit facilities in place at least equal to the amount of their respective commercial paper borrowing limits and cannot issue commercial paper exceeding available capacity under these credit facilities.\nThe lines of credit provide short-term financing in the form of notes payable to banks, letters of credit and back-up support for commercial paper borrowings.\nTerms of Credit Agreements - In September 2022, Xcel Energy Inc., NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS each entered into an amended five-year credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The aggregate borrowing limit is $3.55 billion. The amended credit agreements mature in September 2027.\nFeatures of the credit facilities:\n(a)Each credit facility has a financial covenant requiring that the debt-to-total capitalization ratio be less than or equal to 65%.\n(b)Amounts authorized by state commissions in respective jurisdictions.\n(c)All extension requests are subject to majority bank group approval.\n(d)The Xcel Energy Inc. credit facility has a cross-default provision that Xcel Energy Inc. would be in default on its borrowings under the facility if it or any of its subsidiaries (except NSP-Wisconsin as long as its total assets do not comprise more than 15% of Xcel Energy\u2019s consolidated total assets) default on indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $75 million.\nIf Xcel Energy Inc. or its utility subsidiaries do not comply with the covenant, an event of default may be declared, and if not remedied, any outstanding amounts due under the facility can be declared due by the lender. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all financial covenants.\nXcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit facilities available as of Dec. 31, 2023:\n(a)These credit facilities mature in September 2027.\n(b)Includes outstanding commercial paper and letters of credit.\nAll credit facility bank borrowings, outstanding letters of credit and outstanding commercial paper reduce the available capacity under the credit facilities. Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries had no direct advances on facilities outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLong-Term Borrowings and Other Financing Instruments\nGenerally, the property of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS is subject to the liens of their respective first mortgage indentures for the benefit of bondholders.\nDebt premiums, discounts and expenses are amortized over the life of the related debt. The premiums, discounts and expenses for refinanced debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the new issuance.\nLong-term debt obligations for Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries as of Dec. 31 (in millions of dollars):\n(a)2022 financing.\n(b)2023 financing.\n(a)2022 financing.\n(b)2023 financing.\n(a)2022 financing.\n(b)2023 financing.\n(a)2022 financing.\n(b)2023 financing.\n(a)2022 financing.\n(b)2023 financing.\nMaturities of long-term debt:\nDeferred Financing Costs - Deferred financing costs of approximately $209 million and $193 million, net of amortization, are presented as a deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEquity through DRIP and Benefits Program - Xcel Energy issued $88 million of equity in 2023 and $84 million of equity in 2022 through the DRIP and benefits programs. The program allows shareholders to reinvest their dividends directly in Xcel Energy Inc. common stock.\nATM Equity Offering - In November 2021, Xcel Energy Inc. filed a prospectus supplement under which it may sell up to $800 million of its common stock through an ATM program. In 2021, 5.33 million shares of common stock were issued (approximately $350 million in net proceeds and $3 million in transaction fees paid). In 2022, 4.30 million shares of common stock were issued (approximately $300 million in net proceeds and $3 million in transaction fees paid). In 2023, 0.90 million shares of common stock were issued ($62 million in net proceeds and $1 million in transaction fees paid). In October 2023, the 2021 ATM offering was closed.\nIn October 2023, Xcel Energy Inc. filed a prospectus supplement under which it may sell up to $2.5 billion of its common stock through an ATM program. In the fourth quarter, through this ATM Program, Xcel Energy Inc. issued 3.12 million shares of common stock ($188 million in net proceeds and $2 million in transaction fees paid).\nCapital Stock - Preferred stock authorized/outstanding:\nXcel Energy Inc. had the following common stock authorized/outstanding:\nDividend and Other Capital-Related Restrictions - Xcel Energy depends on its utility subsidiaries to pay dividends. Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s utility subsidiaries\u2019 dividends are subject to the FERC\u2019s jurisdiction, which prohibits the payment of dividends out of capital accounts. Dividends are solely to be paid from retained earnings. Certain covenants also require Xcel Energy Inc. to be current on interest payments prior to dividend disbursements.\nState regulatory commissions impose dividend limitations for NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and SPS, which are more restrictive than those imposed by the FERC.\nRequirements and actuals as of Dec. 31, 2023:\n(a) Cannot pay annual dividends in excess of forecasted levels if its average equity-to-total capitalization ratio falls below the commission authorized level.\n(b) Excludes short-term debt.\n(a)May not pay a dividend that would cause a loss of its investment grade bond rating.\nIssuance of securities by Xcel Energy Inc. is not generally subject to regulatory approval. However, utility financings and intra-system financings are subject to the jurisdiction of state regulatory commissions and/or the FERC. Xcel Energy may seek additional authorization as necessary.\nAmounts authorized to issue as of Dec. 31, 2023:\n(a)NSP-Minnesota has authorization to issue long-term securities provided the equity-to-total capitalization remains within the required range, and to issue short-term debt provided it does not exceed 15% of total capitalization.\n6. Revenues\nRevenue is classified by the type of goods/services rendered and market/customer type. Xcel Energy\u2019s operating revenues consisted of the following:\n7. Income Taxes\nTotal income tax expense from operations differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income tax expense.\nEffective income tax rate for years ended Dec. 31:\n(a)Wind PTCs net of estimated transfer discount are credited to customers (reduction to revenue) and do not materially impact net income.\n(b)Plant regulatory differences primarily relate to the credit of excess deferred taxes to customers through the average rate assumption method. Income tax benefits associated with the credit are offset by corresponding revenue reductions.\nComponents of income tax expense for years ended Dec. 31:\nComponents of deferred income tax expense as of Dec. 31:\n(a)Proceeds from tax credit transfers are included in cash received (paid) for income taxes in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nComponents of net deferred tax liability as of Dec. 31:\n(a)Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nOther Income Tax Matters - NOL amounts represent the tax loss that is carried forward and tax credits represent the deferred tax asset. NOL and tax credit carryforwards as of Dec. 31:\n(a)State tax credit carryforwards are net of federal detriment of $20 million and $23 million as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(b)Valuation allowances for state tax credit carryforwards were net of federal benefit of $16 million as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFederal carryforward periods expire between 2037 and 2043 and state carryforward periods expire starting 2024.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nFederal Audit - Statute of limitations applicable to Xcel Energy\u2019s consolidated federal income tax returns expire as follows:\nAdditionally, the statute of limitations related to the federal tax credit carryforwards will remain open until those credits are utilized in subsequent returns. Further, the statute of limitations related to the additional federal tax loss carryback claim filed in 2020 has been extended. As of Dec. 31, 2023 the IRS issued its Revenue Agent\u2019s Report related to the federal tax loss carryback claim. The Company materially agrees with the report and re-recognized the related benefit in December 2023.\nState Audits - Xcel Energy files consolidated state tax returns based on income in its major operating jurisdictions and various other state income-based tax returns.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, Xcel Energy\u2019s earliest open tax years (subject to examination by state taxing authorities in its major operating jurisdictions) were as follows:\n\u2022In 2020, Minnesota began an audit of tax years 2015 - 2018. In 2022, the state of Minnesota issued its audit report and in 2023, the Company agreed to the report without any material adjustments.\n\u2022In 2021, Texas began an audit of tax years 2016 - 2019. As of Dec. 31, 2023, no material adjustments have been proposed.\n\u2022In 2021, Wisconsin began an audit of tax years 2016-2019. As of Dec. 31, 2023, no material adjustments have been proposed.\n\u2022No other state income tax audits are in progress for its major operating jurisdictions as of Dec. 31, 2023.\nUnrecognized tax benefit balance includes permanent tax positions, which if recognized would affect the ETR. In addition, the unrecognized tax benefit balance includes temporary tax positions for which deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing. A change in the period of deductibility would not affect the ETR but would accelerate the payment to the taxing authority.\nUnrecognized tax benefits - permanent vs. temporary:\nChanges in unrecognized tax benefits:\nUnrecognized tax benefits were reduced by tax benefits associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards:\nAs IRS audits resume and as state audits progress, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefit could decrease up to approximately $14 million in the next 12 months.\nPayable for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is partially offset by the interest benefit associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards.\nInterest payable related to unrecognized tax benefits:\nNo penalties were accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as of Dec. 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\n8. Share-Based Compensation\nIncentive Plan Including Share-Based Compensation - Xcel Energy has authorized 7.0 million equity shares under an incentive plan (the Amended and Restated 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan).\nEquity Awards - Xcel Energy\u2018s Board of Directors has granted equity awards under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which includes various vesting conditions and performance goals. At the end of the restricted period, such grants will be awarded if vesting conditions and/or performance goals are met.\nCertain employees are granted equity awards with a portion subject only to service conditions, and the other portion subject to performance conditions. The total time-based equity shares granted subject only to service conditions was 0.4 million in 2023 and 0.2 million in 2022 and 2021 respectively.\nThe performance conditions for a portion of the awards granted from 2021 to 2023 are based on relative TSR and environmental goals. Equity awards with performance conditions will be settled after three years, with payouts ranging from zero to 200% depending on achievement.\nEquity award units granted to employees:\nEquity awards vested:\nChanges in the nonvested portion of equity award units:\nStock Equivalent Units - Non-employee members of Xcel Energy\u2018s Board of Directors may elect to receive their annual equity grant as stock equivalent units in lieu of common stock. Each unit\u2019s value is equal to one share of common stock. The annual equity grant is vested as of the date of each member\u2019s election to the Board of Directors; there is no further service or other condition. Directors may also elect to receive their fees as stock equivalent units in lieu of cash. Stock equivalent units are payable as a distribution of common stock upon a director\u2019s termination of service.\nStock equivalent units granted:\nChanges in stock equivalent units:\nLiability Awards - Xcel Energy\u2019s Board of Directors has granted TSR liability awards under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. This plan allows Xcel Energy to attach various performance goals to the awards granted. The liability awards have been historically dependent on relative TSR measured over a three-year period. Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s TSR is compared to a peer group of other utility companies. Potential payouts of the awards range from zero to 200%.\nLiability awards granted:\nLiability awards settled:\nTSR liability awards of $13 million were settled in cash in 2023.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense - Award settlement determination (permitting cash or share settlement) is made by Xcel Energy, not the participants. Equity awards have not been previously settled in cash and Xcel Energy plans to continue electing share settlement. Grant date fair value of equity awards is expensed over the service period.\nTSR liability awards are accounted for as liabilities, as historically they are partially settled in cash. As liability awards, the fair value on which ratable expense is based, as employees vest in their rights to those awards, is remeasured each period based on the current stock price and performance achievement, and final expense is based on the market value of the award on the date the settlement date.\nCompensation costs related to share-based awards:\n(a)Compensation costs for share-based payments are included in O&M expense. Amount for equity awards (non-cash) was $25 million in 2023.\nThere was approximately $38 million and $37 million as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation awards. Xcel Energy expects to recognize the unrecognized amount over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nBasic EPS was computed by dividing the earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS was computed by dividing the earnings available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\nDiluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method.\nCommon Stock Equivalents - Common stock equivalents include commitments to issue common stock related to time-based equity compensation awards.\nStock equivalent units granted to Xcel Energy\u2019s Board of Directors are included in common shares outstanding upon grant date as there is no further service, performance or market condition following the grant of these awards. Restricted stock issued to employees under the Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan is included in common shares outstanding when granted.\nShare-based compensation arrangements for which there is currently no dilutive impact to EPS include the following:\n\u2022Equity awards subject to a performance condition; included in common shares outstanding when all necessary conditions for settlement have been satisfied by the end of the reporting period.\n\u2022Liability awards subject to a performance condition; any portions settled in shares are included in common shares outstanding upon settlement.\nCommon shares outstanding used in the basic and diluted EPS computation:\n(a)Diluted common shares outstanding included common stock equivalents of 0.3 million shares for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n10. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFair Value Measurements\nAccounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures provides a hierarchical framework for disclosing the observability of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value.\n\u2022Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are actively traded instruments with observable actual trading prices.\n\u2022Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than actual trading prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with models using highly observable inputs.\n\u2022Level 3 - Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 include those valued with models requiring significant judgment or estimation.\nSpecific valuation methods include:\nInvestments in equity securities and other funds - Equity securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets. The fair values for commingled funds are measured using NAVs. The investments in commingled funds may be redeemed for NAV with proper notice. Private equity commingled funds require approval of the fund for any unscheduled redemption, and such redemptions may be approved or denied by the fund at its sole discretion. Unscheduled distributions from real estate commingled funds may be redeemed with proper notice, however, withdrawals may be delayed or discounted as a result of fund illiquidity.\nInvestments in debt securities - Fair values for debt securities are determined by a third party pricing service using recent trades and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities.\nInterest rate derivatives - Fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on broker quotes that utilize current market interest rate forecasts.\nCommodity derivatives - Methods used to measure the fair value of commodity derivative forwards and options utilize forward prices and volatilities, as well as pricing adjustments for specific delivery locations, and are generally assigned a Level 2 classification. When contracts relate to inactive delivery locations or extend to periods beyond those readily observable on active exchanges, the significance of the use of less observable inputs on a valuation is evaluated and may result in Level 3 classification.\nElectric commodity derivatives held by NSP-Minnesota and SPS include transmission congestion instruments, generally referred to as FTRs. FTRs purchased from an RTO are financial instruments that entitle or obligate the holder to monthly revenues or charges based on transmission congestion across a given transmission path.\nThe values of these instruments are derived from, and designed to offset, the costs of transmission congestion. In addition to overall transmission load, congestion is also influenced by the operating schedules of power plants and the consumption of electricity pertinent to a given transmission path. Unplanned plant outages, scheduled plant maintenance, changes in the relative costs of fuels used in generation, weather and overall changes in demand for electricity can each impact the operating schedules of the power plants on the transmission grid and the value of these instruments.\nFTRs are recognized at fair value and adjusted each period prior to settlement. Given the limited observability of certain variables underlying the reported auction values of FTRs, these fair value measurements have been assigned a Level 3 classification.\nNet congestion costs, including the impact of FTR settlements, are shared through fuel and purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms. As such, the fair value of the unsettled instruments (i.e., derivative asset or liability) is offset/deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.\nNon-Derivative Fair Value Measurements\nNuclear Decommissioning Fund\nThe NRC requires NSP-Minnesota to maintain a portfolio of investments to fund the costs of decommissioning its nuclear generating plants. Assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund are legally restricted for the purpose of decommissioning these facilities. The fund contains cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities and other investments. NSP-Minnesota uses the MPUC approved asset allocation for the investment targets by asset class for the qualified trust.\nNSP-Minnesota recognizes the costs of funding the decommissioning over the lives of the nuclear plants, assuming rate recovery of all costs. Realized and unrealized gains on fund investments over the life of the fund are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota\u2019s regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs. Consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset.\nUnrealized gains for the nuclear decommissioning fund were $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and unrealized losses were $29 million and $90 million as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNon-derivative instruments with recurring fair value measurements in the nuclear decommissioning fund:\n(a)Reported in nuclear decommissioning fund and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, which also includes $244 million of equity method investments and $144 million of rabbi trust assets and other miscellaneous investments.\n(a)Reported in nuclear decommissioning fund and other investments on the consolidated balance sheets, which also includes $219 million of equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and $133 million of rabbi trust assets and other miscellaneous investments.\nFor the years ended Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, there were immaterial Level 3 nuclear decommissioning fund investments or transfer of amounts between levels.\nContractual maturity dates of debt securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund as of Dec. 31, 2023:\nRabbi Trusts\nXcel Energy has established rabbi trusts to provide partial funding for future deferred compensation plan distributions. The fair value of assets held in the rabbi trusts were $88 million and $80 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, comprised of cash equivalents and mutual funds (level 1 valuation methods). Amounts are reported in nuclear decommissioning fund and other investments on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDerivative Activities and Fair Value Measurements\nXcel Energy enters into derivative instruments, including forward contracts, futures, swaps and options, for trading purposes and to manage risk in connection with changes in interest rates, and utility commodity prices.\nInterest Rate Derivatives - Xcel Energy enters into contracts that effectively fix the interest rate on a specified principal amount of a hypothetical future debt issuance. These financial swaps net settle based on changes in a specified benchmark interest rate, acting as a hedge of changes in market interest rates that will impact specified anticipated debt issuances. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, with changes in fair value prior to occurrence of the hedged transactions recorded as other comprehensive income.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, accumulated other comprehensive loss related to interest rate derivatives included $2 million of net losses expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged transactions impact earnings. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Xcel Energy had unsettled interest swaps outstanding with a notional amount of $420 million. These interest rate derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges, with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income.\nSee Note 13 for the financial impact of qualifying interest rate cash flow hedges on Xcel Energy\u2019s accumulated other comprehensive loss included in the consolidated statements of common stockholder\u2019s equity and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nWholesale and Commodity Trading - Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s utility subsidiaries conduct various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. Xcel Energy is allowed to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by its risk management committee, comprised of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by this policy.\nDerivative instruments entered into for trading purposes are presented in the consolidated statements of income as electric revenues, net of any sharing with customers. These activities are not intended to mitigate commodity price risk associated with regulated electric and natural gas operations. Sharing of these margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC-approved joint operating agreement.\nCommodity Derivatives - Xcel Energy enters into derivative instruments to manage variability of future cash flows from changes in commodity prices in its electric and natural gas operations. This could include the purchase or sale of energy or energy-related products, natural gas to generate electric energy, natural gas for resale and FTRs.\nThe most significant derivative positions outstanding at Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022 for this purpose relate to FTR instruments administered by MISO and SPP. These instruments are intended to offset the impacts of transmission system congestion.\nHigher congestion costs in recent years have led to an increase in the fair value of FTRs. Settlements of FTRs are shared with electric customers through fuel and purchased energy cost-recovery mechanisms.\nWhen Xcel Energy enters into derivative instruments that mitigate commodity price risk on behalf of electric and natural gas customers, the instruments are not typically designated as qualifying hedging transactions. The classification of unrealized losses or gains on these instruments as a regulatory asset or liability, if applicable, is based on approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, Xcel Energy had no commodity contracts designated as cash flow hedges.\nGross notional amounts of commodity forwards, options and FTRs:\n(a)Not reflective of net positions in the underlying commodities.\n(b)Notional amounts for options included on a gross basis but weighted for the probability of exercise.\nConsideration of Credit Risk and Concentrations - Xcel Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its interest rate derivatives and commodity derivative contracts prior to settlement and assesses each counterparty\u2019s ability to perform on the transactions set forth in the contracts. Impact of credit risk was immaterial to the fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives presented on the consolidated balance sheets.\nXcel Energy\u2019s utility subsidiaries\u2019 most significant concentrations of credit risk with particular entities or industries are contracts with counterparties to their wholesale, trading and non-trading commodity activities.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, four of Xcel Energy\u2019s ten most significant counterparties for these activities, comprising $49 million or 23% of this credit exposure, had investment grade credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings, Moody\u2019s Investor Services or Fitch Ratings.\nFive of the ten most significant counterparties, comprising $78 million or 37% of this credit exposure, were not rated by these external ratings agencies, but based on Xcel Energy\u2019s internal analysis, had credit quality consistent with investment grade.\nOne of these significant counterparties, comprising $45 million or 21% of this credit exposure, had credit quality less than investment grade, based on internal analysis.\nEight of these significant counterparties are municipal or cooperative electric entities, RTOs or other utilities.\nCredit Related Contingent Features - Contract provisions for derivative instruments that the utility subsidiaries enter, including those accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale contracts and therefore not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, may require the posting of collateral or settlement of the contracts for various reasons, including if the applicable utility subsidiary\u2019s credit ratings are downgraded below its investment grade credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, there were $12 million and $4 million, respectively, of derivative liabilities with such underlying contract provisions, respectively.\nAlso, certain contracts may contain cross default provisions that may require the posting of collateral or settlement of the contracts if there was a failure under other financing arrangements related to payment terms or other covenants.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, there were approximately $88 million and $76 million of derivative liabilities with such underlying contract provisions, respectively.\nCertain derivative instruments are also subject to contract provisions that contain adequate assurance clauses. These provisions allow counterparties to seek performance assurance, including cash collateral, in the event that a given utility subsidiary\u2019s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations is reasonably expected to be impaired.\nXcel Energy had no collateral posted related to adequate assurance clauses in derivative contracts as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022.\nRecurring Derivative Fair Value Measurements\nImpact of derivative activity:\n(a)Recorded to interest charges.\n(b)Recorded to electric revenues. Presented amounts do not reflect non-derivative transactions or margin sharing with customers.\n(c)Recorded to electric fuel and purchased power. These derivative settlement gains and losses are shared with electric customers through fuel and purchased energy cost-recovery mechanisms and reclassified out of income as regulatory assets or liabilities, as appropriate. FTR settlements are shared with customers and do not have a material impact on net income. Presented amounts reflect changes in fair value between FTR auction and settlement dates, but exclude the original auction fair value.\n(d)Recorded to cost of natural gas sold and transported. These losses are subject to cost-recovery mechanisms and reclassified out of income to a regulatory asset, as appropriate.\n(e)Relates primarily to option premium amortization.\nXcel Energy had no derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges during the years ended Dec. 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nDerivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:\n(a)Xcel Energy nets derivative instruments and related collateral on its consolidated balance sheets when supported by a legally enforceable master netting agreement. At Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, derivative assets and liabilities include no obligations to return cash collateral. At Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, derivative assets and liabilities include rights to reclaim cash collateral of $7 million and $53 million, respectively. Counterparty netting amounts presented exclude settlement receivables and payables and non-derivative amounts that may be subject to the same master netting agreements.\n(b)Xcel Energy currently applies the normal purchase exception to qualifying PPAs. Balance relates to specific contracts that were previously recognized at fair value prior to applying the normal purchase exception, and are being amortized over the remaining contract lives along with the offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.\nChanges in Level 3 commodity derivatives:\n(a)Relates primarily to NSP-Minnesota and SPS FTR instruments administered by MISO and SPP.\n(b)Relates to commodity trading and is subject to substantial offsetting losses and gains on derivative instruments categorized as levels 1 and 2 in the income statement. See above tables for the income statement impact of derivative activity, including commodity trading gains and losses.\nFair Value of Long-Term Debt\nAs of Dec. 31, other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal fair value:\nFair value of Xcel Energy\u2019s long-term debt is estimated based on recent trades and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities. Fair value estimates are based on information available to management as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, and given the observability of the inputs, fair values presented for long-term debt were assigned as Level 2.\n11. Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\nPension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits\nXcel Energy has several noncontributory, qualified, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all employees. All newly hired or rehired employees participate under the Cash Balance formula, which is based on pay credits using a percentage of annual eligible pay and annual interest credits.\nThe average annual interest crediting rates for these plans was 4.72, 4.89 and 2.03% in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nSome employees may participate under legacy formulas such as the traditional final average pay or pension equity. Xcel Energy\u2019s policy is to fully fund into an external trust the actuarially determined pension costs subject to the limitations of applicable employee benefit and tax laws.\nIn addition to the qualified pension plans, Xcel Energy maintains a SERP and a nonqualified pension plan. The SERP is maintained for certain executives who participated in the plan in 2008, when the SERP was closed to new participants.\nThe nonqualified pension plan provides benefits for compensation that is in excess of the limits applicable to the qualified pension plans, with distributions funded by Xcel Energy\u2019s consolidated operating cash flows.\nObligations of the SERP and nonqualified plan as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022 were $12 million and $11 million, respectively. Xcel Energy recognized net benefit cost for the SERP and nonqualified plans of $2 million in 2023 and $17 million in 2022.\nXcel Energy\u2019s postretirement health care benefit plan is a continuation of certain welfare benefit programs for current employees. A full time employee\u2019s date of hire or a retiree\u2019s date of retirement determine eligibility for each of the programs.\nXcel Energy\u2019s investment-return assumption considers the expected long-term performance for each of the asset classes in its pension and postretirement health care portfolio. Xcel Energy considers the historical returns achieved by its asset portfolios over long time periods, as well as the long-term projected return levels from investment experts.\nPension cost determination assumes a forecasted mix of investment types over the long-term.\n\u2022Investment returns in 2023 were above the assumed level of 6.93%.\n\u2022Investment returns in 2022 were below the assumed level of 6.49%.\n\u2022Investment returns in 2021 were above the assumed level of 6.49%.\n\u2022In 2024, expected investment-return assumption is 6.93%.\nPension plan and postretirement benefit assets are invested in a portfolio according to Xcel Energy\u2019s return, liquidity and diversification objectives to provide a source of funding for plan obligations and minimize contributions to the plan, within appropriate levels of risk.\nThe principal mechanism for achieving these objectives is the asset allocation given the long-term risk, return, correlation and liquidity characteristics of each particular asset class.\nThere were no significant concentrations of risk in any industry, index, or entity. Market volatility can impact even well-diversified portfolios and significantly affect the return levels achieved by the assets in any year.\nState agencies also have issued guidelines to the funding of postretirement benefit costs. SPS is required to fund postretirement benefit plans for Texas and New Mexico equal to amounts collected in rates. These assets are invested in a manner consistent with the investment strategy for the pension plan.\nXcel Energy\u2019s ongoing investment strategy is based on plan-specific investment recommendations that seek to minimize potential investment and interest rate risk as a plan\u2019s funded status increases over time.\nThe investment recommendations consider many factors and generally result in a greater percentage of long-duration fixed income securities being allocated to specific plans having relatively higher funded status ratios and a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having relatively lower funded status ratios.\nPlan Assets\nFor each of the fair value hierarchy levels, Xcel Energy\u2019s pension plan assets measured at fair value:\n(a)See Note 10 for further information regarding fair value measurement inputs and methods.\nFor each of the fair value hierarchy levels, Xcel Energy\u2019s postretirement benefit plan assets that were measured at fair value:\n(a)See Note 10 for further information on fair value measurement inputs and methods.\nImmaterial assets were transferred in or out of Level 3 for 2023 and 2022.\nFunded Status - Comparisons of the actuarially computed benefit obligation, changes in plan assets and funded status of the pension and postretirement health care plans for Xcel Energy are as follows:\n(a)Includes lump-sum benefit payments used in the determination of a settlement charges of $195 million of in 2022.\nAccumulated benefit obligation for the pension plan was $2,728 million and $2,672 million as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit) - Net periodic benefit cost (credit), other than the service cost component, is included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of income.\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost (credit) and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income and regulatory assets and liabilities:\n(a)A settlement charge is required when the amount of all lump-sum distributions during the year is greater than the sum of the service and interest cost components of the annual net periodic pension cost. There were no settlement charges recorded for the qualified pension plans in 2023. In 2022 and 2021, as a result of lump-sum distributions during each plan year, Xcel Energy recorded a total pension settlement charge of $71 million and $59 million, respectively, the majority of which was not recognized due to the effects of regulation. A total of $9 million and $7 million was recorded in the consolidated statements of income in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCash Flows - Funding requirements can be impacted by changes to actuarial assumptions, actual asset levels and other calculations prescribed by the requirements of income tax and other pension-related regulations. Required contributions were made in 2021 - 2024 to meet minimum funding requirements.\nVoluntary and required pension funding contributions:\n\u2022$100 million in January 2024.\n\u2022$50 million in 2023.\n\u2022$50 million in 2022.\n\u2022$131 million in 2021.\nThe postretirement health care plans have no funding requirements other than fulfilling benefit payment obligations when claims are presented and approved. Additional cash funding requirements are prescribed by certain state and federal rate regulatory authorities.\nVoluntary postretirement funding contributions:\n\u2022$11 million expected during 2024.\n\u2022$11 million during 2023.\n\u2022$13 million during 2022.\n\u2022$15 million during 2021.\nTargeted asset allocations:\nThe asset allocations above reflect target allocations approved in the calendar year to take effect in the subsequent year.\nPlan Amendments - In 2023, Xcel Energy amended the Xcel Energy Pension Plan and Xcel Energy Inc. Nonbargaining Pension Plan (South) to reduce supplemental social security benefits for all active participants on and after Jan. 1, 2024.\nThere were no significant plan amendments made in 2022 which affected the postretirement benefit obligation.\nIn 2021, Xcel Energy amended the Xcel Energy Pension Plan and Xcel Energy Inc. Nonbargaining Pension Plan (South) to reduce supplemental benefits for non-bargaining participants as well as to allow the transfer of a portion of non-qualified pension obligations into the qualified plans.\nProjected Benefit Payments\nXcel Energy\u2019s projected benefit payments:\nVoluntary Retirement Program\nIncremental to amounts presented above for postretirement benefits, Xcel Energy recognized new postemployment costs and obligations in the fourth quarter of 2023 for employees accepted to a voluntary retirement program.\nUtilizing employee information and the following inputs, the estimated costs of the program of $34 million for health plan subsidies and $5 million for other medical benefits, each commencing in 2024, were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023. These unfunded obligations are presented in other current liabilities and noncurrent pension and employee benefit obligations in the consolidated balance sheet as of Dec. 31, 2023.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nXcel Energy maintains 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that cover most employees. Total expense to these plans was approximately\n$49 million in 2023, $46 million in 2022 and $43 million in 2021.\nMultiemployer Plans\nNSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin each contribute to several union multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit plans, none of which are individually significant. These plans provide pension and postretirement health care benefits to certain union employees who may perform services for multiple employers and do not participate in the NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin sponsored pension and postretirement health care plans.\nContributing to these types of plans creates risk that differs from providing benefits under NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin sponsored plans, in that if another participating employer ceases to contribute to a multiemployer pension plan, additional unfunded obligations may need to be funded over time by remaining participating employers.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal\nXcel Energy is involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management maintains accruals for losses probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation.\nManagement is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of a reasonably possible loss in certain situations, including but not limited to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories.\nIn such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution, including a possible eventual loss. For current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on Xcel Energy\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Legal fees are generally expensed as incurred.\nGas Trading Litigation - e prime is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy. e prime was in the business of natural gas trading and marketing but has not engaged in natural gas trading or marketing activities since 2003. Multiple lawsuits involving multiple plaintiffs seeking monetary damages were commenced against e prime and its affiliates, including Xcel Energy, between 2003 and 2009 alleging fraud and anticompetitive activities in conspiring to restrain the trade of natural gas and manipulate natural gas prices. Cases were all consolidated in the U.S. District Court in Nevada.\nOne case remains active which includes a multi-district litigation matter consisting of a Wisconsin purported class (Arandell Corp.). The Court issued a ruling in June 2022 granting plaintiffs\u2019 class certification. In April 2023, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals heard the defendants\u2019 appeal challenging whether the district court properly assessed class certification. A decision relating to class certification is expected imminently. Xcel Energy considers the reasonably possible loss associated with this litigation to be immaterial.\nComanche Unit 3 Litigation - In 2021, CORE filed a lawsuit in Denver County District Court, alleging PSCo breached ownership agreement terms by failing to operate Comanche Unit 3 in accordance with prudent utility practices. In April 2022, CORE filed a supplement to include damages related to a 2022 outage. Also in 2022, CORE sent notice of withdrawal from the ownership agreement based on the same alleged breaches.\nIn February 2023, the court granted PSCo\u2019s motion precluding CORE from seeking damages related to its withdrawal as part of the lawsuit. In October 2023, the jury ruled that CORE may not withdraw as a joint owner of the facility but awarded CORE lost power damages of $26 million. PSCo recognized a $34 million loss for the verdict in the third quarter of 2023, including estimated interest and other costs. PSCo intends to file an appeal of this decision.\nMarshall Wildfire Litigation - In December 2021, a wildfire ignited in Boulder County, Colorado (the \u201cMarshall Fire\u201d), which burned over 6,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 structures. On June 8, 2023, the Boulder County Sheriff\u2019s Office released its Marshall Fire Investigative Summary and Review and its supporting documents (the \u201cSheriff\u2019s Report\u201d). According to an October 2022 statement from the Colorado Insurance Commissioner, the Marshall Fire is estimated to have caused more than $2 billion in property losses.\nAccording to the Sheriff\u2019s Report, on Dec. 30, 2021, a fire ignited on a residential property in Boulder, Colorado, located in PSCo\u2019s service territory, for reasons unrelated to PSCo\u2019s power lines. According to the Sheriff\u2019s Report, approximately one hour and 20 minutes after the first ignition, a second fire ignited just south of the Marshall Mesa Trailhead in unincorporated Boulder County, Colorado, also located in PSCo\u2019s service territory. According to the Sheriff\u2019s Report, the second ignition started approximately 80 to 110 feet away from PSCo\u2019s power lines in the area.\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Report states that the most probable cause of the second ignition was hot particles discharged from PSCo\u2019s power lines after one of the power lines detached from its insulator in strong winds, and further states that it cannot be ruled out that the second ignition was caused by an underground coal fire. According to the Sheriff\u2019s Report, no design, installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies were identified on PSCo\u2019s electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition. PSCo disputes that its power lines caused the second ignition.\nPSCo is aware of 302 complaints, most of which have also named Xcel Energy Inc. and Xcel Energy Services, Inc. as additional defendants, relating to the Marshall Fire. The complaints are on behalf of at least 4,047 plaintiffs, and one complaint is filed on behalf of a putative class of first responders who allegedly were exposed to the threat of serious bodily injury, or smoke, soot and ash from the Marshall Fire. The complaints generally allege that PSCo\u2019s equipment ignited the Marshall Fire and assert various causes of action under Colorado law, including negligence, premises liability, trespass, nuisance, wrongful death, willful and wanton conduct, negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of consortium and inverse condemnation. In addition to seeking compensatory damages, certain of the complaints also seek exemplary damages.\nIn September 2023, the Boulder County District Court Judge consolidated eight lawsuits that were pending at that time into a single action for pretrial purposes and has subsequently consolidated additional lawsuits that have been filed. At the case management conference in February 2024, a trial date was set for September 2025.\nColorado courts do not apply strict liability in determining an electric utility company\u2019s liability for fire-related damages. For inverse condemnation claims, Colorado courts assess whether a defendant acted with intent to take a plaintiff\u2019s property or intentionally took an action which has the natural consequence of taking the property. For negligence claims, Colorado courts look to whether electric power companies have operated their system with a heightened duty of care consistent with the practical conduct of its business, and liability does not extend to occurrences that cannot be reasonably anticipated.\nColorado law does not impose joint and several liability in tort actions. Instead, under Colorado law, a defendant is liable for the degree or percentage of the negligence or fault attributable to that defendant, except where the defendant conspired with another defendant. A jury\u2019s verdict in a Colorado civil case must be unanimous. Under Colorado law, in a civil action other than a medical malpractice action, the total award for noneconomic loss is capped at $0.6 million per defendant for claims that accrued at the time of the Marshall Fire unless the court finds justification to exceed that amount by clear and convincing evidence, in which case the maximum doubles.\nColorado law caps punitive or exemplary damages to an amount equal to the amount of the actual damages awarded to the injured party, except the court may increase any award of punitive damages to a sum up to three times the amount of actual damages if the conduct that is the subject of the claim has continued during the pendency of the case or the defendant has acted in a willful and wanton manner during the action which further aggravated plaintiff\u2019s damages.\nIn the event Xcel Energy Inc. or PSCo was found liable related to this litigation and were required to pay damages, such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage of approximately $500 million and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, due to uncertainty as to the cause of the fire and the extent and magnitude of potential damages, Xcel Energy Inc. and PSCo are unable to estimate the amount or range of possible losses in connection with the Marshall Fire.\nRate Matters and Other\nXcel Energy\u2019s operating subsidiaries are involved in various regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Until resolution, typically in the form of a rate order, uncertainties may exist regarding the ultimate rate treatment for certain activities and transactions. Amounts have been recognized for probable and reasonably estimable losses that may result. Unless otherwise disclosed, any reasonably possible range of loss in excess of any recognized amount is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nSherco - In 2018, NSP-Minnesota and SMMPA (Co-owner of Sherco Unit 3) reached a settlement with GE related to a 2011 incident, which damaged the turbine at Sherco Unit 3 and resulted in an extended outage. NSP-Minnesota notified the MPUC of its proposal to refund settlement proceeds to customers through the FCA.\nIn March 2019, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota\u2019s settlement refund proposal. Additionally, the MPUC decided to withhold any decision as to NSP-Minnesota\u2019s prudence in connection with the incident at Sherco Unit 3 until after conclusion of an appeal pending between GE and NSP-Minnesota\u2019s insurers. In February 2020, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of GE.\nIn January 2021, the OAG and DOC recommended that NSP-Minnesota refund approximately $17 million of replacement power costs previously recovered through the FCA. NSP-Minnesota responded that it acted prudently in connection with the Sherco Unit 3 outage, the MPUC has previously disallowed $22 million of related costs and no additional refund or disallowance is appropriate.\nIn July 2022, the MPUC referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings to conduct a contested case on the prudence of the replacement power costs incurred by NSP-Minnesota. In 2023, NSP-Minnesota and various parties filed recommendations, including the DOC which recommended a $56 million customer refund. The Xcel Large Industrial customer group recommended a refund of $72 million. A final decision by the MPUC is expected in mid-2024. A loss related to this matter is deemed remote.\nMISO ROE Complaints - In November 2013 and February 2015, customer groups filed two ROE complaints against MISO TOs, which includes NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. The first complaint requested a reduction in base ROE transmission formula rates from 12.38% to 9.15% for the time period of Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015, and removal of ROE adders (including those for RTO membership). The second complaint requested, for a subsequent time period, a base ROE reduction from 12.38% to 8.67%.\nThe FERC subsequently issued various related orders related to ROE methodology/calculations and timing. NSP-Minnesota has processed refunds to customers for applicable complaint periods based on the ROE in the most recent applicable opinions.\nThe MISO TOs and various other parties have filed petitions for review of the FERC\u2019s most recent applicable opinions at the D.C. Circuit. In August 2022, the D.C. Circuit ruled that FERC had not adequately supported its conclusions, vacated FERC\u2019s related orders and remanded the issue back to FERC for further proceedings, which remain pending. Additional exposure, if any related to this matter is expected to be immaterial.\nEnvironmental\nNew and changing federal and state environmental mandates can create financial liabilities for Xcel Energy, which are normally recovered through the regulated rate process.\nSite Remediation\nVarious federal and state environmental laws impose liability where hazardous substances or other regulated materials have been released to the environment. Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries may sometimes pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where past activities of their predecessors or other parties have caused environmental contamination.\nEnvironmental contingencies could arise from various situations, including sites of former MGPs; and third-party sites, such as landfills, for which one or more of Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries are alleged to have sent wastes to that site.\nMGP, Landfill and Disposal Sites\nXcel Energy is investigating, remediating or performing post-closure actions at 12 historical MGP, landfill or other disposal sites across its service territories, excluding sites that are being addressed under current coal ash regulations (see below).\nXcel Energy has recognized approximately $20 million of costs/liabilities from final resolution of these issues; however, the outcome and timing are unknown. In addition, there may be insurance recovery and/or recovery from other potentially responsible parties, offsetting a portion of costs incurred.\nEnvironmental Requirements - Water and Waste\nCoal Ash Regulation - Xcel Energy\u2019s operations are subject to federal and state regulations that impose requirements for handling, storage, treatment and disposal of solid waste, including the CCR Rule. As a specific requirement of the CCR Rule, utilities must complete groundwater sampling around their applicable landfills and surface impoundments as well as perform corrective actions where offsite groundwater has been impacted.\nIf certain impacts to groundwater are detected, utilities are required to perform additional groundwater investigations and/or perform corrective actions beginning with an Assessment of Corrective Measures.\nInvestigation and/or corrective action related to groundwater impacts are currently underway at four Xcel Energy sites under the federal CCR program at a current estimated cost of at least $40 million. A liability has been recorded and is expected to be fully recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.\nFor required coal ash disposal, PSCo has executed an agreement with a third party that will excavate and process ash for beneficial use (at two sites) at a cost of approximately $45 million. An estimated liability has been recorded and amounts are expected to be fully recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.\nFederal Clean Water Act Section 316(b) - The Federal Clean Water Act requires the EPA to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure they reflect the best technology available for minimizing impingement and entrainment of aquatic species.\nEstimated capital expenditures of approximately $50 million may be required to comply with the requirements. Xcel Energy anticipates these costs will be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.\nEnvironmental Requirements - Air\nClean Air Act NOx Allowance Allocations - In June 2023, the EPA published final regulations for ozone under the \u201cGood Neighbor\u201d provisions of the Clean Air Act. The final rule applies to generation facilities in Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin, as well as other states outside of our service territory. The rule establishes an allowance trading program for NOx that will impact subject Xcel Energy fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. Subject facilities will have to secure additional allowances, install NOx controls and/or develop a strategy of operations that utilizes the existing allowance allocations. Guidelines are also established for allowance banking and emission limit backstops.\nWhile the financial impacts of the final rule are uncertain and dependent on market forces and anticipated generation, Xcel Energy anticipates the annual costs could be significant, but would be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.\nSPS and NSP-Minnesota have joined other companies in litigation challenging the EPA\u2019s disapproval of Texas and Minnesota state implementation plans. Currently, the regulation is under a judicial stay for both Texas and Minnesota. The regulation may become applicable in those states in the future, depending on the outcome of the litigation. The rule is in effect in NSP-Wisconsin but has been managed without the additional need for allowances.\nIn February 2024, the EPA proposed to partially disapprove New Mexico\u2019s state implementation plan and bring New Mexico into the federal Good Neighbor plan. Xcel Energy continues to evaluate impacts to generation units at SPS.\nRegional Haze Rules - The EPA has proposed rules addressing Regional Haze compliance in Texas, which address requirements for reasonable progress at Tolk and BART at Harrington. As proposed, these rules would not require additional controls at either facility, in part due to the conversion of Harrington to gas in 2025 and the planned retirement of Tolk. These rules will be monitored until final versions are published.\nAROs - AROs have been recorded for Xcel Energy\u2019s assets. For nuclear assets, the ARO is associated with the decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota nuclear generating plants.\nAggregate fair value of NSP-Minnesota\u2019s legally restricted assets, for funding future nuclear decommissioning was $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nXcel Energy\u2019s AROs were as follows:\n(a)Amounts incurred relate to the Northern Wind farm placed in service in NSP-Minnesota.\n(b)In 2023, AROs were revised for changes in timing and estimates of cash flows. Revisions in wind and nuclear AROs were primarily incurred due to changes in useful lives. Changes in gas transmission and distribution AROs were a result of updated gas line mileage and number of services, as well as changes to inflation and discount rate assumptions.\n(a)Amounts incurred related to the wind farms placed in service in 2022 for NSP-Minnesota (Dakota Range and Rock Aetna) and steam production pond remediation costs for PSCo.\n(b)In 2022, AROs were revised for changes in timing and estimates of cash flows. Revisions in steam, hydro and other production AROs were primarily related to changes in cost estimates for remediation of ash containment facilities. Changes in gas transmission and distribution AROs were primarily related to changes in labor rates coupled with increased gas line mileage and number of services.\n(c)Prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.\nIndeterminate AROs - Outside of the recorded asbestos AROs, other plants or buildings may contain asbestos due to the age of many of Xcel Energy\u2019s facilities, but no confirmation or measurement of the cost of removal could be determined as of Dec. 31, 2023. Therefore, an ARO was not recorded for these facilities.\nNuclear\nNuclear Insurance - NSP-Minnesota\u2019s public liability for claims from any nuclear incident is limited to $16.2 billion under the Price-Anderson amendment to the Atomic Energy Act. NSP-Minnesota has $450 million of coverage for its public liability exposure with a pool of insurance companies. The remaining $15.8 billion of exposure is funded by the Secondary Financial Protection Program available from assessments by the federal government.\nNSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to $166 million per reactor-incident for each of its three reactors, for public liability arising from a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear facility in the United States. The maximum funding requirement is $25 million per reactor-incident during any one year. Maximum assessments are subject to inflation adjustments.\nNSP-Minnesota purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from NEIL and EMANI. The coverage limits are $2.8 billion for each of NSP-Minnesota\u2019s two nuclear plant sites. NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage up to $490 million and $420 million at Monticello and Prairie Island, respectively, including the cost of replacement power during prolonged accidental outages of nuclear generating units. Premiums are expensed over the policy term.\nAll companies insured with NEIL are subject to retroactive premium adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated in the reserve funds of NEIL and EMANI to the extent that NSP-Minnesota would have no exposure for retroactive premium assessments in case of a single incident under the business interruption and the property damage insurance coverage.\nNSP-Minnesota could be subject to annual maximum assessments of $15 million for business interruption insurance and $32 million for property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.\nNuclear Fuel Disposal - NSP-Minnesota is responsible for temporarily storing spent nuclear fuel from its nuclear plants. The DOE is responsible for permanently storing spent fuel from U.S. nuclear plants, but no such facility is yet available.\nNSP-Minnesota owns temporary on-site storage facilities for spent fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear plants, which consist of storage pools and dry cask facilities. The Monticello dry-cask storage facility currently stores all 30 of the authorized canisters. Monticello\u2019s future spent fuel will continue to be placed in its spent fuel pool. The decommissioning plan addresses the disposition of spent fuel at the end of the licensed life. In October 2023, a CON for additional storage at the Monticello site was approved by the MPUC to support possible life extension to 2040.\nThe PI dry-cask storage facility currently stores 50 of the 64 authorized casks. In February 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a CON with the MPUC for additional storage at PI to support possible life extension to 2054.\nRegulatory Plant Decommissioning Recovery - Decommissioning activities for NSP-Minnesota\u2019s nuclear facilities are planned to begin at the end of each unit\u2019s authorized retirement dates, which can be different than the currently approved NRC operating licenses. These decommissioning activities are planned to be completed at both facilities by 2101.\nNSP-Minnesota\u2019s current operating licenses allow continued use of its Monticello nuclear plant until 2030 and its PI nuclear plant until 2033 for Unit 1 and 2034 for Unit 2. The MPUC reaffirmed a 60-year DECON scenario, where Monticello continues operations under a 10-year license extension (approved in August 2022). NRC approval of the extension is pending.\nIn February 2023, NSP-Minnesota also filed an application with the NDPSC for an Advance Determination of Prudence for continued operation of the Monticello Plant until at least 2040. A decision is expected in 2024.\nFuture decommissioning costs of nuclear facilities are estimated through triennial periodic studies that assess the costs and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities for each unit. The MPUC ordered the next triennial decommissioning study be filed by Dec. 1, 2024.\nObligations for decommissioning are expected to be funded 100% by the external decommissioning trust fund. NSP-Minnesota had $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion of assets held in external decommissioning trusts at Dec. 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.\nLeases\nXcel Energy evaluates contracts that may contain leases, including PPAs and arrangements for the use of office space and other facilities, vehicles and equipment. A contract contains a lease if it conveys the exclusive right to control the use of a specific asset. A contract determined to contain a lease is evaluated further to determine if the arrangement is a finance lease.\nROU assets represent Xcel Energy's rights to use leased assets. The present value of future operating lease payments is recognized in other current liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities. These amounts, adjusted for any prepayments or incentives, are recognized as operating lease ROU assets.\nMost of Xcel Energy\u2019s leases do not contain a readily determinable discount rate. Therefore, the present value of future lease payments is generally calculated using the applicable Xcel Energy subsidiary\u2019s estimated incremental borrowing rate (weighted average of 4.4%). For currently exiting asset classes, Xcel Energy has elected the practical expedient under which non-lease components, such as asset maintenance costs included in payments, are not deducted from lease payments for the purposes of lease accounting and disclosure.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are classified as short-term leases and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.\nOperating lease ROU assets:\nROU assets for finance leases are included in other noncurrent assets, and the present value of future finance lease payments is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\nXcel Energy\u2019s most significant finance lease activities are related to WYCO, a joint venture with CIG, to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities. Xcel Energy Inc. has a 50% ownership interest in WYCO. WYCO leases its facilities to CIG, and CIG operates the facilities, providing natural gas storage and transportation services to PSCo under separate service agreements.\nPSCo accounts for its Totem natural gas storage service and Front Range pipeline arrangements with CIG and WYCO, respectively, as finance leases. Xcel Energy Inc. eliminates 50% of the finance lease obligation related to WYCO in the consolidated balance sheet along with an equal amount of Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s equity investment in WYCO.\nFinance lease ROU assets:\nComponents of lease expense:\n(a)Includes short-term lease expense of $3 million, $6 million, and $5 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(b)PPA capacity payments are included in electric fuel and purchased power on the consolidated statements of income. Expense for other operating leases is included in O&M expense and electric fuel and purchased power.\nCommitments under operating and finance leases as of Dec. 31, 2023:\n(a)Amounts do not include PPAs accounted for as executory contracts and/or contingent payments, such as energy payments on renewable PPAs.\n(b)PPA operating leases contractually expire at various dates through 2039.\n(c)Excludes certain amounts related to Xcel Energy\u2019s 50% ownership interest in WYCO.\nPPAs and Fuel Contracts\nNon-Lease PPAs - NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS have entered into PPAs with other utilities and energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and energy requirements, operating reserve obligations and as part of wholesale and commodity trading activities. In general, these agreements provide for energy payments, based on actual energy delivered, and may also include capacity payments. Certain non-lease PPAs with various expiration dates through 2033, contain minimum energy purchase commitments. Total energy payments on those contracts were $214 million, $182 million and $149 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIncluded in electric fuel and purchased power expenses for PPAs accounted for as executory contracts were payments for capacity of $77 million, $75 million and $69 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCapacity and energy payments are contingent on the IPPs meeting contract obligations, including plant availability requirements. Certain contractual payments are adjusted based on market indices. The effects of price adjustments on financial results are mitigated through purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms.\nAt Dec. 31, 2023, the estimated future payments for capacity and energy that the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy are obligated to purchase pursuant to these non-lease contracts, subject to availability, were as follows:\n(a)Excludes contingent energy payments for renewable energy PPAs.\nFuel Contracts - Xcel Energy has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements. These contracts expire between 2024 and 2060. Xcel Energy is required to pay additional amounts depending on actual quantities delivered under these agreements.\nEstimated minimum purchases under these contracts as of Dec. 31, 2023:\nVIEs\nPPAs - Under certain PPAs, NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS purchase power from IPPs for which the utility subsidiaries are required to reimburse fuel costs, or to participate in tolling arrangements under which the utility subsidiaries procure the natural gas required to produce the energy that they purchase. Xcel Energy has determined that certain IPPs are VIEs, however Xcel Energy is not subject to risk of loss from the operations of these entities, and no significant financial support is required other than contractual payments for energy and capacity.\nIn addition, certain solar PPAs provide an option to purchase emission allowances or sharing provisions related to production credits generated by the solar facility under contract. These specific PPAs create a variable interest in the IPP.\nXcel Energy evaluated each of these VIEs for possible consolidation, including review of qualitative factors such as the length and terms of the contract, control over O&M, control over dispatch of electricity, historical and estimated future fuel and electricity prices and financing activities. Xcel Energy concluded that these entities are not required to be consolidated in its consolidated financial statements because Xcel Energy does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance.\nThe utility subsidiaries had approximately 3,751 MW and 3,961 MW of capacity under long-term PPAs at Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with entities that have been determined to be VIEs. These agreements have expiration dates through 2041.\nFuel Contracts - SPS purchases all of its coal requirements for its Harrington and Tolk plants from TUCO Inc. under contracts that will expire in December 2024 and December 2027, respectively. TUCO arranges for the purchase, receiving, transporting, unloading, handling, crushing, weighing and delivery of coal to meet SPS\u2019 requirements. TUCO is responsible for negotiating and administering contracts with coal suppliers, transporters and handlers.\nSPS has not provided any significant financial support to TUCO, other than contractual payments for delivered coal. However, the fuel contracts create a variable interest in TUCO due to SPS\u2019 reimbursement of fuel procurement costs.\nSPS has determined that TUCO is a VIE, however it has concluded that SPS is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact TUCO\u2019s economic performance.\nLow-Income Housing Limited Partnerships - Eloigne and NSP-Wisconsin have entered into limited partnerships with affordable rental housing activities that qualify for low-income housing tax credits.\nEloigne and NSP-Wisconsin, as primary beneficiaries of these activities, consolidate these limited partnerships in their consolidated financial statements.\nAmounts reflected in Xcel Energy\u2019s consolidated balance sheets for these investments include $41 million of assets and $35 million of liabilities at Dec. 31, 2023, and $44 million of assets and $35 million of liabilities at Dec. 31, 2022.\nOther\nTechnology Agreements - Xcel Energy has several contracts for information technology services that extend through 2027. The contracts are cancelable, although there are financial penalties for early termination.\nXcel Energy capitalized or expensed $28 million, $181 million and $103 million associated with these vendors in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCommitted minimum payments under these obligations as follows:\nGuarantees and Bond Indemnifications - Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries provide guarantees and bond indemnities, which guarantee payment or performance. Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s exposure is based upon the net liability under the specified agreements or transactions.

Segment Information\nXcel Energy evaluates performance by each utility subsidiary based on profit or loss generated from the product or service provided, including the regulated electric utility operating results of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS, as well as the regulated natural gas utility operating results of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and PSCo. These segments are managed separately because the revenue streams are dependent upon regulated rate recovery, which is separately determined for each segment.\nXcel Energy has the following reportable segments:\n\u2022Regulated Electric - The regulated electric utility segment generates, purchases, transmits, distributes and sells electricity in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. In addition, this segment includes sales for resale and provides wholesale transmission service to various entities in the United States. The regulated electric utility segment also includes wholesale commodity and trading operations.\n\u2022Regulated Natural Gas - The regulated natural gas utility segment purchases, transports, stores, distributes and sells natural gas primarily in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin.\nXcel Energy also presents All Other, which includes operating segments with revenues below the necessary quantitative thresholds. Those operating segments primarily include steam revenue, appliance repair services, non-utility real estate activities, revenues associated with processing solid waste into RDF, investments in rental housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax credits and equity method investments in EIP funds.\nXcel Energy had equity method investments of $244 million and $219 million as of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, included in the natural gas utility and all other segments.\nAsset and capital expenditure information is not provided for Xcel Energy\u2019s reportable segments. As an integrated electric and natural gas utility, Xcel Energy operates significant assets that are not dedicated to a specific business segment.\nReporting assets and capital expenditures by business segment would require arbitrary and potentially misleading allocations, which may not necessarily reflect the assets that would be required for the operation of the business segments on a stand-alone basis.\nCertain costs, such as common depreciation, common O&M expenses and interest expense are allocated based on cost causation allocators across each segment. In addition, a general allocator is used for certain general and administrative expenses, including office supplies, rent, property insurance and general advertising.\nXcel Energy\u2019s segment information:\n15. Workforce Reduction\nIn 2023, Xcel Energy implemented workforce actions to align resources and investments with evolving business and customer needs, and streamline the organization for long-term success.\nIn September 2023, Xcel Energy announced a voluntary retirement program to a group of eligible non-bargaining employees, with an enhanced retirement package including certain health care and cash benefits for accepted employees. Approximately 400 employees retired under this program in December 2023.\nIn November 2023, Xcel Energy, Inc. also reduced its non-bargaining workforce by approximately 150 employees through an involuntary severance program.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Xcel Energy recorded total expense of $72 million related to these workforce actions, primarily related to the estimated cost of future health plan subsidies and other medical benefits for the voluntary retirement program, as well as severance and other employee payouts and legal and other professional fees.\nFor further information on the estimated costs and obligations for future health plan subsidies and other medical benefits, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.",

Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s investments in subsidiaries are presented under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are not consolidated. The investments in net assets of the subsidiaries are recorded in the balance sheets. The income from operations of the subsidiaries is reported on a net basis as equity in income of subsidiaries.\nAs a holding company with no business operations, Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s assets consist primarily of investments in its utility subsidiaries. Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s material cash inflows are only from dividends and other payments received from its utility subsidiaries and the proceeds raised from the sale of debt and equity securities. The ability of its utility subsidiaries to make dividend and other payments is subject to the availability of funds after taking into account their respective funding requirements, the terms of their respective indebtedness, the regulations of the FERC under the Federal Power Act, and applicable state laws. Management does not expect maintaining these requirements to have an impact on Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future. Each of its utility subsidiaries, however, is legally distinct and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to Xcel Energy Inc.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nXcel Energy Inc. provides guarantees and bond indemnities under specified agreements or transactions, which guarantee payment or performance. Xcel Energy Inc.\u2019s exposure is based upon the net liability of the relevant subsidiary under the specified agreements or transactions. Most of the guarantees and bond indemnities issued by Xcel Energy Inc. limit the exposure to a maximum stated amount. As of Dec. 31, 2023 and 2022, Xcel Energy Inc. had no assets held as collateral related to guarantees, bond indemnities and indemnification agreements.\nGuarantees and bond indemnities issued and outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2023:\n(a)Guarantees expire upon the satisfaction of all buyer obligations under the purchase contracts.\n(b)Given that the manufacturing of equipment has not yet commenced, related exposure to the performance obligations of Capital Services at Dec. 31, 2023 has been assessed as immaterial.\n(c)Nonperformance and/or nonpayment.\n(d)Exposure to the performance obligations of the utility subsidiaries has been assessed as immaterial. The tax credit sales transactions closed as scheduled in January 2024.\n(e)The surety bonds primarily relate to workers compensation benefits and utility projects. The workers compensation bonds are renewed annually and the project based bonds expire in conjunction with the completion of the related projects.\n(f)Due to the number of projects associated with the surety bonds, the total current exposure of this indemnification cannot be determined. Xcel Energy Inc. believes the exposure to be significantly less than the total amount of the outstanding bonds.\n(g)Per the indemnity agreement between Xcel Energy Inc. and the various surety companies, surety companies have the discretion to demand that collateral be posted.\nIndemnification Agreements\nXcel Energy Inc. provides indemnifications through contracts entered into in the normal course of business. Indemnifications are primarily against adverse litigation outcomes in connection with underwriting agreements, breaches of representations and warranties, including corporate existence, transaction authorization and certain income tax matters. Obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of duration or amount. Maximum future payments under these indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated as the dollar amounts are often not explicitly stated.\nRelated Party Transactions - Xcel Energy Inc. presents related party receivables net of payables. Accounts receivable net of payables with affiliates at Dec. 31:\nDividends - Cash dividends paid to Xcel Energy Inc. by its subsidiaries were $1,693 million, $1,503 million and $1,344 million for the years ended Dec. 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These cash receipts are included in operating cash flows of the condensed statements of cash flows.\nMoney Pool - FERC approval was received to establish a utility money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, subject to receipt of required state regulatory approvals. The utility money pool allows for short-term investments in and borrowings between the utility subsidiaries. Xcel Energy Inc. may make investments in the utility subsidiaries at market-based interest rates; however, the money pool arrangement does not allow the utility subsidiaries to make investments in Xcel Energy Inc.\nMoney pool lending for Xcel Energy Inc.:\nSee notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.\nSCHEDULE II\nXcel Energy Inc. and Subsidiaries Valuation and Qualifying Accounts Years Ended Dec. 31\n(a)Recovery of amounts previously written-off.\n(b)Deductions related primarily to bad debt write-offs.\n(c)Primarily reversals of valuation allowances on completed tax credit sales and reductions of valuation allowances for items forecasted to be used prior to expiration.",
