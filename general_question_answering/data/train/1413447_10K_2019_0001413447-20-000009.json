The four end-markets are Automotive, Industrial & IoT, Mobile, and Communication Infrastructure & Others.\nAutomotive\nIndustrial & IoT\nMobile\nComm Infra & Others\nKey Applications\nADAS/Radar\nConnected Infotainment\nVehicle Networks\nElectrification\nSecure Car Access\neCockpit\nBody Comfort & Convenience\nPowertrain\nFactory and Building Automation\nSmart Home and Building Control\nHome Entertainment\nPower and Energy\nMedical\nSmart Retail\nSmart Appliances\nSmartphones\nWearables\nTablets\nMobile Accessories\nWireless Basestations\nEnterprise Data Center Network & Security\nWired and Wireless Service Provider Infrastructure\nBanking Cards eGovernment\nTransit Cards\nRFID Tagging\nGrowth Drivers\nVehicle electrification and automation\nGovernment requirements & consumer demands for increased safety, reliability, comfort and efficiency\nIncrease need of security across all applications\nShift from mechanical to electronic equipment\nIncreasing processing and connectivity\nIncreasing use of low-power nodes\nEnergy efficiency\nPredictive maintenance Automation\nMachine Learning\nMobile Wallet/Mobile Transit\nCustom Interface/Power solutions\n5G development/Massive MiMo and mmwave\nIncreasing demand for bandwidth, cloud computing\nIoT\ni.\nAutomotive\nGrowth in automotive semiconductor sales relies on global vehicle sales and production trends and the increase in semiconductor content per vehicle, which is being driven by the proliferation of electronic features throughout the vehicle.\nTwo mega-trends will drive the semiconductor content increase in the future: Electrification and autonomy. The path to full autonomy is driving the increase of driver assistance systems in the car already today. In the same way, tight emissions regulations are accelerating the penetration of electrification.\nSemiconductor content per vehicle continues to increase due to government regulation of safety and emissions, standardization of higher-end options across a greater number of vehicle classes as well as consumer demand for greater fuel efficiency, advanced safety, multimedia applications and connectivity. Automotive safety features are evolving from passive safety systems to active safety systems with Advanced Driving Assisted Systems (ADAS) such as radar and vision systems. Semiconductor content is also increasing in engine management and fuel economy applications, like Battery Management Systems (BMS). Comfort and convenience systems and user interface applications, such as a digital cockpit with multiple large interactive screens, are also areas with high semiconductor content increases. In addition, the use of networking in automotive applications continues to increase as various subsystems communicate within the automobile and with external devices and networks. Smart car access and automotive Near-Field Communication (NFC) are gaining ground in automotive as well, enabling the connection of vehicles and car keys to portable devices and the infrastructure. Data integrity and security hardware features for safeguarding memory, communication and system data are also increasing in importance.\nDue to the high degree of regulatory scrutiny and safety requirements, the automotive semiconductor market is characterized by stringent qualification processes, zero defect quality processes, functionally safe design architecture, high reliability, extensive design-in timeframes and long product life cycles which results in significant barriers to entry.\nii.\nIndustrial & IoT\nThe world is becoming smarter, more connected and more data driven, and the Industrial & IoT market sits at the center of this global digital transformation. The Industrial & IoT market is highly fragmented with a diverse collection of products and applications such as factory automation, power and energy, medical electronics, smart retail, smart home, smart appliances and home entertainment.\nGrowth in the Industrial market is driven by the replacement of traditional mechanical equipment by smart and connected electronic equipment using various sensors, processors, connectivity and security chipsets that align well with NXP\u2019s ability to provide a complete range of processing, connectivity and secure solutions. In IoT, growth is driven by the increasing use of high-performance edge and media devices (e.g. home\nentertainment, connected home assistants, home control and security) and low power IoT nodes (e.g. smart home, hearables, health trackers) where NXP scalable solutions across the entire embedded processing spectrum are ideally suited.\nThe increase in productivity with real-time insights and efficient processes for factory automation, the enhancement in consumer convenience, security and comfort for smart homes, the reduction of resource consumption and better energy efficiency for smart appliances, the increase in performance of rich media content in smart consumer devices and the need for better health prevention and monitoring solutions (wearables, smart patches and smart drug delivery devices) to help ensure the future health of millions of people are some of the key use-cases driving growth in Industrial & IoT.\nFinally, with the growing number of connected devices, latency, privacy and bandwidth become critical limiting factors and Edge computing solves this by bringing the intelligence closer to the source. Security and tamper-detection capabilities are also becoming essential features of these Industrial & IoT solutions.\niii.\nMobile\nMobile includes applications such as smartphones, feature phones, tablets, wearables and mobile accessories. NXP has a strong focus on mobile wallet and specialty custom analog solutions. The demand for faster speeds, improved battery life, fast charging, mobile wallet, mobile transit and authentication is driving increased semiconductor content for NXP. The growth in this market is mainly driven by the increasing attach rate of these features across devices, vendors and regions, from flagship smartphones down to feature phones, from developed countries to emerging regions. The introduction of new technologies and new use-cases around secured connectivity, high-speed interfaces and charging creates additional opportunities for NXP.\niv.\nCommunication Infrastructure & Others\nGrowth in the network communication market is driven by strong demand for digital content, ubiquitous access, security, increased enterprise adoption of advanced video communications and the trend towards an increasingly global and mobile workforce. These factors have driven greater adoption of both mobile and fixed Internet services and smart devices, cloud computing environments, Internet Protocol television and online gaming. With the trend toward increasingly media-rich applications such as video sharing platforms, social networks, high definition (HD) movie downloads, video conferencing, wireless connectivity and enterprise access, Internet traffic is increasing continuously. The growth in data traffic is resulting in service providers, enterprises and consumers demanding an increase in the amount of wireless infrastructure, networking and electronic equipment. Providers of wireless infrastructure, networking and storage equipment are introducing new technologies and products with enhanced performance and functionality while reducing design and manufacturing costs. As more and more data is being exchanged and consumed by billions of connected devices, 5G, the new mobile communication technology, enables very fast data transfer, low latency and reliability. 5G can support services that require immediate and uninterrupted connectivity. More bandwidth and higher frequencies are needed requiring more compute power. More base stations are needed and massive MIMO - which provides better throughput and better spectrum efficiency - will greatly expand the number of antenna\u2019s needed to maximize coverage in combination with small cells densification.\nIn secure identification solutions, the demand for applications requiring the highest security and reliability shifts towards solutions with a contactless RF interface driven by the increasing adoption of contactless ePassports, eID credentials, transportation and payment cards. Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) can be used to identify and authenticate objects and is designed to fulfill the requirements of a wide range of applications across numerous vertical markets. RFID technology is entering new markets, such as interactive gaming and toys, and various applications to track goods through the supply chain and keep track of inventory. In addition, there is an increasing demand for authentication and anti-counterfeit solutions to protect manufacturers and consumers.\nProducts\nWe offer customers a broad portfolio of semiconductor products including microcontrollers, application processors, communication processors, connectivity chipsets, analog and interface devices, RF power amplifiers,\nsecurity controllers and sensors.

Two technologies serve the LNA portfolio, each with distinct advantages for their applications. Wireless infrastructure applications and many general wireless applications are served with III-V technology LNAs. Advanced SiGe technology is utilized in LNAs designed for wireless communication, cellular, consumer, automotive and industrial applications.\nvii.\nSecurity Controllers\nNXP is the market leader in security controller ICs. Our security controller ICs are embedded in smart cards (ePassports, electronic ID credentials, payment cards, transportation cards), as well as in consumer electronic and smart devices, for example in smartphones, tablets and wearables. These security controller ICs are suited for applications demanding the highest security and reliability. Nearly all of our security products consist of multi-functional solutions comprised of passive RF connectivity devices facilitating information transfer from the user document to reader infrastructure; secure, tamper-proof microcontroller devices in which information is securely encrypted (\u201csecure element\u201d); and secure real-time operating system software products to facilitate the encryption-decryption of data, and the interaction with the reader infrastructure systems. Our solutions are developed to provide extreme levels of security of user information, undergoing stringent and continued global governmental and banking certification processes, and to deliver high level of device performance enabling significant throughput and productivity to our customers.\nviii.\nSensors\nSensors serve as a primary interface in embedded systems for advanced human interface and contextual awareness that mimic the human \u201c5 senses\u201d interaction with the external environment. We provide several categories of semiconductor-based environmental and inertial sensors for the Automotive market, including\npressure, inertial, magnetic and gyroscopic sensors that provide orientation detection, gesture recognition, tilt to scroll functionality and position detection.\nManufacturing\nWe manufacture integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors through a combination of wholly owned manufacturing facilities, a manufacturing facility operated jointly with another semiconductor company and third-party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. We manage our manufacturing assets together through one centralized organization to ensure we realize scale benefits in asset utilization, purchasing volumes and overhead leverage across businesses.\nIn the future, we expect to outsource an increased part of our internal demand for wafer foundry and packaging services to third-party manufacturing sources in order to increase our flexibility to accommodate increased demand.\nThe manufacturing of a semiconductor involves several phases of production, which can be broadly divided into \u201cfront-end\u201d and \u201cback-end\u201d processes. Front-end processes take place at highly complex wafer manufacturing facilities (called fabrication plants or \u201cwafer fabs\u201d), and involve the imprinting of substrate silicon wafers with the precise circuitry required for semiconductors to function. The front-end production cycle requires high levels of precision and involves as many as 300 process steps. Back-end processes involve the assembly, test and packaging of semiconductors in a form suitable for distribution. In contrast to the highly complex front-end process, back-end processing is generally less complicated, and as a result we tend to determine the location of our back-end facilities based more on cost factors than on technical considerations.\nWe primarily focus our internal and joint venture wafer manufacturing operations on running proprietary specialty process technologies that enable us to differentiate our products on key performance features, and we generally outsource wafer manufacturing in process technologies that are available at third-party wafer foundries when it is economical to do so. In addition, we increasingly focus our in-house manufacturing on our competitive 8-inch wafer facilities, which predominantly run manufacturing processes in the 140 nanometer, 180 nanometer and 250 nanometer process nodes. This focus increases our return on invested capital and reduces capital expenditures.\nOur front-end manufacturing facilities use a broad range of production processes and proprietary design methods, including complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), bipolar, bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) and double-diffused metal on silicon oxide semiconductor (DMOS) technologies. Our wafer fabs produce semiconductors with line widths ranging from 90 nanometers to 3 microns for integrated circuits and 0.5 microns to greater than 4 microns for discretes. This broad technology portfolio enables us to meet increasing demand from customers for system solutions, which require a variety of technologies.\nOur back-end manufacturing facilities test and package many different types of products using a wide variety of processes. To optimize flexibility, we use shared technology platforms for our back-end assembly operations. Most of our assembly and test activities are maintained in-house.\nThe following table shows selected key information with respect to our major front-end and back-end facilities:\n(1)\tJoint venture with TSMC; we are entitled to 60% of the joint venture\u2019s annual capacity.\nWe use a large number of raw materials in our front- and back-end manufacturing processes, including silicon wafers, chemicals, gases, lead frames, substrates, molding compounds and various types of precious and other metals. Our most important raw materials are the raw, or substrate, silicon wafers we use to make our semiconductors. We purchase these wafers, which must meet exacting specifications, from a limited number of suppliers in the geographic region in which our fabrication facilities are located. At our wholly owned fabrication plants, we use raw wafers ranging from 6 inches to 8 inches in size. Our SSMC wafer fab facility, which produces 8 inch wafers, is jointly owned by TSMC and ourselves. Emerging fabrication technologies employ larger wafer sizes and, accordingly, we expect that our production requirements will in the future shift towards larger substrate wafers.\nWe typically source our other raw materials in a similar fashion as our wafers, although our portfolio of suppliers is more diverse. Some of our suppliers provide us with materials on a just-in-time basis, which permits us to reduce our procurement costs and the negative cash flow consequences of maintaining inventories, but exposes us to potential supply chain interruptions. We purchase most of our raw materials on the basis of fixed price contracts, but generally do not commit ourselves to long-term purchase obligations, which permits us to renegotiate prices periodically.\nSales, Marketing and Customers\nWe market our products and solutions worldwide to a variety of OEMs, Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs), contract manufacturers and distributors. We generate demand for our products by delivering product solutions to our customers, and supporting their system design-in activities by providing application architecture expertise and local field application engineering support.\nOur sales and marketing teams are organized into five regions, which are EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), the Americas, Japan, South Korea and Greater China (including Asia Pacific). These sales regions\nare responsible for managing customer relationships and creating demand for our solutions through the full ecosystem development, including our distributors and at our large number of mass market customers.\nOur sales and marketing strategy focuses on key defined verticals in Automotive, Mobile, Industrial and IoT and Communication Infrastructure, deepening our relationship with our top OEMs and electronic manufacturing service customers, expanding our reach to our mass market customers, startups and our distribution partners and becoming their preferred supplier, which we believe assists us in reducing sales volatility in challenging markets. We have long-standing customer relationships with most of our customers. Our 10 largest OEM end customers, some of whom are supplied by distributors, in alphabetical order, are Apple, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Delphi, Ericsson, Huawei, LG, Samsung and ZTE. We also have a strong position with our distribution partners, including our three largest, Arrow, Avnet and Nexty.\nOur revenue is primarily the sum of our direct sales to OEMs plus our distributors\u2019 resale of NXP products. Avnet accounted for 14% of our revenue in 2019 and 14% in 2018. Arrow accounted for less than 10% of our revenue in 2019 and 10% in 2018. No other distributor accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue. With 11% of total revenue in both 2019 and 2018, Continental was the only OEM to which we had direct sales that accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2019 and 2018.\nSee Note 23 \u201cSegments and Geographical Information\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of total revenue by segment and geographic market for the last three financial years.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. We direct our research and development efforts largely to the development of new semiconductor solutions where we see significant opportunities for growth. We target applications that require stringent overall system and subsystem performance. As new and challenging applications proliferate, we believe that many of these applications will benefit from our solutions. We have assembled a global team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in RF, analog, power management, interface, security and digital processing. As of December 31, 2019, we had 8,808 employees in research and development.\nTo outpace market growth we invest in research and development to extend or create leading market positions, with an emphasis on fast growing sizable market segments, such as ADAS, in-vehicle networks and power management, as well as Edge computing to support the successful deployment in the IoT with our cross-over processing technology, but also in emerging markets, such as massive MIMO in RF Power and mmWave for 5G. In addition, we invest a few percent of our total research and development expenditures in research activities that develop fundamental new technologies or product categories that could contribute significantly to our company growth in the future.\nWe annually perform a fundamental review of our business portfolio and our related new product and technology development opportunities in order to decide on changes in the allocation of our research and development resources. For products targeting established markets, we evaluate our research and development expenditures based on clear business need and risk assessments. For break-through technologies and new market opportunities, we look at the strategic fit and synergies with the rest of our portfolio and the size of the potential addressable market. Overall, we allocate our research and development to maintain a healthy mix of emerging growth and mature businesses.\nIntellectual Property\nThe creation and use of intellectual property is a key aspect of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents, trademarks, domain names, retaining trade secrets and defending, enforcing and utilizing our intellectual property rights, where appropriate. We believe this strategy allows us to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies, and helps us to improve the return on our investment in research and development. We have a broad portfolio of close to 10,000 patent families (each patent family includes all patents and patent applications originating from the same\ninvention). To protect confidential technical information and software, we rely on copyright and trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements as applicable. In situations where we believe that a third party has infringed on our intellectual property, we enforce our rights through all available legal means to the extent that we determine the benefits of such actions to outweigh the costs and risks involved.\nWe own a number of trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. Where we consider it desirable, we develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection. Our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and end-users.\nWhile our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights constitute valuable assets, we do not view any individual right or asset as material to our operations as a whole. We believe it is the combination of our proprietary technology, patents, know-how and other intellectual property rights and assets that creates an advantage for our business.\nIn addition to obtaining our own patents and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into licensing agreements and other arrangements authorizing us to use intellectual property rights, confidential technical information, software and other technology owned by third parties. We also engage, in certain instances, in licensing and selling of certain of our technology, patents and other intellectual property rights.\nCompetition\nWe compete with many different semiconductor companies, including multinational companies with integrated research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines, \u201cfabless\u201d semiconductor companies, and companies that are focused on a single application market segment or standard product.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks related to our business\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical.\nHistorically, the relationship between supply and demand in the semiconductor industry has caused a high degree of cyclicality in the semiconductor market. Semiconductor supply is partly driven by manufacturing capacity, which in the past has demonstrated alternating periods of substantial capacity additions and periods in which no or limited capacity was added. As a general matter, semiconductor companies are more likely to add\ncapacity in periods when current or expected future demand is strong and margins are, or are expected to be, high. Investments in new capacity can result in overcapacity, which can lead to a reduction in prices and margins. In response, companies typically limit further capacity additions, eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied. In addition, demand for semiconductors varies, which can exacerbate the effect of supply fluctuations. As a result of this cyclicality, the semiconductor industry has in the past experienced significant downturns, such as in 1997/1998, 2001/2002 and in 2008/2009, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing life cycles of semiconductor companies\u2019 products and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminishing demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, under-utilization of manufacturing capacity and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. The foregoing risks have historically had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificantly increased volatility and instability and unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nIn 2008 and 2009, Europe, the United States and international markets experienced increased volatility and instability. In 2015, volatility and instability in financial markets continued following renewed investor concerns related to the economic situation in parts of the world, a decline in the growth rate of the Chinese economy, increased hostilities in the Middle East, and other world events. These, or other events, could further adversely affect the economies of the European Union, the United States and those of other countries and may exacerbate the cyclicality of our business. Among other factors, we face risks attendant to unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal, monetary and trade policies of governments, tax rates and policy and changes in demand for end-user products and changes in interest rates.\nThere is a significant risk that the global economy could fall into recession again. If economic conditions remain uncertain or deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIt is difficult for us, our customers and suppliers to forecast demand trends. We may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future business cycles. A recurrent decline in demand or the failure of demand to return to prior levels could place pressure on our results of operations. The timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive. If we fail to introduce new technologies and products in a timely manner, this could adversely affect our business.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, short product lifecycles, significant price erosion and evolving standards. Accordingly, the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new technologies and products that are ultimately successful in the market. The costs related to the research and development necessary to develop new technologies and products are significant and any reduction of our research and development budget could harm our competitiveness. Meeting evolving industry requirements and introducing new products to the market in a timely manner and at prices that are acceptable to our customers are significant factors in determining our competitiveness and success. Commitments to develop new products must be made well in advance of any resulting sales, and technologies and standards may change during development, potentially rendering our products outdated or uncompetitive before their introduction. If we are unable to successfully develop new products, our revenue may decline substantially. Moreover, some of our competitors are well-established entities, are larger than us and have greater resources than we do. If these competitors increase the resources they devote to developing and marketing their products, we may not be able to compete effectively. Any consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product offerings and financial resources, further strengthening their competitive position. In addition, some of our competitors operate in narrow business areas relative to us, allowing them to concentrate their research and development efforts directly on products and services for those areas, which may give them a competitive advantage. As a result of these competitive pressures, we may face declining sales volumes or lower prevailing prices for our products, and we may not be able to reduce our total\ncosts in line with this declining revenue. If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn many of the market segments in which we compete, we depend on winning selection processes, and failure to be selected could adversely affect our business in those market segments.\nOne of our business strategies is to participate in and win competitive bid selection processes to develop products for use in our customers\u2019 equipment and products. These selection processes can be lengthy and require us to incur significant design and development expenditures, with no guarantee of winning a contract or generating revenue. Failure to win new design projects and delays in developing new products with anticipated technological advances or in commencing volume shipments of these products may have an adverse effect on our business. This risk is particularly pronounced in markets where there are only a few potential customers and in the automotive market, where, due to the longer design cycles involved, failure to win a design-in could prevent access to a customer for several years. Our failure to win a sufficient number of these bids could result in reduced revenue and hurt our competitive position in future selection processes because we may not be perceived as being a technology or industry leader, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for our products depends to a significant degree on the demand for our customers\u2019 end products.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is derived from sales to manufacturers in the automotive, industrial & IoT, mobile, and communication infrastructure. Demand in these markets fluctuates significantly, driven by consumer spending, consumer preferences, the development of new technologies and prevailing economic conditions. In addition, the specific products in which our semiconductors are incorporated may not be successful, or may experience price erosion or other competitive factors that affect the price manufacturers are willing to pay us. Such customers have in the past, and may in the future, vary order levels significantly from period to period, request postponements to scheduled delivery dates, modify their orders or reduce lead times. This is particularly common during periods of low demand. This can make managing our business difficult, as it limits the predictability of future revenue. It can also affect the accuracy of our financial forecasts. Furthermore, developing industry trends, including customers\u2019 use of outsourcing and new and revised supply chain models, may affect our revenue, costs and working capital requirements. Additionally, a significant portion of our products is made to order.\nIf customers do not purchase products made specifically for them, we may not be able to resell such products to other customers or may not be able to require the customers who have ordered these products to pay a cancellation fee. The foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by continued price erosion, especially after a product has been on the market.\nOne of the results of the rapid innovation in the semiconductor industry is that pricing pressure, especially on products containing older technology, can be intense. Product life cycles are relatively short, and as a result, products tend to be replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes on a regular basis.\nIn turn, demand for older technology falls, causing the price at which such products can be sold to drop, in some cases precipitously. In order to continue profitably supplying these products, we must reduce our production costs in line with the lower revenue we can expect to generate per unit. Usually, this must be accomplished through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies. If we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins, we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of these products. Moreover, we may not be able to cease production of such products, either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons, and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products. We cannot guarantee that competition in our core product markets will not lead to price erosion, lower revenue or lower margins in the future. Should reductions in our manufacturing costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition. As a result of our acquisition of Marvell\u2019s Wireless WiFi Connectivity Business Unit, Bluetooth technology portfolio and related assets in 2019, we recognized goodwill of $1.1 billion and intangible assets of $0.5 billion. As a result of our acquisition of Freescale in 2015, we recognized goodwill of $7.4 billion and intangible assets of $8.5 billion. We review our goodwill and other intangible assets balance for impairment upon any indication of a potential impairment, and in the case of goodwill, at a minimum of once a year. Impairment may result from, among other things, a sustained decrease in share price, deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products and services we sell, challenges to the validity of certain registered intellectual property, reduced sales of certain products incorporating intellectual property and a variety of other factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations. Depending on future circumstances, it is possible that we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Any future determination of impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAs our business is global, we need to comply with laws and regulations in countries across the world and are exposed to international business risks that could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate globally, with manufacturing, assembly and testing facilities in several continents, and we market our products globally.\nAs a result, we are subject to environmental, labor and health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We are also required to obtain environmental permits and other authorizations or licenses from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. In the jurisdictions where we operate, we need to comply with differing standards and varying practices of regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative bodies.\nIn addition, the business environment is also subject to many economic and political uncertainties, including the following international business risks:\n\u2022\nnegative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments and international trade arrangements, such as the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the sovereign debt crisis in certain European countries and the increase of barriers to international trade, such as the recent imposition of tariffs on imports by the United States and China;\n\u2022\nsocial and political instability in a number of countries around the world, including continued hostilities and civil unrest in the Middle East. The instability may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operations via our customers and volatility in energy prices and the financial markets;\n\u2022\npotential terrorist attacks;\n\u2022\nepidemics and pandemics, such as the recent coronavirus outbreak, which may adversely affect our workforce, as well as our suppliers and customers, in particular in Asia;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in governmental policies, especially those affecting trade and investment;\n\u2022\nour customers or other groups of stakeholders might impose requirements that are more stringent than the laws in the countries in which we are active;\n\u2022\nvolatility in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular with respect to the U.S. dollar, and transfer restrictions, in particular in China; and\n\u2022\nthreats that our operations or property could be subject to nationalization and expropriation.\nNo assurance can be given that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with the laws and regulations to which we are subject or that we have obtained or will obtain the permits and other authorizations or licenses that we need. If we violate or fail to comply with laws, regulations, permits and other authorizations or licenses, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Furthermore, if one or more of our customers are sanctioned by regulators for non-compliance with laws and regulations, we could experience a decrease in demand for our products. For example, import and export regulations, such as the U.S.\nExport Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, are complex, change frequently, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current U.S. administration. If our customers or suppliers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend activities with these customers or suppliers, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In this case, or if any of the international business risks were to materialize or become worse, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, further increasing legal and financial compliance costs. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure.\nInterruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology applications, systems and networks to operate our business. The reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and software, and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs is critical to our business. Any significant interruption in our business applications, systems or networks, including but not limited to new system implementations, computer viruses, cyberattacks, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur computer systems and networks are subject to attempted security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents, which, if successful, could impact our business.\nWe have, from time to time, experienced cyber-attacks attempting to obtain access to our computer systems and networks. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in the misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology, the compromise of personal and confidential information of our employees, customers or suppliers or interrupt our business. For instance, in January 2020, we became aware of a compromise of certain of our systems. We are taking steps to identify the malicious activity and are implementing remedial measures to increase the security of our systems and networks to respond to evolving threats and new information. As of the date of this filing, we do not believe that this IT system compromise has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or any material damage to us. However, the investigation is ongoing, and we are continuing to evaluate the amount and type of data compromised. There can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future. In the current environment, there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems, and those of customers, suppliers, and some of those attempts may be successful. Such breaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our, our customer, or other third party data or systems, theft of sensitive or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, system disruptions, and denial of service. In the event of such breaches, we, our customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. As these threats continue to develop and grow, we have been adapting our security measures and we continue to increase the amount we allocate to implement, maintain and/or update security systems to protect data and infrastructure. As a global enterprise, we could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection. Additionally, cyber-attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to us, our customers, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, potential liability, and damage our reputation and affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers.\nIn addition, we may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\nIn difficult market conditions, our high fixed costs combined with low revenue may negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs and, notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In less favorable industry environments, like we faced in the second half in 2011, we are generally faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products. During such periods, our fabrication plants could operate at lower loading level, while the fixed costs associated with the full capacity continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.\nThe semiconductor industry is capital intensive and if we are unable to invest the necessary capital to operate and grow our business, we may not remain competitive.\nTo remain competitive, we must constantly improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development, all of which requires investment of significant amounts of capital. This risk is magnified by the indebtedness we currently have, since we are required to use a portion of our cash flow to service that debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise sufficient capital to meet both our debt service and capital investment requirements, or if we are unable to raise required capital on favorable terms when needed, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely to a significant extent on proprietary intellectual property. We may not be able to protect this intellectual property against improper use by our competitors or others.\nOur success and future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, our products, our proprietary designs and fabrication processes, and other intellectual property against misappropriation by others. We primarily rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our intellectual property. We may have difficulty obtaining patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary products, technology and intellectual property, and the patents and other intellectual property rights we receive may be insufficient to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantage. We may not obtain patent protection or secure other intellectual property rights in all the countries in which we operate, and under the laws of such countries, patents and other intellectual property rights may be or become unavailable or limited in scope. Even if new patents are issued, the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, any of our existing patents, and any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. The protection offered by intellectual property rights may be inadequate or weakened for reasons or circumstances that are out of our control. Further, our proprietary technology, designs and processes and other intellectual property may be vulnerable to disclosure or misappropriation by employees, contractors and other persons. It is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our proprietary technologies, our products, designs, processes and other intellectual property despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property. While we hold a significant number of patents, there can be no assurances that additional patents will be issued or that any rights granted under our patents will provide meaningful protection against misappropriation of our intellectual property. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. We may not have or pursue patents or pending applications in all the countries in which we operate corresponding to all of our primary patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, effective enforcement in some countries may not be available. In particular, intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in countries where the application and enforcement of the laws governing such rights may not have reached the same level as compared to other jurisdictions where we operate. Consequently, operating in some countries may\nsubject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our suppliers or other parties with whom we engage. There is no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights or have adequate legal recourse in the event that we seek legal or judicial enforcement of our intellectual property rights under the laws of such countries. Any inability on our part to adequately protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become party to intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs, pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.\nWe have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, communications alleging possible infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of others. Further, we may become involved in costly litigation brought against us regarding patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot obtain or take the view that we don\u2019t need a license, these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages (and potentially treble damages in the United States) or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted. Such lawsuits, if successful, could result in an increase in the costs of selling certain of our products, our having to partially or completely redesign our products or stop the sale of some of our products and could cause damage to our reputation. Any litigation could require significant financial and management resources regardless of the merits or outcome, and we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any litigation or that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products, could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may rely on strategic partnerships, joint ventures and alliances for manufacturing and research and development. However, we often do not control these partnerships and joint ventures, and actions taken by any of our partners or the termination of these partnerships or joint ventures could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our strategy, we have historically entered into a number of long-term strategic partnerships with other leading industry participants, and may do so again in the future. For example, we currently participate in a joint venture with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (\u201cTSMC\u201d) called Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company Pte. Ltd. (\u201cSSMC\u201d).\nIf any of our strategic partners in alliances we currently engage with or may engage with in the future were to encounter financial difficulties or change their business strategies, they may no longer be able or willing to participate in these groups or alliances, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under the terms of current or future alliances, we may have certain obligations, including funding obligations or take or pay obligations. For example, we have made certain commitments to SSMC, in which we have a 61.2% ownership share, whereby we are obligated to make cash payments to SSMC should we fail to utilize, and TSMC does not utilize, an agreed upon percentage of the total available capacity at SSMC\u2019s fabrication facilities if overall SSMC utilization levels drop below a fixed proportion of the total available capacity.\nWe may from time to time desire to exit certain product lines or businesses, or to restructure our operations, but may not be successful in doing so.\nFrom time to time, we may decide to divest certain product lines and businesses or restructure our operations, including through the contribution of assets to joint ventures. We have, in recent years, exited several of our product lines and businesses, and we have closed several of our manufacturing and research facilities. We may continue to do so in the future. However, our ability to successfully exit product lines and businesses, or to close or consolidate operations, depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For example, if we are seeking a buyer for a particular business line, none may be available, or we may not be successful in negotiating satisfactory terms with prospective buyers. In addition, we may face internal obstacles\nto our efforts. In particular, several of our operations and facilities are subject to collective bargaining agreements and social plans or require us to consult with our employee representatives, such as work councils, which may prevent or complicate our efforts to sell or restructure our businesses. In some cases, particularly with respect to our European operations, there may be laws or other legal impediments affecting our ability to carry out such sales or restructuring.\nIf we are unable to exit a product line or business in a timely manner, or to restructure our operations in a manner we deem to be advantageous, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if a divestment is successful, we may face indemnity and other liability claims by the acquirer or other parties.\nWe may from time to time restructure parts of our organization. Any such restructuring may impact customer satisfaction and the costs of implementation may be difficult to predict.\nBetween 2008 and 2011, we executed a redesign program and, in 2013 we executed a restructuring initiative designed to improve operational efficiency and to competitively position the company for sustainable growth. In 2015, we began a restructuring initiative to prepare for and implement the integration of Freescale into our existing businesses. We plan to continue to restructure and make changes to parts of the processes in our organization. Furthermore, if the global economy remains volatile or if the global economy reenters a recession, our revenues could decline, and we may be forced to take additional cost savings steps that could result in additional charges and materially affect our business. The costs of implementing any restructurings, changes or cost savings steps may differ from our estimates and any negative impacts on our revenues or otherwise of such restructurings, changes or steps, such as situations in which customer satisfaction is negatively impacted, may be larger than originally estimated.\nIf we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, if regular or statutory consultation processes with employee representatives such as works councils fail or are delayed, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe are a party to collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions. We are also required to consult with our employee representatives, such as works councils, on items such as restructurings, acquisitions and divestitures. Although we believe that our relations with our employees, employee representatives and unions are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate these agreements as they expire from time to time or to conclude the consultation processes in a timely and favorable way. The impact of future negotiations and consultation processes with employee representatives could have a material impact on our financial results. Also, if we fail to extend or renegotiate our labor agreements and social plans, if significant disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage, we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to predict.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to predict and may fluctuate. The comparatively long period between the time at which we commence development of a product and the time at which it may be delivered to a customer leads to high inventory and work-in-progress levels. The volatility of our customers\u2019 own businesses and the time required to manufacture products also makes it difficult to manage inventory levels and requires us to stockpile products across many different specifications.\nOur business may be adversely affected by costs relating to product defects, and we could be faced with product liability and warranty claims.\nWe make highly complex electronic components and, accordingly, there is a risk that defects may occur in any of our products. Such defects can give rise to significant costs, including expenses relating to recalling products, replacing defective items, writing down defective inventory and loss of potential sales. In addition, the occurrence of such defects may give rise to product liability and warranty claims, including liability for damages caused by such defects. If we release defective products into the market, our reputation could suffer and we may lose sales opportunities and incur liability for damages. Moreover, since the cost of replacing defective\nsemiconductor devices is often much higher than the value of the devices themselves, we may at times face damage claims from customers in excess of the amounts they pay us for our products, including consequential damages. We also face exposure to potential liability resulting from the fact that our customers typically integrate the semiconductors we sell into numerous consumer products, which are then sold into the marketplace. We are exposed to product liability claims if our semiconductors or the consumer products based on them malfunction and result in personal injury or death. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses relating to attorneys\u2019 fees and damages. In addition, our customers may recall their products if they prove to be defective or make compensatory payments in accordance with industry or business practice or in order to maintain good customer relationships. If such a recall or payment is caused by a defect in one of our products, our customers may seek to recover all or a portion of their losses from us. If any of these risks materialize, our reputation would be harmed and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has suffered, and could in the future suffer, from manufacturing problems.\nWe manufacture, in our own factories as well as with third parties, our products using processes that are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must continuously be modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and, as a result of such problems, we may on occasion not be able to deliver products or do so in a timely or cost-effective or competitive manner. As the complexity of both our products and our fabrication processes has become more advanced, manufacturing tolerances have been reduced and requirements for precision have become more demanding. As is common in the semiconductor industry, we have in the past experienced manufacturing difficulties that have given rise to delays in delivery and quality control problems. There can be no assurance that any such occurrence in the future would not materially harm our results of operations. Further, we may suffer disruptions in our manufacturing operations, either due to production difficulties such as those described above or as a result of external factors beyond our control. We may, in the future, experience manufacturing difficulties or permanent or temporary loss of manufacturing capacity due to the preceding or other risks. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the timely supply of equipment and materials and could suffer if suppliers fail to meet their delivery obligations or raise prices. Certain equipment and materials needed in our manufacturing operations are only available from a limited number of suppliers.\nOur manufacturing operations depend on deliveries of equipment and materials in a timely manner and, in some cases, on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Supply disruptions may also occur due to shortages in critical materials, such as silicon wafers or specialized chemicals. Because the equipment that we purchase is complex, it is frequently difficult or impossible for us to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of quality equipment or materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of equipment or materials.\nFailure of our third party suppliers to perform could adversely affect our ability to exploit growth opportunities.\nWe currently use outside suppliers for a portion of our manufacturing capacity. Outsourcing our production presents a number of risks. If our outside suppliers are unable to satisfy our demand, or experience manufacturing difficulties, delays or reduced yields, our results of operations and ability to satisfy customer demand could suffer. In addition, purchasing rather than manufacturing these products may adversely affect our gross profit margin if the purchase costs of these products are higher than our own manufacturing costs would have been. Prices for foundry products also vary depending on capacity utilization rates at our suppliers, quantities demanded, product technology and geometry. Furthermore, these outsourcing costs can vary materially from quarter to quarter and, in cases of industry shortages, they can increase significantly, negatively affecting our gross profit.\nLoss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract such management and other personnel, could affect our business.\nWe depend on our key management to run our business and on our senior engineers to develop new products and technologies. Our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals. Although we have several share based compensation plans in place, we cannot be sure that these plans will help us in our ability to retain key personnel, especially considering that the stock options under some of our plans become exercisable upon a change of control (in particular, when a third party, or third parties acting in concert, obtains, whether directly or indirectly, control of us). The loss of any of our key personnel, whether due to departures, death, ill health or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The market for qualified employees, including skilled engineers and other individuals with the required technical expertise to succeed in our business, is highly competitive and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate the additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities or develop marketable products. The foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDisruptions in our relationships with any one of our key customers could adversely affect our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our top customers, including our distributors. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate similar levels of revenue from our largest customers in the future. If one or more of these customers substantially reduce their purchases from us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe receive subsidies and grants in certain countries, and a reduction in the amount of governmental funding available to us or demands for repayment could increase our costs and affect our results of operations.\nAs is the case with other large semiconductor companies, we receive subsidies and grants from governments in some countries. These programs are subject to periodic review by the relevant governments, and if any of these programs are curtailed or discontinued, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As the availability of government funding is outside our control, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to benefit from government support or that sufficient alternative funding will be available if we lose such support. Moreover, if we terminate any activities or operations, including strategic alliances or joint ventures, we may face adverse actions from the local governmental agencies providing such subsidies to us. In particular, such government agencies could seek to recover such subsidies from us and they could cancel or reduce other subsidies we receive from them. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending in various jurisdictions. Due to the uncertainty inherent in litigation, it is difficult to predict the final outcome. An adverse outcome might affect our results of operations.\nWe and certain of our businesses are involved as plaintiffs or defendants in legal proceedings in various matters. For example, we are involved in legal proceedings claiming personal injuries to the children of former employees as a result of employees\u2019 alleged exposure to chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments operated by us or our former parent companies, Philips and Motorola. Furthermore, because we continue to utilize these clean rooms, we may become subject to future claims alleging personal injury that may lead to additional liability. A judgment against us or material defense cost could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and other non-insured risks, which may have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe are a global company and, as a direct consequence, movements in the financial markets may impact our financial results. We are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including currency fluctuations, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, commodity price risk and credit risk and other non-insured risks. We have euro-denominated assets and liabilities and, since our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, the impact of currency translation adjustments to such assets and liabilities may have a negative effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity. We continue to hold or convert a part of our cash in euros as a hedge for euro expenses and euro interest payments. We are\nexposed to fluctuations in exchange rates when we convert U.S. dollars to euro. We enter into diverse financial transactions with several counterparties to mitigate our currency risk. We only use derivative instruments for hedging purposes.\nWe are also a purchaser of certain base metals, precious metals, chemicals and energy used in the manufacturing process of our products, the prices of which can be volatile. Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform upon their agreed payment obligations. Credit risk is present within our trade receivables. Such exposure is reduced through ongoing credit evaluations of the financial conditions of our customers and by adjusting payment terms and credit limits when appropriate. We invest available cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and are in that respect exposed to credit risk with these counterparties. We actively manage concentration risk on a daily basis adhering to a treasury management policy. We seek to limit the financial institutions with which we enter into financial transactions, such as depositing cash, to those with a strong credit rating wherever possible. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of a negative performance of financial markets and demographic trends on our defined benefit pension liabilities and costs cannot be predicted.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans in a number of countries and a significant number of our employees are covered by our defined benefit pension plans. As of December 31, 2019, we had recognized a net accrued benefit liability of $462 million, representing the unfunded benefit obligations of our defined pension plans. The funding status and the liabilities and costs of maintaining these defined benefit pension plans may be impacted by financial market developments. For example, the accounting for such plans requires determining discount rates, expected rates of compensation and expected returns on plan assets, and any changes in these variables can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs. Negative performance of the financial markets could also have a material impact on funding requirements and net periodic pension costs. Our defined benefit pension plans may also be subject to demographic trends. Accordingly, our costs to meet pension liabilities going forward may be significantly higher than they are today, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nFuture changes to Dutch, U.S. and other foreign tax laws could adversely affect us.\nThe European Commission, U.S. Congress and Treasury Department, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations, particularly payments made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the European Union, U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates.\nRecent examples include the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s initiatives to revise profit allocation and nexus rules to allocate more taxing rights to countries where companies have their markets and to establish a minimum tax rate on a global basis. These initiatives include recommendations and proposals that, if enacted in countries in which we and our affiliates do business, could adversely affect us and our affiliates.\nWe are exposed to a number of different tax uncertainties, which could have an impact on our results.\nWe are required to pay taxes in multiple jurisdictions. We determine the taxes we are required to pay based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We may be subject to unfavorable changes in the respective tax laws and regulations to which we are subject. Tax controls, audits, change in controls and changes in tax laws or regulations or the interpretation given to them may expose us to negative tax consequences, including interest payments and potentially penalties. We have issued transfer-pricing directives in the areas of goods, services and financing, which are in accordance with the Guidelines of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As transfer pricing has a cross border effect, the focus of local tax authorities on implemented transfer pricing procedures in a country may have an impact on results in another country.\nTransfer pricing uncertainties can also result from disputes with local tax authorities about transfer pricing of internal deliveries of goods and services or related to financing, acquisitions and divestments, the use of tax credits and permanent establishments, and tax losses carried forward. These uncertainties may have a significant impact on local tax results. We also have various tax assets resulting from acquisitions. Tax assets can also result from the generation of tax losses in certain legal entities. Tax authorities may challenge these tax assets. In addition, the value of the tax assets resulting from tax losses carried forward depends on having sufficient taxable profits in the future.\nAdditionally, in December of 2017, the United States enacted a budget reconciliation act amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d) and, in 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department issued regulations to clarify certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains provisions affecting the tax treatment of both U.S. companies (such as certain of our subsidiaries) and non-U.S. companies that could materially affect us. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes provisions that reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, impose a base erosion minimum tax on income of a U.S. corporation determined without regard to certain otherwise deductible payments made to certain foreign affiliates, impose a global intangible low-income tax on foreign earnings made by U.S. corporations\u2019 foreign subsidiaries, and impose a one-time transition tax on certain historic earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also includes provisions that provide a deduction for certain foreign-derived intangible income. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued temporary and proposed regulations providing guidance on the application of many of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. However, there may continue to be a substantial delay before all such regulations are promulgated and/or finalized, increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the statutory amendments on us. It is also possible that there will be technical corrections legislation proposed with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the effect of which cannot be predicted.\nWe may not be able to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate.\nWe cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future, because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of the Netherlands, the U.S., and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate.\nThere may from time to time exist deficiencies in our internal control systems that could adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our periodic reporting.\nWe are required to establish and periodically assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Despite the compliance procedures that we have adopted to ensure internal control over financial controls, there may from time to time exist deficiencies in our internal control systems that could adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our periodic reporting. Our periodic reporting is the basis of investors\u2019 and other market professionals\u2019 understanding of our businesses. Imperfections in our periodic reporting could create uncertainty regarding the reliability of our results of operations and financial results, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our reputation or share price.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations expose us to liability and compliance with these laws and regulations, and any such liability may adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate, which govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nAs with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property, we face inherent risks of environmental liability at our current and historical manufacturing facilities. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous\nsubstances as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. Certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. While we do not expect that any contamination currently known to us will have a material adverse effect on our business, we cannot assure you that this is the case or that we will not discover new facts or conditions or that environmental laws or the enforcement of such laws will not change such that our liabilities would be increased significantly. In addition, we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. In summary, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, regulated materials, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nScientific examination of, political attention to and rules and regulations on issues surrounding the existence and extent of climate change may result in an increase in the cost of production due to increase in the prices of energy and introduction of energy or carbon tax. A variety of regulatory developments have been introduced that focus on restricting or managing the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Enterprises may need to purchase at higher costs new equipment or raw materials with lower carbon footprints. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur expenses. New materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may become subject to regulation. These developments and further legislation that is likely to be enacted could affect our operations negatively. Changes in environmental regulations could increase our production and operational costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain natural disasters, such as flooding, large earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, may negatively impact our business. There is increasing concern that climate change is occurring and may cause a rising number of natural disasters.\nEnvironmental and other disasters, such as flooding, large earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, or a combination thereof may negatively impact our business. If flooding, a large earthquake, volcanic eruption or other natural disaster were to directly damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay new production and shipments of existing inventory or result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs, all of which would negatively impact our business. Even if our manufacturing facilities are not directly damaged, a large natural disaster may result in disruptions in distribution channels or supply chains and significant increases in the prices of raw materials used for our manufacturing process. For instance, the nuclear incident following the tsunami in Japan in 2011 impacted the supply chains of our customers and suppliers. Furthermore, any disaster affecting our customers (or their respective customers) may significantly negatively impact the demand for our products and our revenues.\nThe impact of any such natural disasters depends on the specific geographic circumstances but could be significant, as some of our factories are located in areas with known earthquake fault zones, flood or storm risks, including but not limited to Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia or Thailand. There is increasing concern that climate change is occurring that may cause a rising number of natural disasters with potentially dramatic effects on human activity. We cannot predict the economic impact, if any, of natural disasters or climate change.\nThe price of our common stock historically has been volatile. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. The market price for our common stock has varied between a high of $129.50 on December 26, 2019 and a low of $71.56 on January 2, 2019 in the twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2019. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section, changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies, or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors, peer companies or suppliers regarding their own performance, or announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, joint marketing relationships or capital commitments, the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability. In the past, following periods of\nmarket volatility, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nWe may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\nThe amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchases may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes-such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments-and because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, and the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our shares of common stock could depress the market price of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock in connection with acquisitions and other investments. The amount of our common stock issued in connection with any such transaction could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.\nOur board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our ordinary shares on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.\nFuture dividends, if any, and their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: management\u2019s views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; earnings levels; contractual restrictions; cash position and overall financial condition; and changes to our business model. The payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law, contractual restrictions and our corporate structure.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and the factors described under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles, reviews or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nOur guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future the data is forecasted. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy, or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nRisks related to our corporate structure\nUnited States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, certain members of our board, our officers and certain experts named herein reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon the U.S. laws.\nIn the absence of an applicable treaty for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters to which the United States and the Netherlands are a party, a judgment obtained against the Company in the courts of the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, including a judgment predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities law or securities laws of any State or territory within the United States, will not be directly enforceable in the Netherlands.\nIn order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent court of the Netherlands; the relevant Netherlands court has discretion to attach such weight to a judgment of the courts of the United States as it deems appropriate; based on case law, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected to recognize and grant permission for enforcement of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States without re-examination or relitigation of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby, provided that (i) the relevant court in the United States had jurisdiction in the matter in accordance with standards which are generally accepted internationally; (ii) the proceedings before that court complied with principles of proper procedure; (iii) recognition and/or enforcement of that judgment does not conflict with the public policy of the Netherlands; and (iv) recognition and/or enforcement of that judgment is not irreconcilable with a decision of a Dutch court rendered between the same parties or with an earlier decision of a foreign court rendered between the same parties in a dispute that is about the same subject matter and that is based on the same cause, provided that earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands.\nBased on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that U.S. investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors, officers or certain experts named herein who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters.\nIn addition, there is doubt as to whether a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors, our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts, respectively.\nWe are a Dutch public company with limited liability. The rights of our stockholders may be different from the rights of stockholders governed by the laws of U.S. jurisdictions.\nWe are a Dutch public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap). Our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of association and by the laws governing companies incorporated in the Netherlands.\nThe rights of stockholders and the responsibilities of members of our board of directors may be different from the rights and obligations of stockholders in companies governed by the laws of U.S. jurisdictions. In the performance of its duties, our board of directors is required by Dutch law to consider the interests of our company, its stockholders, its employees and other stakeholders, in all cases with due observation of the principles of reasonableness and fairness. It is possible that some of these parties will have interests that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. See Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nOur debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount of $7,400 million. Our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business by:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates in the event we have borrowings under our $1,500 million revolving credit facility agreement (the \u201cRCF Agreement\u201d) because loans under the RCF Agreement bear interest at a variable rate;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event default under the indentures governing our notes and agreements governing other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financial for working capital, capital expenditures, restructurings, product development, research and development, debt service requirements, investments, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we may still incur significantly more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above and affect our ability to service and repay our debt.\nIf we do not comply with the covenants in our debt agreements or fail to generate sufficient cash to service and repay our debt, it could adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nThe RCF Agreement and the indentures governing our unsecured notes or any other debt arrangements that we may have require us to comply with various covenants. If there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or future borrowings under the RCF Agreement or other sources may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, and we may be forced\nto reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness or reduce or delay capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and business plan. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nThe rating of our debt by major rating agencies may further improve or deteriorate, which could affect our additional borrowing capacity and financing costs.\nThe major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt. These ratings are based on current information furnished to the ratings agencies by us and information obtained by the ratings agencies from other sources. An explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect our market value and/or increase our corporate borrowing costs.",

In October 2018, the board of directors of NXP increased the repurchase authorization under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program up to a maximum of 20% of issued share capital (approximately 69 million shares). The 2018 Share Repurchase Program was completed in July 2019, and a total of 69 million shares were repurchased under this program. In November 2019, the Board, as authorized by the 2019 annual general meeting of shareholders, authorized the repurchase of $2 billion of shares (the \u201c2019 Share Repurchase Program\u201d). In addition, the Board approved the purchase of shares from participants in the Company's equity programs who trade shares as trade for tax. This authorization will remain in effect until terminated by the Board. During the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2019, NXP repurchased no shares under the 2019 Share Repurchase Program. Under Dutch tax law, the repurchase of a company\u2019s shares by an entity domiciled in the Netherlands results in a taxable event. The tax on the repurchased shares is attributed to the shareholders, with NXP making the payment on the shareholders\u2019 behalf. As such, the tax on the repurchased shares is accounted for within stockholders\u2019 equity. The following table provides a summary of shares repurchased by the Company in 2019:\n(1)\nReflects shares surrendered by participants to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the Company's equity programs.\nCompany Performance\nThe following graph shows a comparison, since December 31, 2014 of cumulative total return for NXP, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.

MD&A is organized as follows:\n\u2022\nOverview - Overall analysis of financial and other highlights to provide context for the MD&A\n\u2022\nResults of Operations - An analysis of our financial results\n\u2022\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - An analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows and a discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity\n\u2022\nCritical Accounting Estimates - Accounting estimates that management believes are the most important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our financial results and forecasts\n\u2022\nUse of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures - A discussion of the non-GAAP measures used\nEffective January 1, 2019, NXP removed the reference to HPMS in its organizational structure in acknowledgment of the one reportable segment representing the entity as a whole. Our segment represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segment.\nOverview\nRevenue for 2019 was down 5.6% from 2018 against a very challenging semiconductor industry backdrop. Revenues decreased by 7% in our largest end market, Automotive, and 12% in our Industrial and IOT end market which were slightly offset by an increase of 5% in the Communications & Infrastructure end market and a 2% increase in the Mobile end market. When aggregating all end markets, the decrease in revenue was mostly related to lower sales to distributors due to lower end customer demand, in particular in Greater China (including Asia Pacific).\nNotwithstanding the challenging operating environment, we continue to successfully execute our strategy within our target markets and focus on driving profitability. Our gross profit percentage for 2019 increased from 51.6% to 52.0%, due to a slightly more favorable end-market and customer mix and also due to the benefit of certain manufacturing cost controls.\nNXP\u2019s fourth quarter revenue of $2,301 million increased 1.6% sequentially from the third quarter of 2019. This was driven primarily by an increase of 5% in the Automotive end-market and a 3% increase in the mobile end-market, these increases were offset by a 3% decline in each of the other two end markets. We continue to believe that the demand trends within our end markets are beginning to improve.\nOver the course of 2019, we significantly enhanced our product portfolio. At the end of the year, we announced the completion of the acquisition of the Marvell wireless connectivity assets and with that introduced new product solutions. Our customers have already begun to adopt many of the new solutions which we anticipate will help to underpin NXP's long-term growth.\nWe continue to generate strong operating cash flows, with $2,373 million in cash flows from operations for 2019. We returned $1,762 million to our shareholders during the year in dividends and repurchases of common stock. On August 29, 2019, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend by $0.125, or 50%, to $0.375 per common share. Our cash position at the end of 2019 was $1,045 million. On November 19, 2019, the NXP Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.375 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2019.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the composition of operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year-ended December 31, 2019 was $8,877 million compared to $9,407 million for the year-ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $530 million or 5.6%. As of January 1, 2019, income and expenses derived from manufacturing service arrangements (\u201cMSA\u201d) and transitional service arrangements (\u201cTSA\u201d) that are put into\nplace when we divest a business or activity, are included in other income (expense). In 2018, revenue related to these divested activities was $136 million The remaining decrease is essentially related to lower sales in our Automotive and in our Industrial & IOT end markets, which were in particular impacted by the trade tensions between the United States and China.\nRevenue by end-market was as follows:\nRevenue by sales channel was as follows:\nRevenue by geographic region, which is based on the customer\u2019s shipped-to location (except for intellectual property license revenue which is attributable to the Netherlands) was as follows:\nThe decrease in revenue in the Automotive end market of $295 million is the result of a decline in volumes in all of the related product groups. The weakness was primarily driven by Greater China (including Asia Pacific), through lower demand from both our distributors and OEM customers as a result of lower vehicle production and lower vehicle sales, but weakness was also seen in EMEA and the Americas.\nThe decrease in revenue in the Industrial & IoT end market of $214 million was essentially associated with our Microcontrollers product group with a decrease in distributor sales, primarily in Greater China (including Asia Pacific).\nThe net increase in revenue of $27 million in the Mobile end market was mostly driven by the strong adoption of our secure mobile wallet solutions with key OEMs, offset by declines in our semi-custom mobile analog interface products through our distribution channel and both within the Greater China (including Asia Pacific) region.\nThe increase of $88 million in the Communication Infrastructure & Other end market was related to robust growth in RF products in Greater China (including Asia Pacific) due to the adoption of the company\u2019s massive-MIMO (\u201cmMIMO\u201d) solutions for the cellular basestation market, as mobile carriers began to increase network densification efforts ahead of future 5G cellular deployments but partly offset by a reduction in the company\u2019s secure bank card and e-government product groups in Greater China (including Asia Pacific) as well as in Europe.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year-ended December 31, 2019 was $4,618 million, or 52.0% of revenue, compared to $4,851 million, or 51.6% of revenue, for the year-ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $233 million was primarily driven by lower revenue resulting from lower demand. The gross margin percentage increased from 51.6% to 52.0%, due to a slightly more favorable end-market and customer mix and also due to the benefit of certain manufacturing cost controls.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year-ended December 31, 2019 totaled $4,002 million, or 45.1% of revenue, compared to $4,142 million, or 44% of revenue, for the year-ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following table below presents the composition of operating expenses by line item in the statement of operations.\nThe decrease in operating expenses was a result of the following items:\nResearch and development (R&D) costs primarily consist of engineer salaries and wages (including share based compensation and other variable compensation), engineering related costs (including outside services, fixed-asset, IP and other licenses related costs), shared service center costs and other pre-production related expenses.\n\u2022R&D costs for the year-ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $57 million, or 3.4%, when compared to last year driven by:\n- lower variable compensation costs;\n- lower costs associated with the Qualcomm transaction;\n+ higher restructuring costs; and\n+ share-based compensation expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs primarily consist of personnel salaries and wages (including share based compensation and other variable compensation), communication and IT related costs, fixed-asset related costs and sales and marketing costs (including travel expenses).\n\u2022SG&A costs for the year-ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $69 million, or 6.9%, when compared to last year mainly due to:\n- lower salaries;\n- lower variable compensation costs;\n- lower costs associated with the Qualcomm transaction;\n- reductions in information technology expenditures as well as in professional services; and\n+ higher share-based compensation expenses driven by the equity reboot grant to executives in 2018.\n\u2022Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets slightly decreased by $14 million, or 1.0%, when compared to last year driven by:\n- certain intangibles became fully amortized during 2019; and\n+ the start of amortization of intangible assets related to the Wifi Marvell acquisition.\nOther Income (Expense)\nAs of January 1, 2019, income and expenses derived from manufacturing service arrangements (\u201cMSA\u201d) and transitional service arrangements (\u201cTSA\u201d) that are put into place when we divest a business or activity, are included in other income (expense). These arrangements are short-term in nature and are expected to decrease as the divested business or activity becomes more established.\nThe following table presents the split of other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nOther income (expense) reflects income of $25 million for 2019, compared to $2,001 million of income in 2018. Included in 2019 is $20 million relating to the sale of assets, whereas the 2018 amount included the $2 billion termination compensation received from Qualcomm.\nFinancial Income (Expense)\nFinancial income (expense) was an expense of $350 million in 2019, compared to an expense of $335 million in 2018. The change in financial income (expense) is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expenses, net of $88 million, as a result of higher debt levels throughout 2019, partially offset by lower debt extinguishment costs in 2019 versus 2018 of $15 million and the absence of the one time charge ($60 million) on certain financial instruments for compensation related to an adjustment event required by the termination of the Qualcomm transaction in 2018.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $20 million for the year-ended December 31, 2019, which reflects an effective tax rate of 6.9% compared to an expense of $176 million (7.4%) for the year-ended December 31, 2018.\nThe effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives, a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the Netherlands statutory tax rate, adjustments of prior years' income taxes, change in valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses. The impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods, with the significant drivers outlined below:\n\u2022\nThe Company benefits from certain tax incentives, which reduce the effective tax rate in a relative location. The dollar amount of the incentive in any given year is commensurate with the taxable income in that same period. For 2019, the Netherlands tax incentives was lower than 2018, mainly due to the fact that NXP had received a break-up fee from Qualcomm of $2 billion in 2018 which drove a higher income before tax in 2018.\n\u2022\nThe adjustments to prior years\u2019 income taxes was higher in 2018 as a result of the agreement NXP reached with the Dutch tax authorities relative to the application of the Dutch innovation box regime to the taxable income attributable to the Netherlands. This agreement is effective from January 1, 2017. As such, the Company was able to refine its estimate of the Dutch tax liability, recognizing an additional income tax benefit of $67 million in 2018.\n\u2022\nThe increase in the valuation allowance is mainly due to new Dutch corporate income tax law applicable as from 2019. A portion of the interest expenses is non-deductible in the year it is recorded but can be carried forward without expiration.\n\u2022\nThe higher other differences in 2018 relate primarily to a tax benefit on the liquidation of a former investment of $45 million.\nOn a go-forward basis, cash payments for corporate income taxes that are relative to our on-going operations are expected at $45 - $50 million per quarter during 2020. Our future cash payments for income taxes will also be impacted by non-recurring events, resulting in additional payments of $125 million in total, which will be paid in 2020.\nResults Relating to Equity-accounted Investees\nResults relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a gain of $1 million in 2019, whereas in 2018, results relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a gain of $59 million, which includes a net gain realized of $51 million resulting from the sale of ASEN in July 2018.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are related to the third-party share in the results of consolidated companies, predominantly SSMC. Their share of non-controlling interests amounted to a profit of $29 million for the year-ended December 31, 2019, compared to a profit of $50 million for the year-ended December 31, 2018.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations. We continue to generate strong positive operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2019, our cash balance was $1,045 million, a decrease of $1,744 million compared to December 31, 2018 ($2,789 million). Taking into account the available undrawn amount of the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the \u201cRCF Agreement\u201d) of $1,500 million, we had access to $2,545 million of liquidity as of December 31, 2019.\nWe currently use cash to fund operations, meet working capital requirements, for capital expenditures and for potential common stock repurchases, dividends and strategic investments. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our current available sources of funds (including cash and cash equivalents, RCF Agreement, plus anticipated cash generated from operations) will be adequate to finance our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and potential dividends for at least the next year. Our capital expenditures were $526 million in 2019, compared to $611 million in 2018.\nThe common stock repurchase activity was as follows:\nEffective July 26, 2018, the board of directors of NXP, as authorized by its annual general meeting of shareholders (the \u201cAGM\u201d), authorized the repurchase of $5 billion of the Company\u2019s stock period of 18 months. In October 2018, the board of directors of NXP authorized the additional repurchase of shares up to a maximum of 20% (approximately 69 million shares) of the number of shares issued. As of year-end 2018, NXP repurchased 54.4 million shares, for a total of approximately $5 billion, of which a number of 17,300,143 shares had been cancelled. Effective June 17, 2019, the board of directors of NXP, as authorized by its annual general meeting of shareholders (the \u201cAGM\u201d), renewed and revised this authorization for a period of 18 months to repurchase ordinary shares up to the statutory limit. During the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2019 NXP repurchased 15.9 million shares, for a total of approximately $1.4 billion, of which a number of 13.2 million shares had been cancelled. Under Dutch tax law, the repurchase of a company\u2019s shares by an entity domiciled in the Netherlands results in a taxable event. The tax on the repurchased shares is attributed to the shareholders, with NXP making the payment on the shareholders\u2019 behalf. As such, the tax on the repurchased shares is accounted for within stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOn November 27, 2019, the Company, as authorized by the June 2019 AGM, canceled approximately 4% (representing 13,183,081 shares) of the issued number of NXP shares. As a result, the number of issued NXP shares as per November 27, 2019 is 315,519,638 shares.\nOn September 10, 2018, NXP announced the initiation of a Quarterly Dividend Program under which the Company intends to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend. Accordingly, interim dividends of $0.25 per ordinary share were paid on March 15, 2019 and June 13, 2019, and dividends of $0.375 per ordinary share were paid on October 4, 2019 and January 6, 2020.\nOur total debt amounted to $7,365 million as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $11 million compared to December 31, 2018 ($7,354 million). On December 2, 2019, NXP retired the $1.15 billion outstanding principal amount of the 1.0% Cash Convertible Senior Notes at maturity.\nAt December 31, 2019, our cash balance was $1,045 million, of which $188 million was held by SSMC, our consolidated joint venture company with TSMC. Under the terms of our joint venture agreement with TSMC, a portion of this cash can be distributed by way of a dividend to us, but 38.8% of the dividend will be paid to our joint venture partner. There was no dividend declared in 2019 (in 2018, a dividend of $139 million has been paid by SSMC).\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to arrange for new debt and equity financing to fund the transaction. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or we may not have enough capacity under the RCF Agreement, or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including the RCF Agreement, the unsecured notes or\nto fund our other liquidity needs, including working capital and capital expenditure requirements. In any such case, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2019 our operating activities provided $2,373 million in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $272 million, adjustments to reconcile the net income of $2,261 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of ($160) million. Adjustments to net income includes offsetting non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $2,047 million, share-based compensation of $346 million, amortization of the discount on debt and debt issuance costs of $53 million, a gain on sale of assets of ($20) million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11 million, results relating to equity-accounted investees of ($1) million and changes in deferred taxes of ($175) million.\nThe change in operating assets and liabilities (working capital accounts) was attributable to the following:\nThe $116 million decrease in receivables and other current assets was primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable, net, which was driven by the linearity in revenue and the related timing of cash collections in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018.\nThe $128 million decrease in inventories was primarily related to management's efforts to align inventory on hand with the current demand forecasts in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 along with the reclassification of $8 million of inventory related to Voice and Audio Solutions as held for sale, offset by $50 million of inventory that was acquired as part of the acquisition of assets from Marvell.\nThe $460 million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities was primarily related to a decrease in other liabilities resulting from the $197 million payment of an income tax payable related to the Qualcomm break-up fee received in 2018, a decrease of $90 million related to the accrual for variable compensation, a decrease of $76 million related to the accrual for litigation matters, coupled with a decrease of $55 million in accounts payable due to timing in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018.\nThe $43 million decrease in other non-current assets was primarily related to the decrease of $44 million for insurance claims in relation to litigation matters as a result of settlement activity.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2018 our operating activities provided $4,369 million in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $2,258 million, adjustments to reconcile the net income of $2,114 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of ($3) million. Net income includes offsetting non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $1,987 million, share-based compensation of $314 million, amortization of the discount on debt and debt issuance costs of $52 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $26 million, results relating to equity-accounted investees of ($54) million and changes in deferred taxes of ($211) million.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $2,284 million for the year-ended December 31, 2019 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for purchases of interests in businesses (net of cash) of $1,698 million, relating to the acquisition of the Wifi assets of Marvell, capital expenditures of $526 million and $102 million for the purchase of identified intangible assets, partly offset by proceeds of $37 million from the sale of businesses (net of cash) and $23 million from the disposal of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $522 million for the year-ended December 31, 2018 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for capital expenditures of $611 million and $50 million for the purchase of identified intangible assets, partly offset by proceeds of $159 million from the sale of businesses (net of cash).\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities was $1,831 million for the year-ended December 31, 2019 compared to $4,597 million for the year-ended December 31, 2018. The cash flows related to financing transactions in 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to the financing activities described below under the captions 2019 Financing Activities and 2018 Financing Activities.\nIn addition to the financing activities described below, net cash used for financing activities by year included:\n2019 Financing Activities\n2024 Revolving Credit Facility\nOn June 11, 2019, NXP B.V. together with NXP Funding LLC, entered into a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility agreement, replacing the $600 million secured revolving credit facility, entered into on December 7, 2015.\n2020 Senior Notes\nOn June 11, 2019, NXP B.V. together with NXP Funding LLC, commenced a cash tender offer for any and all of their $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 4.125% Senior Notes due 2020 (\u201c4.125% 2020 Notes\u201d). An amount of $553 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.125% 2020 Notes were tendered in this offer and retired on June 18, 2019. The remaining $47 million were redeemed under the terms of the indenture governing these notes on July 3, 2019.\n2026 and 2029 Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn June 18, 2019, NXP B.V., together with NXP USA Inc. and NXP Funding LLC, issued $750 million of 3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 and $1 billion of 4.3% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029. NXP used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of these notes to repay in full, the 2020 Senior Notes, as described above. The remaining proceeds were used to refinance the $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of Cash Convertible Notes due 2019 issued by NXP Semiconductors N.V. on December 1, 2014 upon the maturity of these notes on December 1, 2019.\n2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes\nOn December 2, 2019, NXP repaid the Cash Convertible Notes upon their maturity through a combination of available cash and payments made by the counterparties under privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the \u201cCash Convertible Notes Hedges\u201d), as further described in Note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.\n2018 Financing Activities\n2024, 2026 and 2028 Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn December 6, 2018, NXP B.V., together with NXP Funding LLC, issued $1 billion of 4.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 1, 2024, $500 million of 5.35% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 1, 2026 and\n$500 million of 5.55% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028. NXP used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of these notes to repay in full the Bridge Loan, as described below. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the repurchase of additional shares of NXP\u2019s common stock.\n2019 Bridge Loan\nOn September 19, 2018, NXP B.V., together with NXP Funding LLC, entered into a $1 billion senior unsecured bridge term credit facility agreement under which an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion of term loans (the \u201cBridge Loan\u201d) was borrowed. The Bridge Loan was to mature on September 18, 2019 and the interest at a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.5 percent. NXP used the net proceeds of the Bridge Loan for general corporate purposes as well as to finance parts of the announced equity buy-back program. On December 6, 2018, the Bridge Loan was repaid in full, as described above.\n2018 Senior Notes\nOn March 8, 2018, NXP B.V., together with NXP Funding LLC, delivered notice that it would repay to holders of its 3.75% Senior Notes due 2018 (the \u201c2018 Notes\u201d) $750 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes, which represented all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes. The repayment occurred in April 2018 using available surplus cash.\n2023 Senior Notes\nOn March 2, 2018, NXP B.V., together with NXP Funding LLC, delivered notice that it would repay to holders of its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) $500 million of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes, which represented all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. The repayment occurred in April 2018 using available surplus cash.\nDebt Position\nShort-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2019, there was no short-term debt outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our short-term debt amounted to $1,107 million.\nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt of:\n(1)\tOn June 9, 2015, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020. On June 11, 2019, an amount of $553 million aggregate principal amount were tendered and on June 18, 2019, retired. The remaining $47 million were redeemed under the terms of the indenture governing these notes on July 3, 2019.\n(2)\tOn May 23, 2016, and August 1, 2016, we issued $850 million and $500 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021.\n(3)\tOn June 9, 2015, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022.\n(4)\tOn August 11, 2016, we issued $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022.\n(5)\tOn May 23, 2016, we issued $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2023.\n(6)\tOn December 6, 2018, we issued $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.35% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.55% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028.\n(7)\tOn June 18, 2019, we issued $750 million of 3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 and $1 billion of 4.3% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029.\n(8)\tOn June 11, 2019, we entered into a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility agreement, replacing the $600 million secured revolving credit facility, entered into on December 7, 2015.\n(9)\tOther long-term debt consists primarily of capital lease obligations.\n(10)\tOther mainly relates to the reclassification of capital lease obligations to current and non-current other liabilities due to the adoption of the new lease standard in 2019.\nWe may from time to time continue to seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. See the discussion in Part II, Item 7. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\n2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes\nWe repaid the Cash Convertible Notes upon their maturity on December 1, 2019 through a combination of available cash and payments made by the counterparties under privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the \u201cCash Convertible Notes Hedges\u201d), as further described in Note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.\nFor a detailed description of the Warrants underlying the Cash Convertible Notes Hedge, refer to Note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements\nContractual Obligations\nPresented below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019.\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had reserves of $170 million recorded for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. We are not including this amount in the long-term contractual obligations table presented because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.\n(2)\nCertain of these obligations are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and have been translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars based on an aggregate average rate of $1.1209 per \u20ac1.00, in effect at December 31, 2019. As a result, the actual payments will vary based on any change in exchange rate.\nIn addition to the above obligations, we enter into a variety of agreements in the normal course of business, containing provisions that certain penalties may be charged if we do not fulfill our commitments. It is not possible to predict with certainty the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar provisions due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular case. Historically, payments pursuant to such provisions have not been material and we believe that any future payments required pursuant to such provisions would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. However, such payments may be material to our Consolidated Statement of Operations for a specific period.\nWe sponsor pension plans in many countries in accordance with legal requirements, customs and the local situation in the countries involved. These are defined-benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and multi-employer plans. Contributions to funded pension plans are made as necessary, to provide sufficient\nassets to meet future benefits payable to plan participants. These contributions are determined by various factors, including funded status, legal and tax considerations and local customs. The expected cash outflows in 2020 and subsequent years are uncertain and may change as a consequence of statutory funding requirements as well as changes in actual versus currently assumed discount rates, estimations of compensation increases and returns on pension plan assets.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include:\n\u2022\nthe valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;\n\u2022\nthe assessment of recoverability of goodwill, identified intangible assets and tangible fixed assets, which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization;\n\u2022\nrevenue recognition, which impacts our results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe recognition of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impacts our provision for income taxes;\n\u2022\nthe assumptions used in the determination of postretirement benefit obligations, which impacts operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe assumptions used in the determination of share based compensation, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nthe recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency or revise the estimates for a loss contingency.\nIn the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review our inventories and write down our inventories for estimated losses due to obsolescence. This allowance is determined for groups of products based on sales of our products in the recent past and/or expected future demand. Future demand is affected by market conditions, technological obsolescence, new products and strategic plans, each of which is subject to change with little or no forewarning. In estimating obsolescence, we utilize information that includes projecting future demand.\nThe need for strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers are balanced against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.\nThe change in our reserves for inventories was primarily due to the normal review and accrual of obsolete or excess inventory. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances can be significant changes in business climate, operating performance or competition, or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. This impairment review compares the fair value for each reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions. We base our fair-value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing.\nFor the annual impairment assessment for the year-ended December 31, 2019, we determined that for our reporting unit,the fair value exceeded the carrying value. During the third and fourth quarter of each of the prior two fiscal years, respectively, we have completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.\nImpairment or disposal of identified intangible assets and tangible fixed assets\nWe perform reviews of property, plant and equipment, and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than what we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Impairment losses, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.\nThe assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. In 2019 and 2018, we had no impairments. In 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $23 million, of which $16 million relative to IPR&D that was acquired from Freescale.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe vast majority of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors, Original Equipment Manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) and similar customers. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. Variable consideration is estimated and includes the impact of discounts, price protection, product returns and distributor incentive programs. The estimate of variable consideration is dependent on a variety of factors, including contractual terms, analysis of historical data, current economic conditions, industry demand and both the current and forecasted pricing environments. The estimate of variable consideration is not constrained because the Company has extensive experience with these contracts.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company\u2019s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment. In determining whether\ncontrol has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title, and whether risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer.\nFor sales to distributors, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to the distributor. For some distributors, contractual arrangements are in place which allow these distributors to return products if certain conditions are met. These conditions generally relate to the time period during which a return is allowed and reflect customary conditions in the particular geographic market. Other return conditions relate to circumstances arising at the end of a product life cycle, when certain distributors are permitted to return products purchased during a pre-defined period after the Company has announced a product\u2019s pending discontinuance. These return rights are a form of variable consideration and are estimated using the most likely method based on historical return rates in order to reduce revenues recognized. However, long notice periods associated with these announcements prevent significant amounts of product from being returned. For sales where return rights exist, the Company has determined, based on historical data, that only a very small percentage of the sales of this type to distributors is actually returned. Repurchase agreements with OEMs or distributors are not entered into by the Company.\nSales to most distributors are made under programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities. These programs may include credits granted to distributors, or allow distributors to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor, or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory. In determining the transaction price, the Company considers the price adjustments from these programs to be variable consideration that reduce the amount of revenue recognized. The Company\u2019s policy is to estimate such price adjustments using the most likely method based on rolling historical experience rates, as well as a prospective view of products and pricing in the distribution channel for distributors who participate in our volume rebate incentive program. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in pricing environments and inventory levels. The estimates are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity. Historically, actual price adjustments for these programs relative to those estimated have not materially differed.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes on dividends from subsidiaries are recognized in situations where the company does not consider the earnings indefinitely reinvested and to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable.\nDeferred tax assets, including assets arising from loss carryforwards, are recognized, net of a valuation allowance, if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.\nThe income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. The income tax benefit recognized is measured based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon resolution of the uncertainty. Unrecognized tax benefits are presented as a reduction to the deferred tax asset for related net operating loss carryforwards, unless these would not be available, in which case the uncertain tax benefits are presented together with the related interest and penalties as a liability, under accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities based on the timing of the expected payment. Penalties are recorded as income tax expense, whereas interest is reported as financial expense in the statement of operations.\nPostretirement benefits\nThe Company\u2019s employees participate in pension and other postretirement benefit plans in many countries. The costs of pension and other postretirement benefits and related assets and liabilities with respect to the Company\u2019s employees participating in defined-benefit plans are based upon actuarial valuations.\nThe projected defined-benefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. For the Company\u2019s major plans, the discount rate is derived from market yields on high quality corporate bonds. Plans in countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local government bond rates.\nIn calculating obligation and expense, the Company is required to select actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation costs determined based on current market conditions, historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries. Changes in the key assumptions can have a significant impact to the projected benefit obligations, funding requirements and periodic pension cost incurred.\nThe Company determines the fair value of plan assets based on quoted prices or comparable prices for non-quoted assets. For a defined-benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement defined benefit plan it is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.\nShare-based compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards based on the grant-date estimated fair values, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for certain awards. Share-based compensation cost for restricted share units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) with time-based vesting is measured based on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant, reduced by the present value of the estimated expected future dividends, and then multiplied by the number of RSUs granted. Share-based compensation cost for performance-based share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) granted with performance or market conditions is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.\nOur valuation models and generally accepted valuation techniques require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, employee turnover rates and employee stock option exercise behaviors. When establishing the expected life assumption, we used the \u2018simplified\u2019 method prescribed in ASC Topic 718 for companies that do not have adequate historical data. The risk-free interest rate is measured as the prevailing yield for a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity similar to the expected life assumption. We also estimate a forfeiture rate at the time of grant and revise this rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from the original estimates.\nWe evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellation of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense.\nLitigation and claims\nWe are regularly involved as plaintiffs or defendants in claims and litigation related to our past and current business operations. The claims can cover a broad range of topics, including intellectual property, reflecting the Company\u2019s identity as a global manufacturing and technology business. The Company vigorously defends itself against improper claims, including those asserted in litigation. Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s accruals will be sufficient to cover the extent of its potential exposure to losses but, historically, legal actions have not had a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based on currently available information in relation to the claims that have arisen and on the Company\u2019s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain claims, the Company believes that an estimate cannot currently be made. The estimated aggregate range requires significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages), the existence of multiple defendants (including the Company) in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the claims, and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate.\nUse of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet debt is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total debt (short-term and long-term) after deduction of cash and cash equivalents. Management believes this measure is appropriate to calculate our net leverage.\nWe understand that, although net debt is used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies, this concept has limitations as an analytical tool and it should not be used as an alternative to any other measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through fixed and variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies. Changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBy using derivative instruments, we are subject to credit and market risk. The fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves, as well as foreign exchange and commodity spot and forward rates, and reflects the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting period. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, thus creating a receivable risk for us. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. We minimize counterparty credit (or repayment) risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. Our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur RCF Agreement has a $1,500 million borrowing capacity with a floating rate interest. As there are currently no borrowings under this facility, a hypothetical increase in LIBOR based interest rates would not have caused any change to our interest expense on our floating rate debt.\nAdditional information regarding our notes is provided in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 14 - Debt, of our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference.\nForeign Currency Risks\nWe are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could affect operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows. We monitor our exposures to these market risks and generally employ operating and financing activities to offset these exposures where appropriate. If we do not have operating or financing activities to sufficiently offset these exposures, from time to time, we may employ derivative financial instruments such as swaps, collars, forwards, options or other instruments to limit the volatility to earnings and cash flows generated by these exposures. Derivative financial instruments are only used for hedging purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes. Counterparties to our derivatives\ncontracts are all major banking institutions. In the event of financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligation to us, which could have a negative impact on our results. The Company measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values derived from market prices of the instruments or from option pricing models, as appropriate and record these as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair values are recognized in the statement of operations immediately unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied. A summary of our foreign currency accounting policies is provided in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, of our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference.\nAt December 31, 2019 our net asset related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on certain operating expenditure transactions was $9 million. If our forecasted operating expenditures for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in our hedged foreign currency, we would incur a negligible loss.\nFinancial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments.\nOur primary foreign currency exposure relates to the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. However, our foreign currency exposures also relate, but are not limited, to the Chinese Yuan, the Japanese Yen, the Pound Sterling, the Malaysian Ringgit, the Singapore Dollar, the Taiwan Dollar and the Thailand Baht.",

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of fair value of certain intangible assets acquired in Marvell business acquisition\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on December 6, 2019, the Company acquired Marvell\u2019s Wireless WiFi Connectivity Business Unit, Bluetooth technology portfolio and related assets (\u201cMarvell\u201d) in a business combination for net consideration of $1,705 million. The assets acquired included amongst others $324 million of developed technology and $170 million of in-process R&D. Management valued these intangible assets on a preliminary basis using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present values of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the developed technology and in-process R&D less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows.\nWe identified the evaluation of the preliminary acquisition date fair values of the developed technology and in-process R&D as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the discounted cash flow models used to calculate the acquisition-date fair value of these intangible assets including the allocation of projected cash flows between developed technology and in-process R&D. In addition, the discounted cash flow models included internally-developed assumptions such as expected revenue growth rates, profitability and discount rates, and the calculated fair values of such assets were sensitive to possible changes to these assumptions.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s acquisition-date valuation process including controls related to the development of the assumptions based on comparable market data. We compared the assumptions, including the Company\u2019s forecasted growth rates and profitability, to those of market participants. We also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in developing an estimate of the fair value of the acquired business using the Company\u2019s cash flow forecast and an independently developed discount rate, and\nevaluating the Company\u2019s discount rate by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities and transactions.\nEvaluation of the accrued liability and disclosure of range of reasonably possible losses related to personal injury claims\nAs discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved as a defendant in personal injury claims. Specifically, the Company is involved in legal proceedings claiming personal injuries to the children of former employees as a result of the employees\u2019 alleged exposure to chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments operated by the Company or former parent companies Philips and Motorola. These personal injury claims allege a link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room facilities and birth defects. As at December 31, 2019, the Company has accrued $44 million and disclosed the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the amount accrued between $0 million and $66 million for potential and current legal proceedings, of which a portion relates to personal injury claims.\nWe identified the evaluation of the accrued liability and the disclosure of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the amount accrued related to personal injury claims as a critical audit matter, because it required subjective auditor judgment. This is due to the nature of the estimate resulting from the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous unresolved issues in many of the claims, and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s personal injury claims accrual and disclosure process, including controls related to the evaluation of information from external and internal legal counsel and controls related to the development of assumptions and review of other information used in the Company\u2019s calculations. We inspected letters received directly from the Company\u2019s external legal counsel to confirm underlying information used by the Company in its calculation of the accrual and the range of reasonably possible losses. We inquired of management and its internal legal counsel and evaluated key inputs and assumptions used in its calculation. We evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to estimate its monetary exposure to personal injury claims by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual amounts incurred through settlement agreements.\n/s/ KPMG Accountants N.V.\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2009.\nAmstelveen, the Netherlands\nFebruary 27, 2020\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n*\nReclassification adjustments included in Cost of revenue, Selling, general and administrative, Research and development and Results relating to equity-accounted investees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nAll amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Overview\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Net income (loss) includes the portion of the earnings of subsidiaries applicable to non-controlling interests. The income (loss) and equity attributable to non-controlling interests are disclosed separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under non-controlling interests. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.\nSegment reporting\nPrior to January 1, 2019, HPMS was our sole reportable segment. Corporate and Other represented the remaining portion to reconcile to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2019, NXP removed the reference to HPMS in its organizational structure in acknowledgment of the one reportable segment representing the entity as a whole and reflects the way in which our chief operating decision maker executes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the Company.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMarvell\nIn December 2019, we completed the acquisition of Marvell\u2019s Wireless WiFi Connectivity Business Unit, Bluetooth technology portfolio and related assets, for $1.7 billion in cash, net of closing adjustments.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe vast majority of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors, Original Equipment Manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) and similar customers. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. Variable consideration is estimated and includes the impact of discounts, price protection, product returns and distributor incentive programs. The estimate of variable consideration is dependent on a variety of factors, including contractual terms, analysis of historical data, current economic conditions, industry demand and both the current and forecasted pricing environments. The process of evaluating these factors is highly subjective and requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, forecasted demand, returns, pricing assumptions and inventory levels. The estimate of variable consideration is not constrained because the Company has extensive experience with these contracts.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company\u2019s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment. In determining whether\ncontrol has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title, and whether risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer. The Company expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.\nFor sales to distributors, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to the distributor. For some distributors, contractual arrangements are in place which allow these distributors to return products if certain conditions are met. These conditions generally relate to the time period during which a return is allowed and reflect customary conditions in the particular geographic market. Other return conditions relate to circumstances arising at the end of a product life cycle, when certain distributors are permitted to return products purchased during a pre-defined period after the Company has announced a product\u2019s pending discontinuance. These return rights are a form of variable consideration and are estimated using the most likely method based on historical return rates in order to reduce revenues recognized. However, long notice periods associated with these announcements prevent significant amounts of product from being returned. For sales where return rights exist, the Company has determined, based on historical data, that only a very small percentage of the sales of this type to distributors is actually returned. Repurchase agreements with OEMs or distributors are not entered into by the Company.\nSales to most distributors are made under programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities. These programs may include credits granted to distributors, or allow distributors to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor, or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory. In determining the transaction price, the Company considers the price adjustments from these programs to be variable consideration that reduce the amount of revenue recognized. The Company\u2019s policy is to estimate such price adjustments using the most likely method based on rolling historical experience rates, as well as a prospective view of products and pricing in the distribution channel for distributors who participate in our volume rebate incentive program. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in pricing environments and inventory levels. The estimates are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity. Historically, actual price adjustments for these programs relative to those estimated have not materially differed.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at acquisition that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at face value which approximates fair value.\nReceivables\nReceivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and net of rebates and other contingent discounts granted to distributors. When circumstances indicate a specific customer\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligation to us is impaired, we record an allowance against amounts due and value the receivable at the amount reasonably expected to be collected. For all other customers, we evaluate our trade accounts receivable for collectability based on numerous factors including objective evidence about credit-risk concentration, collective debt risk based on average historical losses, and specific circumstances such as serious adverse economic conditions in a specific country or region.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, less advance payments on work in progress. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. An allowance is made for the estimated losses due to obsolescence. This allowance is determined for groups of products based on purchases in the recent past and/or expected future demand and market conditions. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expense and waste are not capitalized in inventory. The allocation of fixed production overheads to the inventory cost is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected economic life of the asset. Depreciation of special tooling is also based on the straight-line method unless a depreciation method other than the straight-line method better represents the consumption pattern. Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in other income and expense. Plant and equipment under capital leases are initially recorded at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value of minimum lease payments. These assets and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 is intended to improve financial reporting of leasing transactions by requiring organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases that extend more than twelve months from the balance sheet date. This accounting update also requires additional disclosures surrounding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for financial statements issued for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for public business entities and we have adopted the standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), followed in July 2018 by ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 Leases, and ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. Under the new transition method, an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. As a result of this adoption and the required disclosures, the Company revised its accounting policy for leases as stated below.\nThe new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. See also Note 15, Leases.\nWe elected to adopt the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs, along with the practical expedient to use hindsight when determining the lease term.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the arrangement. Once it is determined that an arrangement is, or contains, a lease, that determination should only be reassessed if the legal arrangement is modified. Changes to assumptions such as market-based factors do not trigger a reassessment. Determining whether a contract contains a lease requires judgement. In general, arrangements are considered to be a lease when all of the following apply:\n-\nIt conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration;\n-\nWe have substantially all economic benefits from the use of the asset; and\n-\nWe can direct the use of the identified asset\nThe terms of a lease arrangement determine how a lease is classified and the resulting income statement recognition. When the terms of a lease effectively transfer control of the underlying asset, the lease represents an in substance financed purchase (sale) of an asset and the lease is classified as a finance lease by the lessee and a sales-type lease by the lessor. When a lease does not effectively transfer control of the underlying asset to the lessee, but the lessor obtains a guarantee for the value of the asset from a third party, the lessor would classify a lease as a direct financing lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\nWith the exception of four instances (with a combined value of $82 million), the Company\u2019s lease arrangements are all operating leases.\nLease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at January 1, 2019 or commencement date, if later, in determining the present value of future payments. The lease ROU asset includes any lease payment made and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease which are included in the measurement of the ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nFor operating leases, the lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the Consolidated statement of operations over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The finance lease asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. Except for gas and chemical contracts, NXP did not make the election to treat the lease and non-lease components as a single component, and considers the non-lease components as a separate unit of account.\nBusiness combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates and judgments that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of acquired intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. Further judgment is required in estimating the fair values of deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date, as well as inventory, property, plant and equipment, pre-existing liabilities or legal claims, deferred revenue and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable.\nThe fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies as well as the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected revenue growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. As such, acquired tangible and identified intangible assets are classified as Level 3 assets. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions\nGoodwill\nWe record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. We assign the goodwill to our reporting unit based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. We perform an impairment assessment at least once annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. We perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary. The reporting unit\u2019s carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments and debt.\nIdentified intangible assets\nLicensed technology and patents are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods of benefit. We amortize all acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit. Acquisition-related in-process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these assets are not subject to amortization. Assets related to projects that have been completed are subject to amortization, while assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired and expensed to R&D. In the quarter following the period in which identified intangible assets become fully amortized, we remove the fully amortized balances from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts.\nWe perform a quarterly review of finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the useful live is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If an asset\u2019s useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. We perform an impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets at least once annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If necessary, a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.\nFair value measurements\nFair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for an identical asset or liability, we develop assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, utilize internal information that we consider to be consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. Priority is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs form the basis for the following fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022\nLevel 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u2022\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and valuations based on models where the inputs or significant value drivers are observable, either directly or indirectly.\n\u2022\nLevel 3: Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\nForeign currencies\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency. The functional currency of the holding company is the U.S. dollar. For consolidation purposes, the financial statements of the entities within the Company with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rates on the applicable balance sheet dates. Income and expense items in the statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows are translated at monthly exchange rates in the periods involved.\nThe effects of translating the financial position and results of operations from functional currencies to reporting currency are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders\u2019 equity. If the operation is a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is recorded under non-controlling interests.\nThe following table sets out the exchange rates for U.S. dollars into euros applicable for translation of NXP\u2019s financial statements for the periods specified.\n(1)\tThe average of the noon-buying rate at the end of each fiscal month during the period presented.\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of operations, except when the foreign exchange exposure is part of a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge accounting relationship, in which case the related foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective and presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders\u2019 equity. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognized in the statement of operations. Currency gains and losses on intercompany loans that have the nature of a permanent investment are recognized as translation differences in other comprehensive income and are presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity.\nDerivative financial instruments including hedge accounting\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in the management of its foreign currency risks and the input costs of gold for a portion of our anticipated purchases within the next 12 months.\nThe Company measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values derived from market prices of the instruments or from option pricing models, as appropriate, and records these as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair values are immediately recognized in the statement of operations unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. The application of cash flow hedge accounting for foreign currency risks is limited to transactions that represent a substantial currency risk that could materially affect the financial position of the Company.\nForeign currency gains or losses arising from the translation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that the hedge is effective, and are presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders\u2019 equity.\nTo the extent that a hedge is ineffective, the ineffective portion of the fair value change is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the corresponding amount in the accumulated other comprehensive income is transferred to the statement of operations as part of the profit or loss on disposal.\nOn initial designation of the hedge relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, the Company documents this relationship, including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction and the hedged risk, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Company makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments are expected to be \u201chighly effective\u201d in\noffsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items attributable to the hedged risk.\nWhen cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because it is not probable that a forecasted transaction will occur within a period of two months from the originally forecasted transaction date, the Company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings. In situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the Company continues to carry the derivative at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings.\nThe gross notional amounts of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives by currency for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nDividends to shareholders\nDividends to the Company\u2019s shareholders are charged to retained earnings when the dividends are approved.\nStock repurchases and retirement\nFor each reacquisition of common stock, the number of shares and the acquisition price for those shares is added to the existing treasury stock count and total value. When treasury shares are retired, the Company's policy is to allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired to both Retained Earnings and Capital in Excess of Par. The portion allocated to Capital in Excess of Par is calculated by applying a percentage, determined by dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares issued, to the balance of Capital in Excess of Par as of the retirement date.\nResearch and development\nCosts of research and development are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for in-process research and development assets acquired in business combinations, which are capitalized and, after completion, are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred.\nDebt issuance costs\nDirect costs incurred to obtain financings are capitalized and subsequently amortized over the term of the debt using the effective interest rate method. Upon extinguishment of any related debt, any unamortized debt issuance costs are expensed immediately.\nRestructuring\nThe provision for restructuring relates to the estimated costs of initiated restructurings that have been approved by Management. When such plans require discontinuance and/or closure of lines of activities, the anticipated costs of closure or discontinuance are recorded at fair value when the liability has been incurred. The Company determines the fair value based on discounted projected cash flows in the absence of other observable inputs such as quoted prices. The restructuring liability includes the estimated cost of termination benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement, costs to terminate leases and other contracts, and selling costs associated with assets held for sale and other costs related to the closure of facilities. One-time employee termination benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period when those employees are required to render services to the Company, if that period exceeds 60 days or a longer legal notification period. However, generally, employee termination benefits are covered by a contract or an ongoing benefit arrangement and are recognized when it is probable that the employees will be entitled to the benefits and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) primarily consists of gains and losses related to divestment of activities and subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses related to the sale of long-lived assets and other non-core operating items. As from January 1, 2019, this includes income derived from manufacturing service arrangements (\u201cMSA\u201d) and transitional service arrangements (\u201cTSA\u201d) that are put in place when we divest a business or activity as well as related expenditures.\nFinancial income and expense\nFinancial income and expense is comprised of interest income on cash and cash equivalent balances, the interest expense on borrowings, the accretion of the discount or premium on issued debt, the gain or loss on the disposal of financial assets, impairment losses on financial assets and gains or losses on hedging instruments recognized in the statement of operations.\nBorrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of operations using the effective interest method.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax liabilities for income taxes or withholding taxes on dividends from subsidiaries are recognized in situations where the company does not consider the earnings indefinitely reinvested and to the extent that the withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable.\nDeferred tax assets, including assets arising from loss carryforwards, are recognized, net of a valuation allowance, if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.\nThe income tax benefit from a tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. The income tax benefit recognized is measured based on the largest benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the uncertainty. A liability for unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest and penalties is recorded under accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the balance sheet based on the timing of the expected payment. Penalties related to income taxes are recorded as income tax expense, whereas interest is reported as financial expense in the statement of operations.\nPostretirement benefits\nThe Company\u2019s employees participate in pension and other postretirement benefit plans in many countries. The costs of pension and other postretirement benefits and related assets and liabilities with respect to the Company\u2019s employees participating in the various plans are based upon actuarial valuations.\nSome of the Company\u2019s defined-benefit pension plans are funded with plan assets that have been segregated and restricted in a trust, foundation or insurance company to provide for the pension benefits to which the Company has committed itself.\nThe net liability or asset recognized in the balance sheet in respect of the postretirement plans is the present value of the projected benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date. Most of the Company\u2019s plans are unfunded and result in a provision or a net liability.\nFor the Company\u2019s major plans, the discount rate is derived from market yields on high quality corporate bonds. Plans in countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local government bond rates.\nBenefit plan costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of the expected return on plan assets and net of employee contributions.\nActuarial gains and losses arise mainly from changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. They are recognized in the statement of operations, over the expected average remaining service periods of the employees only to the extent that their net cumulative amount exceeds 10% of the greater of the present value of the obligation or of the fair value of plan assets at the end of the previous year (the corridor). Events which invoke a curtailment or a settlement of a benefit plan will be recognized in our statement of operations.\nIn calculating obligation and expense, the Company is required to select actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, assumed health care trend rates and rates of increase in compensation costs determined based on current market conditions, historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries. Changes in the key assumptions can have a significant impact to the projected benefit obligations, funding requirements and periodic cost incurred.\nUnrecognized prior-service costs related to the plans are amortized to the statements of operations over the average remaining service period of the active employees.\nContributions to defined-contribution and multi-employer pension plans are recognized as an expense in the statements of operations as incurred.\nThe Company determines the fair value of plan assets based on quoted prices or comparable prices for non-quoted assets. For a defined-benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement defined benefit plan it is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.\nThe Company recognizes as a component of other comprehensive income, net of taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs that arise during the year but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, including the gains or losses and the prior services costs are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs.\nFor all of the Company\u2019s postretirement benefit plans, the measurement date is December 31, our year-end.\nShare-based compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards based on the grant-date estimated fair values, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for certain awards. Share-based compensation cost for restricted share units (\u201cRSU\u201ds) with time-based vesting is measured based on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant, reduced by the present value of the estimated expected future dividends, and then multiplied by the number of RSUs granted. Share-based compensation cost for performance-based share units (\u201cPSU\u201ds) granted with performance or market conditions is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.\nThe value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For stock options and RSUs, the grant-date value, less estimated pre-vest forfeitures, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. PSUs are expensed using a graded vesting schedule. The vesting period for stock options is generally four years, for RSUs and PSUs it is generally three years.\nEarnings per share\nBasic earnings per share attributable to stockholders is calculated by dividing net income or loss attributable to stockholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\nTo determine diluted share count, we apply the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of outstanding stock option shares, RSUs, PSUs and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) shares. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising share-based awards and the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\nConcentration of risk\nFinancial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, that may potentially subject NXP to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments, accounts receivable and forward contracts.\nWe sell our products to OEMs and to distributors in various markets, who resell these products to OEMs, or their subcontract manufacturers. One of our distributors accounted for 14% of our revenue in 2019, 14% in 2018 and 15% in 2017. One other distributor accounted for less than 10% of our revenue in 2019, 10% in 2018 and less than 10% in 2017. No other distributor accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue for 2019, 2018 or 2017. One OEM for which we had direct sales to accounted for 11% of our revenue in 2019, 11% in 2018 and 11% in 2017. No other individual OEM for which we had direct sales to accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nCredit exposure related to NXP\u2019s foreign currency forward contracts is limited to the realized and unrealized gains on these contracts.\nThe Company is using outside suppliers or foundries for a portion of its manufacturing capacity.\nWe have operations in Europe and Asia subject to collective bargaining agreements which could pose a risk to the Company in the near term but we do not expect that our operations will be disrupted if such is the case.\nNew accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, the one step quantitative impairment test\ncalculates goodwill impairment as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value, up to the carrying value of the goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 removes certain disclosure requirements, including the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels, and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 also adds disclosure requirements, including changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans. ASU 2018-14 removes disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial, clarifies the specific requirements of disclosures, and adds disclosure requirements identified as relevant. ASU 2018-14 should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 requires a customer in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. Therefore, a customer in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract determines which project stage an implementation activity relates to. Costs for implementation activities in the application development stage are capitalized depending on the nature of the costs, while costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as the activities are performed. ASU 2018-15 also requires the customer to expense the capitalized implementation costs over the term of the hosting arrangement, and to apply the existing impairment guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to the capitalized implementation costs as if the costs were long-lived assets. ASU 2018-15 can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nAccounting standards adopted in 2019\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Existing sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance for real estate, is replaced with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 Leases, and ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. ASU 2018-11 clarifies narrow aspects of Topic 842. ASU 2018-11 provides entities with an additional transition method to adopt the new leases standard. Under the new transition method, an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01\nLeases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements, which clarified transition disclosures. The new leases standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019, and the Company applied the new transition method in ASU 2018-11. The most significant impact of adopting ASC 842 was related to recording lease asset and related liabilities on our balance sheet, which did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvement to Accounting for Hedging Activities. ASU 2017-12 simplifies certain aspects of hedge accounting and improves disclosures of hedging arrangements through the elimination of the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. The ASU generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. Entities must apply the amendments to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption using a modified retrospective approach. The presentation and disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively. ASU 2017-12 became effective for us on January 1, 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nNo other new accounting pronouncements were issued or became effective in the period that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 3 - Acquisitions and Divestments\nOn December 6, 2019, we completed the acquisition Marvell\u2019s Wireless WiFi Connectivity Business Unit, Bluetooth technology portfolio and related assets for total consideration of $1.7 billion, net of closing adjustments. The acquisition complements NXP\u2019s processing, security and connectivity offerings in the Industrial & IoT, as well as in the Automotive and Communication Infrastructure markets.\nThe preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition, by major class, were recognized as follows:\nThe purchase price allocation contained preliminary valuations related to identified intangible assets as some of the estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period as additional information becomes available.\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition is attributed to the anticipated growth from new product sales, sales to new customers, the assembled workforce and synergies expected from the combination. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe identified intangible assets assumed were recognized as follows:\n1)\nAcquired in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) is an intangible asset classified as an indefinite lived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development effort. IPR&D will be amortized over an estimated useful life to be determined at the date the associated research and development effort is completed, or expensed immediately when, and if, the project is abandoned. Acquired IPR&D is not amortized during the period that it is considered indefinite lived, but rather is subject to annual testing for impairment or when there are indicators for impairment.\nVariations of the income approach were applied to estimate the fair values of the intangible assets acquired. Developed technology and IPR&D were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method which reflects the present values of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the existing technology and IPR&D less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. Customer relationships were valued using the distributor method which uses market-based data to support the selection of profitability related to the customer relationship function.\nAcquisition-related transaction costs ($5 million) such as legal, accounting and other related expenses were recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations.\nPro forma financial information (unaudited)\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents combined consolidated results of operations for each of the fiscal years presented, as if Marvell\u2019s Wireless WiFi Connectivity Business Unit, Bluetooth technology portfolio and related assets had been acquired as of January 1, 2018:\nThe pro forma information include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimate changes in amortization and depreciation for identified intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired and adjustments to share-based compensation expense. The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the revenue or operating results that would have been achieved had the acquisition actually taken place as of January 1, 2018 or of the results of future operations of the combined business. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect synergies that might be achieved from the combined operations.\nOn March 27, 2019, we sold our remaining equity interest in WeEn, receiving net cash proceeds of $37 million.\nThere were no material acquisitions during 2018. On July 10, 2018, NXP completed the sale of its 40% equity interest of Suzhou ASEN Semiconductors Co., Ltd. to J&R Holding Limited, receiving $127 million in cash proceeds.

At December 31, 2018, due to the intended sale of the remaining interest in WeEn, NXP transferred the remaining holding to other current assets.\nThere were no material acquisitions during 2017. On April 19, 2017, we sold our shares in Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation Ltd. (ASMC), representing a 27.47 percent ownership, for a total consideration of $54 million. The gain on the sale of $31 million is included in the Statement of Operations in the line item \u201cResults relating to equity-accounted investees\u201d.\nOn February 6, 2017, we divested our Standard Products (\u201cSP\u201d) business to a consortium of financial investors consisting of Beijing JianGuang Asset Management Co., Ltd (\u201cJAC Capital\u201d) and Wise Road Capital LTD (\u201cWise Road Capital\u201d), receiving $2.6 billion in cash proceeds, net of cash divested. Prior to February 6, 2017, the results of the SP business were included in the reportable segment SP.\nThe gain on the sale of $1,597 million is included in the Statement of Operations in the line item \u201cOther income (expense)\u201d and is composed of the following:\nNote 4 - Assets Held for Sale\nIn the second quarter of 2019, NXP management, in reviewing its portfolio, concluded that certain activities (Voice and Audio Solutions (VAS)) no longer fit the NXP strategic portfolio and took actions that resulted in the assets meeting the held for sale criteria. On August 16, 2019, NXP reached a definitive agreement with Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co., Ltd. (\"Goodix\") from China, under which Goodix will acquire all of these assets for an amount of $165 million. On February 3, 2020, we completed the transaction. Refer to Note 24 Subsequent Events.\nThe VAS assets presentation as held for sale does not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation at December 31, 2019 primarily due to the disposal of this business not representing a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the VAS assets held for sale:\nNote 5 - Supplemental Financial Information\nStatement of Operations Information\nDisaggregation of revenue\nThe following table presents revenue disaggregated by sales channel:\n1)\nAs noted above, prior period amounts have not been adjusted for the impact of adopting ASC 606 under the modified retrospective method.\n2)\nPrior year information has been reclassified to align with NXP's current year presentation.\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment\nDepreciation and amortization, including impairment charges, are as follows:\n(*)\nFor the period ending December 31, 2017, the amount includes IPR&D impairment charges of $23 million, of which $16 million related to assets acquired from Freescale.\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment is primarily included in cost of revenue.\nOther income (expense)\nAs of January 1, 2019, income derived from manufacturing service arrangements (\u201cMSA\u201d) and transitional service arrangements (\u201cTSA\u201d) that are put in place when we divest a business or activity, is included in other income (expense). These arrangements are short-term in nature and are expected to decrease as the divested business or activity becomes more established.\nFinancial income (expense)\n(*)\nFor the period ending December 31, 2018, the amount includes one-time charges ($60 million) on certain financial instruments for compensation related to an adjustment event required by the termination of the Qualcomm Purchase Agreement.\nEquity-accounted investees\nResults related to equity-accounted investees at the end of each period were as follows:\nThe total carrying value of investments in equity-accounted investees is summarized as follows:\nIn July 2018, we completed the sale of our 40% equity interest in Suzhou ASEN Semiconductors Co., Ltd., receiving $127 million in cash proceeds.\nIn June 2018, we completed the sale of 24% of our equity interest in WeEn, receiving $32 million in cash proceeds. At December 31, 2018, due to the intended sale of the remaining interest in WeEn, NXP transferred the remaining holding to other current assets.\nOn April 19, 2017, we sold our shares in Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation Ltd. (ASMC), representing a 27.47 percent ownership, for total consideration of $54 million. The gain on the sale of $31 million is included in the Statement of Operations in the line item \u201cResults relating to equity-accounted investees\u201d.\nBalance Sheet Information\nCash and cash equivalents\nAt December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our cash balance was $1,045 million and $2,789 million, respectively, of which $188 million and $140 million was held by SSMC, our consolidated joint venture company with TSMC. Under the terms of our joint venture agreement with TSMC, a portion of this cash can be distributed by way of a dividend to us, but 38.8% of the dividend will be paid to our joint venture partner. During 2019, no dividend (2018: $139 million) was paid by SSMC.\nNote 6 - Restructuring Charges\nAt each reporting date, we evaluate our restructuring liabilities, which consist primarily of termination benefits, to ensure that our accruals are still appropriate. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no new significant restructuring programs.\nThe following table presents the changes in the position of restructuring liabilities in 2019:\n(1)\nOther changes primarily related to translation differences and internal transfers.\nThe total restructuring liability as of December 31, 2019 of $32 million is classified in the balance sheet under current liabilities.\nThe utilization of the restructuring liabilities mainly reflects the execution of ongoing restructuring programs the Company initiated in earlier years.\nThe following table presents the changes in the position of restructuring liabilities in 2018:\n(1)\nOther changes primarily related to translation differences and internal transfers.\nThe total restructuring liability as of December 31, 2018 of $65 million is classified in the balance sheet under current liabilities ($60 million) and non-current liabilities ($5 million).\nThe utilization of the restructuring liabilities mainly reflects the execution of ongoing restructuring programs the Company initiated in earlier years.\nThe components of restructuring charges recorded in 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nThe restructuring charges recorded in operating income are included in the following line items in the statement of operations:\nNote 7 - Income Taxes\nIn 2019, NXP generated income before income taxes of $291 million (2018: income of $2,375; 2017: income of $1,736 million). The components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows:\nThe components of income tax benefit (expense) are as follows:\nA reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate in the Netherlands as a percentage of income (loss) before income taxes and the effective income tax rate is as follows:\n1)\nThis is only relating to the 2017 provisional income tax.\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $20 million in 2019, which reflects an effective tax rate of 6.9% compared to an expense of $176 million and an effective rate of 7.4% in 2018.The effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives, a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the Netherlands statutory tax rate, adjustments of prior years' income taxes, change in valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses. The impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods, with the significant drivers outlined below:\n\u2022\nThe Company benefits from certain tax incentives, which reduce the effective tax rate in a relative location. The dollar amount of the incentive in any given year is commensurate with the taxable income in that same period. For 2019, the Netherlands tax incentives was lower than 2018, mainly due to the fact that NXP had received a break-up fee from Qualcomm of $2 billion in 2018 which drove a higher income before tax in 2018.\n\u2022\nThe adjustments to prior years\u2019 income taxes was higher in 2018 as a result of the agreement NXP reached with the Dutch tax authorities relative to the application of the Dutch innovation box regime to the taxable income attributable to the Netherlands. This agreement is effective from January 1, 2017. As such, the Company was able to refine its estimate of the Dutch tax liability, recognizing an additional income tax benefit of $67 million in 2018.\n\u2022\nThe increase in the valuation allowance is mainly due to new Dutch corporate income tax law applicable as from 2019. A portion of the interest expenses is non-deductible in the year it is recorded but can be carried forward without expiration.\n\u2022\nThe higher other differences in 2018 relate primarily to a tax benefit on the liquidation of a former investment of $45 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law what is informally called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a comprehensive U.S. tax reform package that was effective January 1, 2018. Under the accounting rules, companies are required to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws and tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. The effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on NXP\u2019s 2017 Financial Statements was an income tax benefit of $734 million. No election was made to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In 2018, the analysis of the enactment date impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was finalized. Accordingly, an additional income tax benefit of $3 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Company benefits from income tax holidays in certain jurisdictions which provide that we pay reduced income taxes in those jurisdictions for a fixed period of time that varies depending on the jurisdiction. The predominant income tax holiday is expected to expire at the end of 2026. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign income taxes by $12 million in 2019 (2018: $21 million; 2017: $23 million). The benefit of this tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was $0.04 in 2019 (2018: $0.06; 2017: $0.07).\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities\nThe principal components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:\nThe classification of the deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:\nThe Company has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that may reduce taxable income or income taxes payable in future periods. Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets based on a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d threshold. The realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance increased by $45 million during 2019 (2018: $5 million increase). Besides the net change in the valuation allowance of $59 million this also includes a decrease of the valuation allowance due to a change in tax rates for $6 million and the expiration of tax attributes for $8 million.\nWe consider all available evidence in forming a judgment regarding the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019, including events that occur subsequent to year end but prior to the issuance of the financial statements. The deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that we consider it more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including reversal of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nAt December 31, 2019 tax loss carryforwards of $734 million (inclusive of $191 million of U.S. state tax losses) will expire as follows:\nThis overview is excluding disallowed interest carryforwards of $479 million which have an unlimited expiration date.\nThe Company also has tax credit carryforwards of $500 million (excluding the effect of unrecognized tax benefits), which are available to offset future tax, if any, and which will expire as follows:\nThe net income tax receivable (excluding the liability for unrecognized tax benefits) as of December 31, 2019 amounted to $2 million (2018: net income tax payable of $154 million) and includes amounts directly receivable from or payable to tax authorities.\nThe Company does not indefinitely reinvest the majority of the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries. Consequently, the Company has recognized a deferred tax liability of $99 million at December 31, 2019 (2018: $96 million) for the additional income taxes and withholding taxes payable upon the future remittances of these earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company considers $45 million of the undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested although the timing of the reversal can be controlled. Upon repatriation of those earnings the Company would be subject to tax of $9 million which is not recognized as deferred tax liability at December 31, 2019.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties is as follows:\nOf the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019, $134 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. All other unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate as these would be offset by compensating adjustments in the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets that would be subject to valuation allowance based on conditions existing at the reporting date.\nThe Company classifies interest related to an underpayment of income taxes as financial expense and penalties as income tax expense. The total related interest and penalties recorded during the year 2019 amounted to a $3 million benefit (2018: $3 million benefit; 2017: $6 million expense). As of December 31, 2019 the Company has recognized a liability for related interest and penalties of $11 million (2018: $14 million; 2017: $17 million). It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may significantly\nincrease/decrease within the next 12 months of the reporting date due to, for example, completion of tax examinations. It is estimated that this reasonably possible change will not be significant.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the Netherlands, the U.S.A. and in various other foreign jurisdictions. Tax filings of our subsidiaries are routinely audited in the normal course of business by tax authorities around the world. Tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions: the Netherlands (2016-2018), Germany (2013-2018), USA (2005-2018), China (2009-2018), Taiwan (2014-2018), Thailand (2014-2018), Malaysia (2011-2018) and India (2004, 2005, 2007-2018).\nNote 8 - Accounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable, net are summarized as follows:\nThe following table presents accounts receivable, net disaggregated by sales channel:\n1)\nRepresents accounts receivable, net for other services.\nNote 9 - Inventories, net\nInventories are summarized as follows:\nThe portion of finished goods stored at customer locations under consignment amounted to $41 million as of December 31, 2019 (2018: $52 million).\nThe amounts recorded above are net of an allowance for obsolescence of $114 million as of December 31, 2019 (2018: $111 million).\nNote 10 - Property, Plant and Equipment, net\nThe following table presents details of the Company\u2019s property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation:\nLand with a book value of $164 million (2018: $165 million) is not depreciated.\nThere was no significant construction in progress and therefore no related capitalized interest.\nNote 11 - Identified Intangible Assets\nThe changes in identified intangible assets were as follows:\nIdentified intangible assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively were composed of the following:\n(1) IPR&D is not subject to amortization until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development effort.\nThe estimated amortization expense for these identified intangible assets, excluding software, for each of the five succeeding years is:\nAll intangible assets, excluding IPR&D and goodwill, are subject to amortization and have no assumed residual value.\nThe expected weighted average remaining life of identified intangibles is 3 years as of December 31, 2019.\nNote 12 - Goodwill\nThe changes in goodwill in 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nNo goodwill impairment charges were required to be recognized in 2019 or 2018\nThe fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit.\nSee Note 23, \u201cSegments and Geographical Information\u201d, for goodwill by segment and Note 3, \u201cAcquisitions and Divestments\u201d.\nNote 13 - Postretirement Benefit Plans\nPensions\nOur employees participate in employee pension plans in accordance with the legal requirements, customs and the local situation in the respective countries. These are defined-benefit pension plans, defined-contribution plans and multi-employer plans.\nThe Company\u2019s employees in The Netherlands participate in a multi-employer plan, implemented for the employees of the Metal and Electrical Engineering Industry (\"Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds Metalektro\" or \"PME\") in accordance with the mandatory affiliation to PME effective for the industry in which NXP operates. As this affiliation is a legal requirement for the Metal and Electrical Engineering Industry it has no expiration date. This PME multi-employer plan (a career average plan) covers 1,380 companies and 631,000 participants. The plan monitors its risk on an aggregate basis, not by company or participant and can therefore not be accounted for as a defined benefit plan. The pension fund rules state that the only obligation for affiliated companies will be to pay the annual plan contributions. There is no obligation for affiliated companies to fund plan deficits. Affiliated companies are also not entitled to any possible surpluses in the pension fund.\nEvery participating company contributes the same fixed percentage of its total pension base, being pensionable salary minus an individual offset. The Company\u2019s pension cost for any period is the amount of contributions due for that period.\nThe contribution rate for the mandatory scheme will increase from 25.02% (2019) to 26.41% (2020).\nThe amount for pension costs included in the statement of operations for the year 2019 was $98 million (2018: $105 million; 2017: $97 million) of which $47 million (2018: $49 million; 2017: $42 million) represents defined-contribution plans and $27 million (2018: $30 million; 2017: $31 million) represents the PME multi-employer plans.\nDefined-benefit plans\nThe benefits provided by defined-benefit plans are based on employees\u2019 years of service and compensation levels. Contributions are made by the Company, as necessary, to provide assets sufficient to meet the benefits payable to defined-benefit pension plan participants.\nThese contributions are determined based upon various factors, including funded status, legal and tax considerations as well as local customs. The Company funds certain defined-benefit pension plans as claims are incurred.\nThe total cost of defined-benefit plans amounted to a cost of $24 million in 2019 (2018: a cost of $26 million; 2017: a benefit of $1 million) consisting of $24 million ongoing cost (2018: $26 million ongoing cost; 2017: $24 million ongoing cost offset by a gain of $25 million from special events resulting from restructurings, divestments, curtailments and settlements).\nThe table below provides a summary of the changes in the pension benefit obligations and defined-benefit pension plan assets for 2019 and 2018, associated with the Company\u2019s dedicated plans, and a reconciliation of the funded status of these plans to the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe weighted average assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations were as follows:\nThe weighted average assumptions used to calculate the net periodic pension cost were as follows:\nFor the Company\u2019s major plans, the discount rate used is based on high quality corporate bonds (iBoxx Corporate Euro AA 10+).\nPlans in countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local sovereign rate and the plans maturity (Bloomberg Government Bond Yields).\nExpected returns per asset class are based on the assumption that asset valuations tend to return to their respective long-term equilibria. The Expected Return on Assets for any funded plan equals the average of the expected returns per asset class weighted by their portfolio weights in accordance with the fund\u2019s strategic asset allocation.\nThe components of net periodic pension costs were as follows:\nThe components of net periodic pension cost other than the service cost component are included in Other financial income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe estimated net actuarial loss (gain) and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next year (2020) are $3 million and $0 respectively.\nPlan assets\nThe actual pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\nWe met our target plan asset allocation. The investment objectives for the pension plan assets are designed to generate returns that, along with the future contributions, will enable the pension plans to meet their future obligations. The investments in our major defined benefit plans largely consist of government bonds, \u201cLevel 2\u201d Corporate Bonds and cash to mitigate the risk of interest fluctuations. The asset mix of equity, bonds, cash and other categories is evaluated by an asset-liability modeling study for our largest plan. The assets of funded plans in other countries mostly have a large proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are\naligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. Total pension plan assets of $203 million include $180 million related to the German and Japanese pension funds.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of these assets.\nThe Company currently expects to make $14 million of employer contributions to defined-benefit pension plans and $9 million of expected cash payments in relation to unfunded pension plans in 2020.\nEstimated future pension benefit payments\nThe following benefit payments are expected to be made (including those for funded plans):\nPostretirement health care benefits\nIn addition to providing pension benefits, NXP provides retiree healthcare benefits in the US which are accounted for as defined-benefit plans. In 2016, NXP also provided retiree healthcare benefits in the U.K. The liability associated with the U.K. benefits was divested in association with the sale of Standard Products during 2017.\nThe accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at the end of 2019 equals $9 million (2018: $11 million).\nNote 14 - Debt\nShort-term debt\n(*)\nNet of adjustment for debt issuance costs.\nLong-term debt\nThe following table summarizes the outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)\nWe do not have any borrowings under the $1,500 million Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the following principal amounts of long-term debt are due in the next 5 years:\nAs of December 31, 2019, the book value of our outstanding long-term debt was $7,400 million, less debt issuance costs of $33 million and original issuance/debt discount of $2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no aggregate principal amount of variable interest rate indebtedness under our loan agreements. The remaining tenor of unsecured debt is on average 4.7 years.\nAccrued interest as of December 31, 2019 is $52 million (December 31, 2018: $31 million).\n2019 Financing Activities\n2024 Revolving Credit Facility\nOn June 11, 2019, NXP B.V. together with NXP Funding LLC, entered into a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility agreement, replacing the $600 million secured revolving credit facility, entered into on December 7, 2015.\n2020 Senior Notes\nOn June 11, 2019, NXP B.V. together with NXP Funding LLC, commenced a cash tender offer for any and all of their $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 4.125% Senior Notes due 2020 (\u201c4.125% 2020 Notes\u201d). An amount of $553 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.125% 2020 Notes were tendered in this offer and retired on June 18, 2019. The remaining $47 million were redeemed under the terms of the indenture governing these notes on July 3, 2019.\n2026 and 2029 Senior Unsecured Notes\nOn June 18, 2019, NXP B.V., together with NXP USA Inc. and NXP Funding LLC, issued $750 million of 3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 and $1 billion of 4.3% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029. NXP used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of these notes to repay in full, the 2020 Senior Notes, as described above. The remaining proceeds were used to refinance the $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of Cash Convertible Notes due 2019 issued by NXP Semiconductors N.V. on December 1, 2014 upon the maturity of these notes on December 1, 2019.\n2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes\nOn December 2, 2019, NXP repaid the Cash Convertible Notes upon their maturity through a combination of available cash and payments made by the counterparties under privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the \u201cCash Convertible Notes Hedges\u201d), as further described in Note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.\nCertain terms and Covenants of the notes\nThe Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes.\nThe indentures governing the notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company\u2019s ability and that of restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; enter into agreements that restrict\ndividends from restricted subsidiaries; sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; and effect a consolidation or merger. The Company has been in compliance with any such indentures and financing covenants.\nNo portion of long-term and short-term debt as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 has been secured by collateral on substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets and of certain of its subsidiaries.\nWe are in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of December 31, 2019.\n2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes\nIn November 2014, NXP issued $1,150 million principal amount of its 2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The 2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes had a stated interest rate of 1.00% payable June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2015. The initial purchasers\u2019 transaction fees and expenses totaling $16 million were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are amortized over the term of the 2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes using the effective interest method. The Cash Convertible Notes matured on December 1, 2019. All of the holders elected to convert their Cash Convertible Notes for settlement on December 2, 2019, and none of the Cash Convertible Notes were repurchased or converted into cash prior to such date.\nThe cash conversion feature of the Cash Convertible Notes was a derivative liability that required bifurcation from the Cash Convertible Notes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging\" (\"ASC Topic 815\"), and was carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in other (expense) income, net. The initial fair value liability of the embedded cash conversion option simultaneously reduced the carrying value of the Cash Convertible Notes (effectively an original issuance discount). The embedded cash conversion option is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis, within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the embedded cash conversion option at December 31, 2018 was $24 million which is recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in the fair value of the embedded cash conversion option resulted in a profit of $24 million (2018: a profit of $277 million).\nIn connection with the issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the \"Cash Convertible Notes Hedges\"), whereby NXP had the option to receive the cash amount that may be due to the Notes holders at maturity in excess of the $1,150 million principal amount of the notes, subject to certain conversion rate adjustments in the Notes Indenture. These were cash settled in the fourth quarter. The Cash Convertible Notes Hedges were recorded as a derivative asset under ASC Topic 815 and were carried at fair value. See Note 21 for additional information regarding the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges and the Cash Conversion Derivative and their fair values.\nOn December 2, 2019, we repaid the $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of the Cash Convertible Notes using available cash. In addition, on December 1, 2019 we settled the Cash Conversion Derivative of $144 million, which was fully funded by payments made by the counterparties for the settlement of the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges.\nIn separate transactions, NXP also sold warrants, to various parties for the purchase of up to 11.18 million shares of NXP\u2019s common stock at an initial strike price of $133.32 per share in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The warrants expire on various dates ranging from March 2, 2020 to May 26, 2020, and will be net share settled. Under the terms of the warrants, the calculation agency may adjust certain terms of its warrants upon the announcement, termination or occurrence of certain events, including the payment of cash dividends. The warrant transactions may also be terminated if the calculation agent determines that no such adjustment will produce a commercially reasonable result, and that the relevant event is reasonably likely to occur. As a result of the payment of cash dividends, the terms of the warrants have been adjusted, resulting in the right to purchase up to 11.38 million shares of NXP's common stock at an adjusted strike price of $130.99 per share, as of December 31, 2019. Any additional adjustment in the future may increase our delivery obligations upon expiration and settlement of the warrants or our obligations upon their cancellation, termination or unwinding, which would be settled using shares of our\nstock. NXP received $134 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the Warrants, which were at the time of issuance recorded in Other non-current liabilities. As of January 1, 2016, as of result of the acquisition of Freescale, NXP has concluded that the functional currency of the holding company is USD. Consequently, beginning from January 1, 2016, the Warrants with a carrying value of $168 million were reclassified to stockholders\u2019 equity, and mark-to-market accounting is no longer applicable. The Warrants are included in diluted earnings per share to the extent the impact is dilutive. As of December 31, 2019, the Warrants were not dilutive.\nThe principal amount, unamortized debt discount and net carrying amount of the liability component of the 2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes as of December 31, 2018 was as follows:\nThe effective interest rate, contractual interest expense and amortization of debt discount for the 2019 Cash Convertible Senior Notes for fiscal 2018 were as follows:\nNote 15 - Leases\nOperating and finance lease assets relate to buildings (corporate offices, research and development and manufacturing facilities and datacenters), land, machinery and installations and other equipment (vehicles and certain office equipment). These leases, except for land leases, have remaining lease terms of 1 to 30 years (land leases 48 to 90 years), some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. As of December 31, 2019, assets recorded under finance leases amounted to $82 million and accumulated depreciation associated with finance leases was $9 million.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows\nFuture minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2019 were as follows:\nRent expense amounted to $12 million in 2019 (containing as from 2019 only services related to leased assets as well as short-term leases) compared to $57 million and $63 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively (containing all leases of land and buildings and other equipment as well as related services).\nLease liabilities related to leases are split between current and non-current:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets are $226 million as of December 31, 2019 and are included in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet.\nNote 16 - Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company maintains purchase commitments with certain suppliers, primarily for raw materials, semi-finished goods and manufacturing services and for some non-production items. Purchase commitments for inventory materials are generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary for different suppliers. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments of $290 million, which are due through 2044.\nLitigation\nWe are regularly involved as plaintiffs or defendants in claims and litigation relating to a variety of matters such as contractual disputes, personal injury claims, employee grievances and intellectual property litigation. In addition, our acquisitions, divestments and financial transactions sometimes result in, or are followed by, claims or litigation. Some of these claims may possibly be recovered from insurance reimbursements. Although the ultimate disposition of asserted claims cannot be predicted with certainty, it is our belief that the outcome of any such claims, either individually or on a combined basis, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, such outcomes may be material to our consolidated statement of operations for a particular period. The Company records an accrual for any claim that arises whenever it considers that it is probable that it is exposed to a loss contingency and the amount of the loss contingency can be reasonably estimated. Legal fees are expensed when incurred.\nBased on the most current information available to it and based on its best estimate, the Company also reevaluates at least on a quarterly basis the claims that have arisen to determine whether any new accruals need to be made or whether any accruals made need to be adjusted. Based on the procedures described above, the Company has an aggregate amount of $44 million accrued for potential and current legal proceedings pending as of December 31, 2019, compared to $123 million accrued at December 31, 2018 (without reduction for any related insurance reimbursements). The accruals are included in \u201cOther current liabilities\u201d and \u201cOther non-current liabilities\u201d. As of December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s balance related to insurance reimbursements was $25 million (December 31, 2018: $65 million) and is included in \u201cOther current assets\u201d and \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d.\nThe Company also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the amount accrued based on currently available information for those cases for which such estimate can be made. The estimated aggregate range requires significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants (including the Company) in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the claims, and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate. As at December 31, 2019, the Company believes that for all litigation pending its potential aggregate exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued (without reduction for any amounts that may possibly be recovered under insurance programs) could range between $0 and $66 million. Based upon our past experience with these matters, the Company would expect to receive\ninsurance reimbursement on certain of these claims that would offset the potential maximum exposure of up to $53 million.\nIn addition, the Company is currently assisting Motorola in the defense of personal injury lawsuits due to indemnity obligations included in the agreement that separated Freescale from Motorola in 2004. The multi-plaintiff Motorola lawsuits are pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. These claims allege a link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room facilities and birth defects in 23 individuals. The Motorola suits allege exposures between 1965 and 2006. Each claim seeks an unspecified amount of damages for the alleged injuries; however, legal counsel representing the plaintiffs has indicated they will seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages from Motorola for the entire inventory of claims which, if proven and recovered, the Company considers to be material. A portion of any indemnity due to Motorola will be reimbursed to NXP if Motorola receives an indemnification payment from its insurance coverage. Motorola has potential insurance coverage for many of the years indicated above, but with differing types and levels of coverage, self-insurance retention amounts and deductibles. We are in discussions with Motorola and their insurers regarding the availability of applicable insurance coverage for each of the individual cases. Motorola and NXP have denied liability for these alleged injuries based on numerous defenses.\nEnvironmental remediation\nIn each jurisdiction in which we operate, we are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations.\nAs with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property, the Company faces inherent risks of environmental liability at our current and historical manufacturing facilities. Certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. Certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated.\nSoil and groundwater contamination has been identified at our properties in Nijmegen, the Netherlands and near Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The remediation processes at these locations are expected to continue for many years.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have recorded $90 million for environmental remediation costs, which are primarily included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. This amount represents the undiscounted future cash flows of our estimated share of costs incurred in environmental cleanup sites without considering recovery of costs from any other party or insurer, since in most cases potentially responsible parties other than us may exist and be held responsible.\nNote 17 - Stockholders\u2019 Equity and Earnings per Share\nThe share capital of the Company as of December 31, 2019 consists of 1,076,257,500 authorized shares, including 430,503,000 authorized shares of common stock, and 645,754,500 authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.\nEffective July 26, 2018, the board of directors of NXP, as authorized by its annual general meeting of shareholders (the \u201cAGM\u201d), authorized the repurchase of $5 billion of the Company\u2019s stock for a period of 18 months. In October 2018, the board of directors of NXP authorized the additional repurchase of shares up to a maximum 20% (approximately 69 million shares) of the number of shares issued. As of year-end 2018, NXP repurchased 54.4 million shares, for a total of approximately $5 billion, of which a number of 17,300,143 shares had been cancelled. Effective June 17, 2019, the board of directors of NXP, as authorized by its annual general meeting of shareholders (the \u201cAGM\u201d), renewed and revised this authorization for a period of 18 months to repurchase ordinary shares up to the statutory limit. During the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2019, NXP repurchased 15.9 million shares, for a total of approximately $1.4 billion, of which a number of 13,183,081\nshares had been cancelled. As a result, the number of issued NXP shares as per November 27, 2019 is 315,519,638 shares. At December 31, 2019, the Company has issued and paid up 315,519,638 shares (2018: 328,702,719 shares) of common stock each having a par value of \u20ac0.20 or a nominal stock capital of \u20ac63 million (2018: \u20ac66 million).\nCash dividends\nThe following dividends were declared in 2019 and 2018 under NXP\u2019s quarterly dividend program which was introduced as of the third quarter of 2018:\nShare-based awards\nThe Company has granted share-based awards to the members of our board of directors, management team, our other executives, selected other key employees/talents of NXP and selected new hires to receive the Company\u2019s shares in the future. See Note 18, \u201cShare-based Compensation\u201d.\nTreasury shares\nFrom time to time, last on June 17, 2019, the General Meeting of Shareholders authorizes the Board of Directors to repurchase shares of our common stock. On that basis, for the first time in 2011 and latest effective November 19, 2019, the Board of Directors executed various share repurchase programs. In accordance with the Company\u2019s policy to provide share-based awards from its treasury share inventory, shares which have been repurchased and are held in treasury for delivery upon exercise of options and under restricted and performance share programs, are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders\u2019 equity. Treasury shares are recorded at cost, representing the market price on the acquisition date. When issued, shares are removed from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.\nDifferences between the cost and the proceeds received when treasury shares are reissued, are recorded in capital in excess of par value. Deficiencies in excess of net gains arising from previous treasury share issuances are charged to retained earnings.\nThe following transactions took place resulting from employee option and share plans:\nShareholder tax on repurchased shares\nUnder Dutch tax law, the repurchase of a company\u2019s shares by an entity in the Netherlands is a taxable event (unless exemptions apply). The tax on the repurchased shares is attributed to the shareholders, with NXP making the payment on the shareholders\u2019 behalf. As such, the tax on the repurchased shares is accounted for within stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe computation of earnings per share (EPS) is presented in the following table:\n1)\nStock options to purchase up to 0.1 million shares of NXP\u2019s common stock that were outstanding in 2019 (2018: 0.1 million shares; 2017: 0.1 million shares) were anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common stock or the number of shares assumed to be repurchased using the proceeds of unrecognized compensation expense and exercise prices was greater than the weighted average number of shares underlying outstanding stock options.\n2)\nUnvested RSU\u2019s, PSU\u2019s and equity rights of 0.7 million shares that were outstanding in 2019 (2018: 0.9 million shares; 2017: 0.7 million shares) were anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the number of shares assumed to be repurchased using the proceeds of unrecognized compensation expense was greater than the weighted average number of outstanding unvested RSU\u2019s, PSU\u2019s and equity rights or the performance goal has not been met.\n3)\nWarrants to purchase up to 11.4 million shares of NXP's common stock at the price of $130.99 per share were outstanding in 2019 (2018: 11.2 million shares at a price of $132.55; 2017: 11.2 million shares at a price of $133.32). Upon exercise, the warrants will be net share settled. At the end of 2019, 2018 and 2017, the warrants were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the warrants\u2019 exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares.\nNote 18 - Share-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense is included in the following line items in our statement of operations:\nThe income tax (expense) benefit recognized in net income related to share-based compensation expenses was $27 million (includes $3 million of excess tax benefits), $27 million (includes $4 million of excess tax benefits) and $51 million (includes $27 million of excess tax benefits) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nLong Term Incentive Plans (LTIP\u2019s)\nThe LTIP was introduced in 2010 and is a broad-based long-term retention program to attract, retain and motivate talented employees as well as align stockholder and employee interests. The LTIP provides share-based compensation (\u201cawards\u201d) to both our eligible employees and non-employee directors. Awards that may be granted include performance shares, stock options and restricted shares. On October 29, 2019, the Company granted PSU awards to certain executives of the Company with a performance measure of Relative Total Shareholder Return (\u201cRelative TSR\u201d). Each PSU, which cliff vests on the third anniversary of the date of grant, entitles the grant recipient to receive from 0 to 2 common shares for each of the target units awarded based on the Relative TSR of the Company's share price as compared to a set of peer companies. The Company estimates the fair value of the PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model, utilizing assumptions underlying the Black-Scholes methodology. The grant date fair value was $142.41 per PSU. The fair value of the PSUs is recognized as compensation cost over the service period of 3 years. Awards granted generally will become fully vested upon a termination event occurring within one year following a change in control, as defined. A termination event is defined as either termination of employment or services other than for cause or constructive termination of resulting from a significant reduction in either the nature or scope of duties and responsibilities, a reduction in compensation or a required relocation. The number of shares authorized and available for awards at December 31, 2019 was 29.2 million.\nA charge of $339 million was recorded in 2019 for the LTIP (2018: $307 million; 2017: $272 million).\nA summary of the activity for our LTIP\u2019s during 2019 is presented below.\nStock options\nThe options have a strike price equal to the closing share price on the grant date. The fair value of the options has been calculated using the Black-Scholes formula, using the following assumptions:\n\u2022\nan expected life varying from 5.76 to 6.25 years, calculated in accordance with the guidance provided in SEC Staff bulletin No. 110 for plain vanilla options using the simplified method, since our equity shares have been publicly traded for only a limited period of time and we do not have sufficient historical exercise data at the grant date of the options;\n\u2022\na risk-free interest rate varying from 1.0% to 1.9% (2018: 0.8% to 2.1%; 2017: 0.8% to 2.8%);\n\u2022\nno expected dividend payments; and\n\u2022\na volatility of 42 - 45% based on the volatility of a set of peer companies. Peer company data has been used given the short period of time our shares have been publicly traded.\nAbove assumptions were valid at the moment NXP granted option. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.\nNo options were granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe intrinsic value of the exercised options was $48 million (2018: $59 million; 2017: $311 million), whereas the amount received by NXP was $45 million (2018: $30 million; 2017: $137 million). The tax benefit\nrealized from stock options exercised during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $31 million, $34 million, and $83 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, there were no (2018: $7 million) unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options (2018 cost expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.8 years).\nPerformance share units\nFinancial performance conditions\nIn 2019, the weighted average grant date fair value of performance share units granted was $141.64 (2018: $121.18; 2017: no PSU\u2019s granted).\nMarket performance conditions\nNo performance share units vested in 2019 (the fair value of the performance share units at the time of vesting in 2018: $6 million; 2017: $39 million).\nAt December 31, 2019, there was a total of $135 million (2018: $143 million; 2017: $4 million) of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance share units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years (2018: 2.6 years; 2017: 1.3 years).\nRestricted share units\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of restricted share units granted in 2019 was $111.62 (2018: $84.77; 2017: $115.05). The fair value of the restricted share units at the time of vesting was $325 million (2018: $263 million; 2017: $328 million).\nAt December 31, 2019, there was a total of $501 million (2018: $484 million; 2017: $483 million) of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted share units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years (2018: 1.5 years; 2017: 1.6 years).\nManagement Equity Stock Option Plan (\u201cMEP\u201d)\nAwards are no longer available under these plans. Current employees who owned vested MEP Options could have exercised such MEP Options during the five-year period subsequent to September 18, 2013, subject to these employees remaining employed by us and subject to the applicable laws and regulations.\nNo charge was recorded in 2019, 2018 and 2017 for options granted under the MEP. No MEP Options were outstanding as of December 31, 2019 (2018: no options outstanding; 2017: 231,924 vested options with a weighted average exercise price of \u20ac35.72).\nThe intrinsic value of exercised options was $16 million in 2018 and $206 million in 2017, whereas the amount received by NXP was $9 million in 2018 and $60 million in 2017.\nNote 19 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nTotal comprehensive income (loss) represents net income (loss) plus the results of certain equity changes not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The after-tax components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and their corresponding changes are shown below:\nNote 20 - Related-party Transactions\nThe Company\u2019s related parties are the members of the board of directors of NXP Semiconductors N.V., the members of the management team of NXP Semiconductors N.V. and equity-accounted investees and, up to July 26, 2018, Qualcomm Incorporated. As of the divestment of the SP business on February 7, 2017, the newly formed Nexperia has become a related party.\nWe have a number of strategic alliances and joint ventures. We have relationships with certain of our alliance partners in the ordinary course of business whereby we enter into various sale and purchase transactions, generally on terms comparable to transactions with third parties. However, in certain instances upon divestment of former businesses where we enter into supply arrangements with the former owned business, sales are conducted at cost.\nThe following table presents the amounts related to revenue and other income and purchase of goods and services incurred in transactions with these related parties:\nThe following table presents the amounts related to receivable and payable balances with these related parties:\nAs part of the divestment of the SP business, we entered into a lease commitment and related services to Nexperia, that is $64 million as of December 31, 2019, and committed $50 million to an investment fund\naffiliated with Nexperia\u2019s owners. The lease commitments are reflected in our recorded lease liabilities in other current and non-current liabilities.\nNote 21 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value and carrying amount of our financial instruments measured on a recurring basis:\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nInvestments in money market funds (as part of our cash and cash equivalents) have fair value measurements which are all based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nOther financial assets and derivatives\nFor other financial assets and derivatives the fair value is based upon significant other observable inputs depending on the nature of the other financial asset and derivative.\nNotes hedges and Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative\nThe Notes hedges and the Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative, which were settled along with the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Cash Convertible Notes, are measured at fair value using level 3 inputs. The instruments are not actively traded and are valued at the measurement date using an option pricing model that uses observable inputs for the share price of NXP\u2019s common stock, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and the term, in combination with a significant unobservable input for volatility. Volatility has historically been determined by a hypothetical market place. The volatility factor utilized at December 31, 2018 was 34.8%. The change in the fair value of the Notes hedges and Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative was solely the gain and loss, respectively for each instrument that was recognized.\nDebt\nThe fair value is estimated on the basis of observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities for certain issues, or on the basis of discounted cash flow analyses. Accrued interest is included under accrued liabilities and not within the carrying amount or estimated fair value of debt.\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nWe measure and record our non-marketable equity investments (non-marketable equity method and cost method investments) and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, at fair value when an impairment charge is required.\nNote 22 - Other Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Currency Risk\nWe conduct business in diverse markets around the world and employ a variety of risk management strategies and techniques to manage foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. One way we achieve this is through the active hedging of risks through the selective use of derivative instruments.\nDerivatives are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value which fluctuates based on changing market conditions.\nThe Company does not purchase or hold financial derivative instruments for trading purposes.\nCurrency risk\nThe Company\u2019s transactions are denominated in a variety of currencies. The Company uses financial instruments to reduce its exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s organizations identify and measure their exposures from transactions denominated in other than their own functional currency. We calculate our net exposure on a cash flow basis considering balance sheet items, actual orders received or made and anticipated revenue and expenses. The Company generally hedges foreign currency exposures in relation to transaction exposures, such as receivables/payables resulting from such transactions and part of anticipated sales and purchases. The Company generally uses forwards to hedge these exposures. As of January 1, 2016, as a result of the acquisition of Freescale, NXP has concluded that the functional currency of the holding company is USD. Beginning from January 1, 2016, our U.S. dollar-denominated notes and short term loans will no longer need to be re-measured. Prior to January 1, 2016, the U.S. dollar-denominated debt held by our Dutch subsidiary (which had at that time a euro functional currency) could have generated adverse currency results in financial income and expenses depending on the exchange rate movement between the euro and the U.S. dollar. This exposure was partially mitigated by the application of net investment hedge accounting, which had been applied since May 2011. The U.S. dollar exposure of the net investment in U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries was hedged by certain of our U.S. dollar denominated debt. The hedging relationship was assumed to be highly effective. Foreign currency gains or losses on this U.S. dollar debt that were recorded in a euro functional currency entity that were designated as, and to the extent they were effective, as a hedge of the net investment in our U.S. dollar foreign entities, were reported as a translation adjustment in other comprehensive income within equity, and offset in whole or in part the foreign currency changes to the net investment that were also reported in other comprehensive income. Absent the application of net investment hedging, these amounts would have been recorded as a loss within financial income (expense) in the statement of operations.\nNote 23 - Segments and Geographical Information\nAs discussed in Note 1, we changed our reporting segments to better align with our organizational structure and with the way our chief operating decision maker makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the business.\nRevenue attributed to geographic areas is based on the customer\u2019s shipped-to location (except for intellectual property license revenue which is attributable to the Netherlands). Long-lived assets include Property and equipment, net, which were based on the physical location of the assets as of the end of each year.\nGeographical Information\nNote 24 - Subsequent Events\nOn February 3, 2020, NXP completed the sale of the Company's Voice and Audio Solutions (VAS) assets, pursuant to the definitive agreement dated August 16, 2019, with Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co., Ltd. (\"Goodix\") from China, for a net cash amount of $161 million inclusive of final working capital adjustments.\nSupplementary Financial Data (unaudited)\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nFinancial Information by Quarter (unaudited)",

Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and included controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance, regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on the criteria established in \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\u201d by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.\nIt should be noted that any control system, regardless of how well it is designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Control systems can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. In addition, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nThe Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG Accountants N.V., has issued an audit report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2019, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",
