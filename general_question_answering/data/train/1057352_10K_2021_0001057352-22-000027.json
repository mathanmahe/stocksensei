    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nIn this report, the words \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cCoStar Group\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d refer to CoStar Group, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. This report also refers to our websites, but information contained on those sites is not part of this report.\nCoStar Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, founded in 1987, is a leading provider of online real estate marketplaces, information and analytics in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) based on the fact that we own and operate leading online marketplaces for commercial real estate and apartment listings in the U.S., based on the numbers of unique visitors and site visits per month; provide more information, analytics and marketing services than any of our competitors; offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available; and have the largest commercial real estate research department in the industry. We have created and compiled a standardized platform of information, analytics and online marketplace services where industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate, including apartments, and the related business communities, can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently accessing and exchanging accurate and standardized real estate-related information. Our service offerings span all commercial property types, including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, commercial land, mixed-use and hospitality. With our recent acquisitions of Homesnap, Inc., (\u201cHomesnap\u201d) and Homes Group, LLC (\u201cHomes.com\u201d) we also offer online platforms that manage workflow and marketing for residential real estate agents and brokers and provide residential property listings for homebuyers.\nWe manage our business geographically in two operating segments, with our primary areas of measurement and decision-making being North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, and International, which primarily includes Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Our most recent strategic acquisitions include Homesnap\u00ae (acquired in December 2020); Homes.com\u00ae (acquired in May 2021) and Comreal Info, a French soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par actions simplifi\u00e9e (\"BureauxLocaux\"), the owner and operator of BureauxLocaux, a commercial real estate digital marketplace, in France (acquired in October 2021). See Notes 5 and 9 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these acquisitions.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to provide real estate industry professionals and consumers with critical knowledge to explore and complete transactions by offering the most comprehensive, timely and standardized information on real estate and the right tools to be able to effectively utilize that information. Over time, we have expanded, and we continue to expand, our services for real estate information, analytics and online marketplaces in an effort to continue to meet the needs of the industry as it grows and evolves.\nOur standardized platform includes the most comprehensive proprietary database of commercial real estate information in the industry; the largest research department in the commercial real estate industry; proprietary data collection, information management and quality control systems; a large in-house product development team; a broad suite of web-based information, analytics and online marketplace services; a large team of analysts and economists; and a large, diverse base of clients. Our database has been developed and enhanced for more than 30 years by a research department that makes daily database updates. In addition to our internal efforts to grow the database, we have obtained and assimilated a number of proprietary databases. Our comprehensive commercial real estate database powers our information services, sources data used in our analytic services and provides content for most of our online marketplace services and our auction platform. Our ability to utilize the same commercial real estate information across our standardized platform creates efficiencies in operations and improves data quality for our customers.\nWe deliver our comprehensive commercial real estate information content to our North American and European customers primarily via an integrated solution of online service offerings that includes information about space available for-lease,\ncomparable sales information, information about properties for-sale, tenant information, internet marketing services, analytical capabilities, information for clients\u2019 websites, information about industry professionals and their business relationships, data integration and industry news. We also operate complementary online marketplaces for commercial and residential real estate listings and apartment rentals, as well as a commercial real estate auction platform. We strive to cross-sell our services to our customers in order to best suit their needs.\nInformation about our revenues, long-lived assets and total assets derived from and located in foreign countries is included in Notes 2, 3 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues; net income before interest and other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d); and total assets and liabilities for each of our segments are set forth in Notes 3 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information about risks associated with our foreign operations is included in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur primary brands include CoStar\u00ae, Apartments.comTM, LoopNet\u00ae, STR\u00ae, Ten-X\u00ae, BizBuySell\u00ae, LandsofAmericaTM, Homes.com\u00ae., and Homesnap\u00ae Our services are accessible via the internet and through our mobile applications.\nCoStar is our subscription-based integrated platform for commercial real estate intelligence, which includes information about office, industrial, retail, multifamily, hospitality and student housing properties, properties for sale, comparable sales, tenants, space available for lease, industry professionals and their business relationships, industry news and market and lease analytical capabilities. CoStar is our largest service offering in our North America and International operating segments.\nApartments.com is the flagship brand in our network of apartment marketing sites, which also includes ApartmentFinder.comTM, ForRent.com\u00ae, ApartmentHomeLiving.comTM, WestsideRentals.com\u00ae, AFTER55.com\u00ae, CorporateHousing.comTM, ForRentUniversity.com\u00ae, Apartamentos.comTM, which is our apartment-listing site offered exclusively in Spanish, and Off Campus Partners, which provides student housing marketplace content and powers off campus housing sites for many universities across the U.S. Our apartment marketing network of subscription-based advertising services provides property owners, professional property management companies and landlords with a comprehensive advertising destination for their available rental units and offers renters a platform for searching for available rentals. Our apartment marketing network draws on and leverages our multifamily database, which contains detailed information on apartment properties and is designed to meet renter preferences and demands, in order to drive traffic to those sites and attract advertisers who prefer to advertise on heavily trafficked apartment websites. Our network of apartment marketing sites provides a comprehensive selection of rentals, information on actual availabilities and rents and in-depth data on neighborhoods, including restaurants, nightlife, history, schools and other facts important to renters. To help renters find the information that meets their needs, our sites also offer innovative search tools such as the PolygonTM Search tool, which allow renters to specifically define the area in which they want to find an apartment and Plan Commute tools, which allow renters to search property listings that meet their transportation needs. We also offer complementary services to the rental industry, including the ability for renters to apply for rentals online and for landlords to receive applications, screen tenants and process rental payments and lease renewals.\nLoopNet is the flagship brand in our network of commercial real estate marketing sites, which also includes CityFeet.com\u00ae, Showcase.com\u00ae. Our LoopNet online marketplace enables commercial property owners, landlords and real estate brokers working on their behalf to advertise properties for-sale or for-lease and to submit detailed information about property listings. Commercial real estate brokers, buyers and tenants use LoopNet extensively to search for available property listings that meet their criteria. LoopNet offers unique, subscription-based advertising solutions for different segments within the industry and delivers value across its constituent networks. The LoopNet network leverages CoStar\u2019s commercial real estate database to provide in-depth and accurate information across all commercial property types, including office, industrial, retail, multifamily, specialty, health care, hospitality, sports and entertainment, land and residential. Investors and tenants are also able to consume industry news developed by our in-house editorial team.\nThe acquisitions of Homes.com and Homesnap enabled us to expand our offerings to the residential for sale market. Homes.com is a homes for sale listings site. Homesnap is an online and mobile software platform that provides subscription-based access to applications that manage residential real estate agent workflow and marketing campaigns delivered on third-party platforms. Homesnap also receives transaction-based revenue for short-term advertising delivered on third-party platforms. In October 2021, Homesnap reached an agreement to create, maintain and market a consumer-facing search website and mobile app for the Real Estate Board of New York's Residential Listing Service. Homesnap will provide a custom version of its platform, branded as Citysnap\u2122, specifically for the five boroughs of New York City. Our residential team is creating new and improved tools to help agents promote their residential listings, connect with buyers and sellers and streamline their daily workflow.\nTen-X operates an online auction platform for commercial real estate. Our platform provides brokers, sellers, and buyers access to data-driven technology and marketing tools to expand market visibility and decrease time to close. The platform allows brokers and sellers to onboard assets, evaluate the results of complimentary marketing campaigns and follow up on pre-qualified leads. Buyers can search for properties that meet their investment goals and are given access to market analysis and due diligence documents.\nOur BizBuySell\u00ae services, which include BizQuest\u00ae and FindaFranchise, provide an online marketplace for businesses and franchises for-sale. Our LandsofAmerica services, which include LandAndFarm\u00ae and LandWatch.com\u00ae, provide an online marketplace for rural lands for-sale and are also accessible via our Land.com domain.\nWe also provide other services that complement those offered by our primary brands. These include: real estate and lease management technology solutions, lease administration, transaction and project management and lease accounting, through our CoStar Real Estate Manager service offerings; market research, consulting and analysis, portfolio and debt analysis and management and reporting capabilities through our CoStar Investment Analysis and CoStar Risk Analytics service offerings; and benchmarking and analytics for the hospitality industry through our STR offerings.\nOur services are typically distributed to our clients under subscription-based license agreements that typically renew automatically, a majority of which have a term of at least one year. Upon renewal, many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations. To encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based services rather than charging fees based on actual platform usage or number of paid clicks. Depending on the type of service, contract rates are generally based on the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client's business focus, the client's geographic location, the number and types of services to which a client subscribes, the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a client's advertised properties in the search results. Our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis. Our transaction-based services primarily consist of auction fees from our Ten-X online auction platform for commercial real estate, which are generally calculated as a percentage of the final sales price for the commercial real estate property sold and recognized as revenue upon the successful closure of an auction. We generally see higher sales of Apartments.com listing services during the peak summer rental season and higher CoStar sales towards the end of the year, however sales fluctuate from year-to-year and revenue is not generally seasonal because our services are typically sold on a subscription basis.\nExpansion and Growth\nAcquisitions\nWe have expanded and continue to expand the coverage and depth of our information, analytics and online marketplace services. In addition to organic growth, we have grown our business through strategic acquisitions. On May 24, 2021, we acquired Homes.com. On October 1, 2021, we acquired Comreal Info, the owner and operator of BureauxLocaux, a leading commercial real estate digital marketplace in France. We continue to integrate our recent acquisitions and the services they offer into our CoStar network. See Notes 5 and 9 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these acquisitions.\nDevelopment, Investments and Expansion\nWe plan to continue to invest in our business and our services, evaluate strategic growth opportunities and pursue our key priorities as described below in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, while we continue to monitor the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and manage our response. We are committed to supporting, improving and enhancing our information, analytics and online marketplace solutions, including expanding and improving our offerings for property owners, property managers, brokers, agents, buyers, commercial tenants and residential renters and homebuyers. We expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, integrate and cross-sell services and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research, sales and marketing organizations. We reevaluate our priorities on a regular basis and may reevaluate our priorities as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve.\nWe evaluate potential changes to our service offerings from time to time in order to better align the services we offer with customers\u2019 needs. Further, in some cases, when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry and client needs, we may decide to combine, shift focus from, de-emphasize, phase out, or eliminate a service that, among other things, overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer. In the event that we eliminate or phase out particular service offerings, we may experience reduced revenues and earnings. The decision to eliminate or phase out a service offering may also ultimately\nresult in increased revenues and earnings from sales of other services we offer in lieu of the eliminated or phased out services. However, we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of any reductions in revenues and earnings or subsequent increases in revenues and earnings, if any, resulting from the elimination or phasing out of any service offering.\nWe believe that our integration efforts and continued investments in our services, including acquisitions and expansion of our existing service offerings, have created a platform for long-term revenue growth. We expect these investments to result in further penetration of our subscription-based services and the successful cross-selling of our services to customers in existing markets.\nWe have invested in the expansion and development of our field sales force to support the growth and expansion of our company and our service offering and plan to continue to invest in, evaluate and strategically position our sales force as we continue to develop and grow. In addition, we continue to invest in marketing our services, as well as in our research operations to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings to meet the growing content needs of our clients. We plan to continue to utilize multi-channel marketing campaigns and to work to determine the optimal level of marketing investments for our services for future periods. While we believe the investments we make in our business create a platform for growth, those investments may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our near-term financial position.\nIndustry Overview\nThe market for real estate information and analysis is vast based on the variety, volume and value of transactions related to real estate. Each transaction has multiple participants and multiple information requirements and in order to facilitate transactions, industry participants must have extensive, accurate and current information and analysis. Members of the real estate and related business community require daily access to current data such as space availability, properties for-sale, rental units available, rental rates, vacancy rates, tenant movements, sales comparables, supply, new construction, absorption rates and other important market developments to carry out their businesses effectively. Market research (including historical and forecast conditions) and applied analytics are instrumental to the success of industry participants. There is a strong need for an efficient marketplace, where real estate professionals can exchange information, evaluate opportunities using standardized data and interpretive analyses and interact with each other on a continuous basis.\nA large number of parties involved in commercial and residential real estate and the related business community make use of the services we provide in order to obtain information they need to conduct their businesses, including:\n\u2022 Sales and leasing brokers \u2022 Government agencies\n\u2022 Property owners \u2022 Mortgage-backed security issuers\n\u2022 Property managers \u2022 Appraisers\n\u2022 Design and construction professionals \u2022 Pension fund managers\n\u2022 Real estate developers \u2022 Reporters\n\u2022 Real estate investment trust managers \u2022 Tenant vendors\n\u2022 Investment and commercial bankers \u2022 Building services vendors\n\u2022 Mortgage bankers \u2022 Communications providers\n\u2022 Mortgage brokers \u2022 Insurance companies\u2019 managers\n\u2022 Retailers \u2022 Institutional advisors\n\u2022 Hospitality owners \u2022 Investors and asset managers\n\u2022 Real estate agents\nThe commercial real estate and related business community historically operated in an inefficient marketplace because of the fragmented approach to gathering and exchanging information within the marketplace. Various organizations, including hundreds of brokerage firms, directory publishers and local research companies, collected data on specific markets and developed software to analyze the information they independently gathered. This highly fragmented methodology resulted in duplication of efforts in the collection and analysis of information, excessive internal cost and the creation of non-standardized data containing varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness, resulting in a formidable information gap.\nThe creation and maintenance of a standardized information platform for commercial real estate requires infrastructure including a standardized database, accurate and comprehensive research capabilities, experienced analysts, easy to use technology and intensive participant interaction. By combining our extensive database, researchers, our experienced team of analysts and economists, technological expertise and broad customer base, we believe that we have created such a platform.\nThe apartment rental advertising industry serves property managers and owners who are tasked with finding renters to occupy vacant apartments, as well as renters who are searching for their next home. Property managers have several options at their disposal, including their own websites, drive-by and outdoor advertising, traditional classified ads, free online listing services, search engine marketing and internet listings services (\u201cILS\u201d), like Apartments.com and the network of apartment listing websites we own and operate. Many apartment ILS websites feature only the rental availabilities that larger property owners pay to advertise, resulting in a poor user experience in which the renter\u2019s search criteria return either limited or no results, irrelevant results or stale results that do not represent actual availabilities.\nWe believe that consumers expect accurate, actionable and comprehensive apartment rental information. Our apartment ILS websites include renter-focused features like the ability to filter search results according to various criteria (e.g., commute time to work); professional images of the properties, including immersive videos and 3-D interactive models; custom neighborhood profiles; and tenant reviews. Our network of apartment listing websites draws on our multifamily database and includes researched and verified information. We proactively gather information on available rentals to improve the accuracy of the listings on our apartment ILS websites, including real time unit-level availability, current pricing and rent specials. We have continually invested in our network to improve the features and services offered to property managers and website users. Recent additions include: dynamic lead forms that provide more information about prospective residents, making rent trends information publicly available, free digital ad retargeting and integrated online rental solutions, including lease applications with tenant credit and background checks. We believe that we have created and maintain easily searchable apartment ILS websites with a comprehensive selection of rentals, information on actual rental availabilities and rents and in-depth data on neighborhoods, as well as easy to use and actionable tools for the rental process.\nWe believe that consumers expect accurate, actionable and comprehensive homes for sale information in a platform that allows collaboration between homebuyers and agents. Our residential websites include homebuyer-focused features like the ability to filter search results according to various criteria (e.g., home features, view and lot type), review rankings of nearby schools and tools to educate consumers on the home buying process. We plan to develop original, media rich content of neighborhoods, schools, parks and condominium buildings' amenities and common areas to supplement information in agent listings. We are designing tools to facilitate collaboration between homebuyers and agents.\nCoStar\u2019s Comprehensive Database\nWe have spent more than 30 years building and acquiring databases of commercial real estate information, which includes information on leasing, sales, comparable sales, tenants and demand statistics, as well as digital images. This highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields, tracking such categories as location, site and zoning information, building characteristics, space and unit availability, tax assessments, ownership, sales and lease comparables, space requirements, number of retail stores, number of listings, mortgage and deed information, for-sale and for-lease listings, income and expense histories, tenant names, lease expirations, contact information, historical trends, demographic information and retail sales per square foot. The database also includes building photographs, aerial photographs, 3-D virtual tours, plat maps and floor plans.\nCoStar Research\nResearch Department. Our research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department. Our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through phone calls, e-mails and additional research methods including field inspections, public records review, news monitoring and third-party data feeds. We have also set up direct feeds from larger apartment sites and have put in place an automated system that compiles information sourced from the internet in order to provide the most up-to-date information on rental availabilities.\nOur researchers are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our database information, training our clients to use CoStar Group products and handling their customer service questions, creating a \"one touch\" approach to customer care. Because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry, many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions through our online tool, which we refer to as our Marketing Center, or directly to our researchers.\nOur field research effort includes physical inspection of properties in order to research new availabilities, find additional property inventory, new construction, collect tenant information, verify existing information, photograph properties and create high quality videos of interior spaces (including walk-through videos and 3-D virtual tours), amenities and exterior features of properties. We utilize high-tech, field research vehicles primarily within North America and Europe. A significant majority of these vehicles are customized, energy efficient hybrid cars that are equipped with computers, Global Positioning System tracking software, high resolution digital cameras and handheld laser instruments to precisely measure buildings and geo-code\nand position them on digital maps. Each vehicle uses wireless technology to track and transmit field data. A typical site inspection of a commercial property consists of photographing the building, measuring the building, geo-coding the building, capturing \u201cfor-sale\u201d or \u201cfor-lease\u201d sign information, counting parking spaces, assessing property condition and construction and gathering tenant information. Field researchers also canvass properties, collecting tenant data suite-by-suite. We also utilize a low-flying airplane and a fleet of drones to conduct aerial research of commercial real estate. We place researchers on the low-flying aircraft to scout additional commercial developments and take aerial photographs and videos. Our U.S. drone operators are Federal Aviation Administration certified and trained to capture aerial photographs and videos.. Our drone operators in the U.K. and Canada are certified and trained to Civil Aviation Authority and Transport Canada standards with a permission for commercial operations pending.\nWe plan to leverage our capabilities developed from our extensive commercial real estate research efforts to produce original, media rich content of neighborhoods, schools, parks and condominium buildings' amenities and common areas for our residential products using professional photographers and fleets of drones to conduct aerial research of residential real estate.\nData and Image Providers. We license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third-party data sources. Licensing agreements with these entities allow us to use a variety of commercial real estate information, including property ownership, tenant information, demographic information, maps, aerial photographs and 3-D virtual apartment tours of apartment communities, all of which enhance various of our services. These license agreements generally grant us a non-exclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our information, analytics and online marketplaces.\nManagement and Quality Control Systems. Our research processes include automated and non-automated controls to ensure the integrity of the data collection process. A large number of automated data quality tests check for potential errors, including occupancy date conflicts, available square footage greater than building area, typical floor space greater than land area and expired leases. We also monitor changes to critical fields of information to ensure all information is kept in compliance with our standard definitions and methodology. Our non-automated quality control procedures include:\n\u2022Calling our information sources on recently updated properties to re-verify information;\n\u2022Performing periodic research audits and field checks to determine if we correctly canvassed buildings;\n\u2022Providing training and retraining to our research professionals to ensure accurate and standardized data compilation; and\n\u2022Compiling measurable performance metrics for research teams and managers for feedback on data quality.\nFinally, one of the most important and effective quality control measures we rely on is feedback provided by the commercial real estate professionals using our data every day.\nProprietary Technology\nOur information technology professionals focus on developing new services and features for our customers, improving and maintaining existing services, integrating our current services, securing our comprehensive database of commercial real estate information and delivering research automation tools that improve the quality of our data and increase the efficiency of our research analysts.\nOur information technology team is responsible for developing, improving and maintaining our information, analytics and online marketplace services. Our information technology team is also responsible for developing the infrastructure necessary to support our business processes, comprehensive database of commercial real estate information, analytics and online marketplaces and extensive image library. The team implements technologies and systems that introduce efficient workflows and controls designed to increase the production capacity of our research teams and improve the quality of our data. Over the years, the team has developed data collection and quality control mechanisms that we believe are unique within the commercial real estate industry. The team continues to develop and modify our enterprise information management system that integrates our sales, research, field research, customer support and accounting information. We use this system to maintain our commercial real estate research information, manage contacts with the commercial real estate community, provide research workflow automation and conduct daily automated quality assurance checks. In addition, our information technology team has also developed fraud-detection technology to detect and prevent unauthorized access to our services. To supplement the measures we take to prevent misuse of our information, we added state of the art adaptive authentication technology to the login process of our CoStar product.\nOur information technology professionals maintain the servers and network components necessary to support our services and research systems. Our core services are delivered from multiple data centers and cloud-based computing platforms to\nsupport uninterrupted service for our customers and are continually monitored to ensure fast and reliable customer access, to protect against unauthorized intrusions and to detect vulnerabilities.\nOur comprehensive data protection policy provides for use of secure networks, strong passwords and dual factor authentication systems, encrypted data fields, end to end encryption, endpoint detection and response systems and services, security information and event management systems, off-site storage, cloud services, end user and developer security training, multilayered anti-phishing malware and spam protections and other protective measures in an effort to ensure the availability and security of all core systems.\nServices\nOur portfolio of information, analytics and online marketplaces is branded and marketed to our customers and marketplace end users. Our services are primarily derived from a database of building-specific information and offer customers specialized tools for accessing, analyzing and using our information. Over time, we have enhanced and expanded, and we expect to continue to enhance and expand, our existing information, analytics and online marketplace services. We have developed and we expect to continue to develop additional services leveraging our database to meet the needs of our existing customers as well as potential new categories of customers.\nOur principal information, analytics and online marketplace services are described in the following paragraphs:\nCoStar\nCoStar is our subscription-based integrated platform for commercial real estate intelligence, which includes information about office, industrial, retail, multifamily, hospitality and student housing properties, properties for sale, comparable sales, tenants, space available for lease, industry professionals and their business relationships, industry news and market and lease analytical capabilities.

This tool can be used to produce an understandable cash flow analysis as well as key metrics about any proposed or existing lease. It combines financial modeling with CoStar\u2019s comprehensive property information, enabling the subscriber to compare lease alternatives, either from a landlord or tenant perspective.\n\u2022CoStar COMPS\u00ae is a robust database of comparable commercial real estate sales transactions and is designed for professionals who need to research property comparables, identify market trends, expedite the appraisal process and support property valuations. This feature offers subscribers numerous fields of property information, access to support documents (e.g., deeds of trust) for new comparables, demographics and the ability to view for-sale properties alongside sold properties plotted on a map, aerial image or in a table format.\n\u2022CoStar Tenant\u00ae is a detailed online business-to-business prospecting and analytics tool providing commercial real estate professionals with the most comprehensive commercial real estate-related tenant information available in our North American markets. CoStar Tenant profiles tenants occupying space in commercial buildings and provides updates on lease expirations - one of the service\u2019s key features - as well as occupancy levels, growth rates and numerous other facts. This allows users to target prospective clients quickly through a searchable database that identifies only those tenants meeting certain criteria.\n\u2022Market Analytics provides owners, investors, brokers, property managers, lenders, appraisers and other commercial real estate professionals the ability to view and report on aggregated market and submarket trends, including leasing,\nvacancy, rental rates, construction, investment sales activity and overall economic conditions that affect commercial real estate markets. Market Analytics covers all major real estate sectors including office, industrial, retail, multifamily, hospitality and student housing, and provides quantitatively driven and economist curated forecasts of supply, demand, vacancy and rent at the submarket level, and job growth and asset pricing at the market level.\n\u2022Public Record provides access to a searchable database of commercially-zoned parcels in the U.S. Users can search for property attributes, sale transaction, loan, lien and tax assessments information. Information in this module is sourced from numerous counties and jurisdictions that provide this data for ownership, title and property tax assessment purposes.\nInformation Services\nWe provide real estate and lease management technology solutions, including lease administration, lease accounting and abstraction services, through our CoStar Real Estate Manager\u00ae service offerings, as well as portfolio and debt analysis, management and reporting capabilities through our CoStar Investment Analysis and CoStar Risk Analytics\u00ae service offerings.

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no single client accounted for more than 5% of our revenues.\nSales and Marketing\nOur overall sales strategy is to provide optimal service to our existing customers, attract new clients and cross-sell the numerous solutions we offer. Our sales teams sell multiple products and are primarily located in field sales offices throughout the U.S., with others in Canada, the U.K., Spain, France and Germany. Our inside sales teams are largely based in Washington, DC and Richmond, Virginia. Our inside sales professionals actively work lead lists, prospect for new customers and perform in-person and virtual product demonstrations to convey the multiple solutions we offer.\nOur local offices typically support field sales and field research operations within the markets in which they operate. This enables our clients to benefit from a local presence. Our field sales force has the primary front-line responsibility for customer service, ensuring client satisfaction and building long-term relationships. Our local offices act as hubs for training, sources of market insight, product feedback sessions and connecting industry participants.\nWe actively manage client accounts with frequent meetings, product trainings and updates on new enhancements to our solutions. In 2021, we successfully implemented a number of important sales initiatives, focused on selling our products to brokers, property owners and lenders in the U.S. This focus will continue in 2022.\nOur primary marketing methods include: in person and virtual service demonstrations; targeted paid digital marketing; retargeting and social media marketing; direct marketing such as email; communication via our corporate website, campaign-specific websites and news services; participation in virtual trade shows and industry events; Company-sponsored events; client referrals; content marketing including webinars, seminars and white papers and other product-specific company newsletters distributed via email to our clients and prospects.\nComprehensive digital marketing and direct marketing are effective means for us to find prospective clients. Our digital marketing efforts include Search Engine Optimization, targeted paid advertising with major search engines, social media and display advertising on commercial real estate industry news and business websites and mobile applications and our direct marketing efforts include television, radio, out-of-home ads, direct mail and email and, when applicable, make extensive use of our unique, proprietary database. Once we have identified a prospective client, our most effective sales method is a service demonstration. We use various forms of integrated marketing and advertising to build brand awareness, brand identity and reinforce the value and benefits of our services.\nWe also sponsor and attend local in person and virtual association activities and events, including events for commercial real estate brokers, residential real estate agents, property owners, investors and retail and financial services institutions and attend or exhibit at virtual industry trade shows and conferences to reinforce our relationships with our core user groups.\nTo generate brand awareness and site traffic for the Apartments.com network of rental websites, we utilize a multi-channel marketing campaign featuring television and radio ads, online and digital advertising impressions, streaming audio and podcasts, social media, email, public relations and news articles, out-of-home and paid search marketing, all of which are reinforced with substantial Search Engine Optimization efforts. We plan to continue to utilize these marketing methods to generate brand awareness and site traffic for the Apartments.com network and have implemented similar marketing strategies for LoopNet and Ten-X. To generate brand awareness and site traffic for our residential products, we utilize digital advertising impressions, social media and paid search marketing, all of which are reinforced with Search Engine Optimization efforts. We will continue to work to determine the optimal level of marketing investment for each of these services for future periods.\nOur CoStar U.K. sales force continues to grow our existing client base and train users on the product enhancements we release. In Canada, our sales representatives focus on targeting brokers, owners and lender prospects for subscribing to our suite of products.\nTo encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based information services rather than fees based on actual system usage. Contract rates for subscription-based services are generally based on the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client\u2019s business focus, geography and the range of services subscribed for. Our marketing solutions are priced by exposure levels, the number of properties/spaces for-lease, rent or sale and the market in which they are offered. Listings for customers who purchase packages with the highest level of exposure usually appear first in search results and offer the richest media content and engagement opportunities for tenants searching for space, renters looking for an apartment or investors seeking an opportunity. Our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis.\nCompetition\nThe market for information, analytics and online marketplaces generally is competitive and extremely dynamic. In the commercial real estate, apartment rentals and home for sale industries, we believe the principal competitive factors affecting these services and providers are:\n\u2022Quality and depth of the underlying databases;\n\u2022Quality and quantity of leads and, for multifamily, leases delivered;\n\u2022Ease of use, flexibility and functionality of the software;\n\u2022Intuitiveness and appeal of the user interface;\n\u2022Timeliness of the data, including listings;\n\u2022Breadth of geographic coverage and services offered;\n\u2022Completeness and accuracy of content;\n\u2022Client service and support;\n\u2022Perception that the service offered is the industry standard;\n\u2022Price;\n\u2022Effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts;\n\u2022Proprietary nature of methodologies, databases and technical resources;\n\u2022Vendor reputation;\n\u2022Brand loyalty among customers; and\n\u2022Capital resources.\nWe compete directly and indirectly for customers with the following categories of companies:\n\u2022Online marketing services, internet listing services, mobile software applications or data exchanges targeted to commercial real estate brokers, buyers and sellers of commercial real estate properties, insurance companies, mortgage brokers and lenders, such as Reed Business Information Limited and its Estates Gazette and Radius Data Exchange products, SquareFoot, officespace.com, Brevitas, Catylist & Commercial Exchange (part of Moody's), Altus Group & Commercial Property Search (part of Reonomy), Digsy, Quantum Listing, RealNex MarketPlace, Rofo, CIMLS, CompStak, Rightmove, Yardi (CommercialEdge), CREXi, TotalCommercial.com, DebtX, Real Capital Markets, VTS, TenantBase and Spacelist;\n\u2022Publishers and distributors of information, analytics and marketing services, including regional providers and national print publications, such as CBRE Economic Advisors, Marshall & Swift, REIS Network (part of Moody's), Real Capital Analytics, Real Capital Markets, Reonomy, Yardi Matrix, RealPage and its Axiometrics business, Altus Insight and Altus RealNet (Canada);\n\u2022Search engines, internet listing services and mobile software applications featuring apartments for rent, such as Google, Bing, Facebook Marketplace, ApartmentGuide.com, Rent.com, Rentals.com, Zillow Rentals, Trulia Rentals, StreetEasy, HotPads.com, MyNewPlace.com, Zumper, Craigslist, ApartmentList.com, Move.com, Realtor.com, RentCafe.com, RentHop, RentBerry, ApartmentRatings, Nooklyn, Home Finder and Rentable;\n\u2022Search engines, internet listing services and mobile software applications featuring homes for sale, such as Google, Bing, Facebook Marketplace, Zillow, Trulia, Redfin, Realtor.com, Move.com, Craigslist, RealtyTrac, MLS.com, Home Finder, For Sale by Owner and Auction.com, as well as agent marketing platforms and workflow providers;\n\u2022Hospitality benchmarking and analytics services, such as Lodging Econometrics, Kalibri Labs, Amadeus, HotStats and Shigi Group (SnapShot);\n\u2022Online and mobile software application providers in the residential real estate industry, including Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com and Rocket Mortgage, as well as agent marketing platforms and workflow providers;\n\u2022In the commercial real estate market, locally controlled real estate boards, exchanges or associations sponsoring commercial property listing services and the companies with whom they partner, such as Catylist, the National Association of Realtors, CCIM Institute, Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, the Commercial Association of Realtors Data Services and AIR CRE;\n\u2022Real estate portfolio management software solutions, such as Cougar Software, MRI Software, Altus, RealPage, AppFolio and SiteCompli;\n\u2022Real estate lease management and administration software solutions, such as Accruent, Tririga, Manhattan Software, Tango Analytics, Lease Accelerator, Visual Lease, Sequnetra, Lease Harbor and AMT Direct;\n\u2022Commercial real estate auction platforms such as CREXi, Marketplace, by RealINSIGHT and RCM Lightbox.\n\u2022In-house research departments operated by commercial real estate brokers; and\n\u2022Public record providers.\nAs markets for information, analytics and online marketplaces develop, additional competitors (including companies which could have greater access to data, financial, product development, technical, analytic or marketing resources than we do) may enter a market and competition may intensify. For example, a company like Google, which has a far-reaching web presence and substantial data aggregation capabilities, could enter the commercial real estate marketing arena. A company like Zillow, which already has a presence in residential real estate and the apartment rentals industry, could use its resources to further expand in the online apartment rentals industry creating greater competition among internet listing services for the marketing budgets of property managers and property owners. While we believe that we have successfully differentiated ourselves from existing competitors, current or future competitors could materially harm our business. We may also enter markets where incumbent players have greater name recognition and resources, creating challenges as we work to expand.\nProprietary Rights\nTo protect our proprietary rights in our methodologies, database, software, trademarks and other intellectual property, we depend upon a combination of:\n\u2022Trade secret, misappropriation, unfair competition, copyright, trademark, computer fraud, database protection and other laws;\n\u2022Registration of copyrights and trademarks;\n\u2022Nondisclosure, noncompetition and other contractual provisions with employees and consultants;\n\u2022License agreements with customers;\n\u2022Patent protection; and\n\u2022Technical measures.\nWe seek to protect our software\u2019s source code, our database and our photography as trade secrets and under copyright law. Although copyright registration is not a prerequisite for copyright protection, we have filed for copyright registration for many of our databases, photographs, software and other materials. Under current U.S. copyright law, the arrangement and selection of data may be protected, but the actual data itself may not be. Certain U.K. database protection laws provide additional protections for our U.K. databases. We license our services under license agreements that grant our clients non-exclusive, non-transferable rights. These agreements restrict the disclosure and use of our information and prohibit the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of any of our proprietary information, methodologies or analytics.\nWe also attempt to protect our proprietary databases, our trade secrets and our proprietary information through confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with our employees and consultants. Our services also include technical measures designed to detect, discourage and prevent unauthorized access to and/or copying of our intellectual property. We have established an internal antipiracy team that uses fraud-detection technology to continually monitor use of our services to detect and prevent unauthorized access, and we actively prosecute individuals and firms that engage in this unlawful activity.\nWe maintain U.S. and international trademark registrations for CoStar Group\u2019s core service names and proactively file U.S. and international trademark applications covering our new and planned service names. We have federally registered trademarks covering our brands and services including CoStar\u00ae, CoStar Property\u00ae, CoStar COMPS\u00ae, CoStar Lease Analysis\u00ae, LoopNet\u00ae, Showcase.com\u00ae, CityFeet.com\u00ae, Apartments.com, Lands of America, Ten-X\u00ae, Homesnap\u00ae and Homes.com\u00ae, among many others. In the U.S., trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and have not been found to be generic. We consider our trademarks in the aggregate to constitute a valuable asset.\nIn addition, we maintain a patent portfolio that protects certain of our systems and methodologies. We currently have four patents in Canada, which expire in 2035 (1 patent) and 2036 (3 patents), covering, among other things, certain features of our field research methodologies and user interface features, and thirteen patents in the U.S. which expire in 2022 (2 patents), 2025 (1 patent), 2032 (2 patents), 2036 (3 patents), 2037 (4 patents) and 2038 (1 patent), covering, among other things, certain features of our field research methodologies and user interface feature. We regard the rights protected by our patents as valuable to our business, but do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single patent or portfolio of patents as a whole.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2022, we employed 4,742 employees. U.S-based employees represent approximately 89% of the overall employee population, followed by 9% in European, Asia-Pacific and Latin American countries and 2% in Canadian provinces. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages. As is common with many German companies, employees in our German subsidiary, Thomas Daily GmbH, have elected five fellow employees to form a Works Council, which represents our employees at the location. The Works Council has certain co-determination rights and rights to receive information from us and engage us in discussions under applicable law. BureauxLocaux, in France, has a Social and Economic Committee, which is an employee representative body.\nOur human resources and recruiting team works in partnership with business leaders, using a robust to attract a diverse slate of candidates to fill vacancies and contribute to our growth, including our Careers page on our corporate website, employee referral program, social media and digital platforms, direct outreach, partnerships with commercial real estate industry groups and universities and specific partnerships and programs. The development and retention of our employees is critical to our success. To support career development, we offer on-demand and in-person training programs to new hires, managers and leaders. We also offer a mentoring program, which pairs employees seeking mentorship with more experienced colleagues.\nTo assess employee engagement, we partner with a survey vendor to survey employees annually. Insights and results gathered from the survey are shared with our leadership, managers and employees and help to inform our human resources program strategy each year. We believe that diverse teams deliver better and more innovative solutions. The diversity of thought that comes from different perspectives and backgrounds allows us to deliver cutting edge research and technology solutions that best serve our customers. We have a dedicated Diversity, Equity and Inclusion team that is tasked with developing topical programming, communications and training including, but not limited to, celebrations of various heritage months and oversight of our employee resource groups, which create avenues for mentoring and professional development within these groups as well as education and awareness across the organization.\nWe provide competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain high quality talent. In addition to base salaries, compensation may include annual bonuses, commissions and equity awards. Employees may also participate in an Employee Stock Purchase Plan and a 401(k) Plan with a company match. Our comprehensive set of health and wellness benefits are affordable, high\nquality and valuable to employees and their families. Employees have multiple choices for health plans, access to vision and dental benefits and may participate in our employee wellness program as well as our employee assistance program. Additional benefits include paid time off, parental bonding leave, college savings benefits, tuition reimbursement, company-subsidized commuter benefits and access to mental health, tax and legal services.\nWe consider the health and wellbeing of our employees, clients and communities to be our top priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. We adopted new policies and procedures to ensure safety, which currently include requirements for mask wearing in the office and when coming into contact with the community. We provide personal protective equipment for all employees, including face coverings, hand sanitizer, antibacterial surface sanitizer and other protective equipment as needed. In addition, our office space workstations have been redesigned and upgraded to allow for six feet of social distancing between them and include physical barrier shielding. HVAC systems in our offices have been upgraded with enhanced filtration, increased fresh air intake and ultraviolet lighting disinfection. We have also made a significant investment in commercial grade air filtration equipment and monitor air quality in majority of our office locations. Finally, all high contact surfaces in our offices are cleaned multiple times during the day and deep cleaned each night. We hosted four on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics for our employees and their family members during 2021, and we established an HR Concierge service to coordinate COVID-19 vaccinations for employees outside of our major office locations. We also provide free COVID-19 PCR and antibody testing for our employees and their immediate household family members.\nAvailable Information\nOur investor relations internet website is http://www.costargroup.com/investors. The reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report, quarterly reports and current reports, as well as amendments to those reports, are available free of charge on our internet website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the Commission at http://www.sec.gov.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks related to our business\nOur revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients. Our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information, analytics and online marketplace services. Our subscription-based services generate the largest portion of our revenues. Our revenue may not grow, or could decrease, if we cannot attract new customers, continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers. We may not be able to continue to grow our customer base, keep the cancellation rate low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors, including, without limitation: economic pressures; the business failure of current clients; customer decisions that they do not need our services or to use alternative services; customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 budgetary constraints; consolidation in the real estate and/or financial services industries; data quality; technical problems; competitive pressures; or devaluation of the local currencies of international customers relative to the U.S. dollar which impairs the purchasing power of such customers. We compete against many other real estate information, analytics and marketing service providers for business. If clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients, then our renewal rate, net new sales and revenues may decline or fail to meet expectations.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop and introduce new or upgraded information, analytics and online marketplace services that are attractive to our users and advertisers or successfully combine or shift focus from current services with less demand, which could decrease our revenues and our profitability. Our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of customers and potential customers and to successfully introduce new and upgraded services, including services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to advertisers. To be successful, we must be able to quickly adapt to changes in the industry, as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information, analytics and online marketplace services. As a result, we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies.\nDeveloping new services and upgrades to services, as well as integrating and coordinating current services, imposes heavy burdens on our systems department, product development team, management and researchers. The processes are costly and our efforts to develop, integrate and enhance our services may not be successful. In addition, launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts additional strain on our sales and marketing resources. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share or in obtaining widespread adoption of new or upgraded services, we may not be able to offset the expenses associated with the development, launch and marketing of the new or upgraded service, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. For example, to generate brand awareness and site traffic for our marketplaces, we have and will continue to invest significant resources in multi-channel marketing campaigns. If these marketing campaigns do not increase brand awareness, site traffic and/or revenues, the cost of these campaigns could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, as we integrate acquired businesses, we continue to assess which services we believe will best meet the needs of our customers. If we eliminate or phase out a service and are not able to offer and successfully market and sell an alternative service, our revenue may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We compete to attract advertisers. Our competitors may have greater brand recognition or more direct sales personnel than we have and may generate more web traffic than we do, which may provide them with competitive advantages. To compete successfully for advertisers, we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services. Pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers\u2019 overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins, lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses. If we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA downturn or consolidation in the real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services. The real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors, including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand; reduced real estate demand due to increased remote work policies; rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise that negatively impact investment returns; excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished rent growth; and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate. A downturn in the real estate market, including as a result of a decline in leasing activity and absorption rates may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our\ncurrent or future customers, either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability. A depressed real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base, which could decrease demand for our information, analytics and online marketplaces. Also, companies in this industry may consolidate, often in order to reduce expenses. Consolidation, or other cost-cutting measures by our customers, may lead to cancellations of our information, analytics and online marketplace services by our customers, reduce the number of our existing clients, reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients\u2019 bargaining power, all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability. If cancellations, reductions of services and failures to pay increase, and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenues by increasing sales to new or existing customers, our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates.\nIf we are unable to hire qualified persons for, or retain and continue to develop, our sales force, or if our sales force is unproductive, our revenues could be adversely affected. In order to support revenues and revenue growth, we need to continue to develop, train and retain our sales force. Our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors, including: our ability to attract, integrate and motivate sales personnel; our ability to effectively train our sales force; the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services; our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group; the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive; the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel; our ability to effectively structure our sales force; and our ability to effectively manage a multi-location sales organization, including field sales personnel. If we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain our sales force, including sales force management, or if our sales force is unproductive, our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase. We may face additional challenges in hiring employees in an increasingly competitive job market.\nOur internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins. To increase our revenue growth, we continue to invest in our business, including internal investments in product and content development to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers and external investments in sales and marketing to generate brand awareness. Our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of these investments. Furthermore, our investments may not produce the expected results. If we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy, we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins.\nWe may be unable to increase awareness of our brands, including CoStar, LoopNet, Apartments.com, BizBuySell, LandsofAmerica, STR, Ten-X, Homes.com and Homesnap, which could adversely affect our business. We rely heavily on our brands, which we believe are key assets of our company. Awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of, and subscribers to, our online marketplaces, such as LoopNet, the Apartments.com network of rental websites, our Homes.com and Homesnap residential marketplaces, CoStar Showcase and the Land.com network of rural lands for-sale. We expect to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing in 2022 as we seek to grow the numbers of users of, subscribers to and advertisers on, our marketplaces. Our methods of advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or, ultimately, be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands, or if we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services and increased advertising on our websites, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf internet search engines do not prominently feature our websites on the search engine results page, traffic to our websites would decrease and, if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our ability to generate revenues from our marketplace business depends, in part, on our ability to attract users to our websites. Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and other internet search engines drive traffic to our websites, including CoStar.com, the Apartments.com network of rental websites, the LoopNet.com network of commercial real estate websites, Ten-X.com, our Homes.com and Homesnap residential marketplaces, the BizBuySell.com network of business for-sale websites and the Land.com network of land for-sale websites. For example, when a user enters in a search query for an apartment building name or address into an internet search engine, the internet search engine\u2019s ranking of our Apartments.com webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed on the search engine results page. Our ability to maintain prominent search result rankings and positioning is not entirely within our control. Our competitors\u2019 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SEM) efforts may result in webpages from their websites receiving higher rankings than the webpages from our websites. Internet search engines could revise their algorithms and methodologies in ways that would adversely affect our search result rankings. Internet search engine providers could form partnerships or enter into other business relationships with our competitors resulting in competitors\u2019 sites receiving higher search result rankings. Internet search engines are increasingly placing alternative search features (such as featured snippets, local map results and other immersive experiences) on the search engine results page above or more prominently than search engine results. If our search result rankings are not prominently displayed, traffic to our websites may decline which could slow the growth of our user base. Our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past and we anticipate similar fluctuations will occur in the future. If we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines or otherwise fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces, our ability to acquire additional subscribers or\nadvertisers and deliver leads to and retain existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our marketing expenses may increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites. Increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenues through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products.\nCompetition could render our services uncompetitive and reduce our profitability. The markets for information systems and services and for online marketplaces in general are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Competition in these markets may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources. Our existing or future competitors, may have greater name recognition, larger customer bases, better technology or data, lower prices, easier access to data, greater user traffic or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we have to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings. Competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to ours that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources. Our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns, obtain more data, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, subscribers, advertisers, distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements. Increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses, which would reduce our profitability.\nIf real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers, our operating results would be harmed. Our marketplace businesses, including LoopNet, the Apartments.com network of rental websites, our residential brands including Homes.com and Homesnap and the Land.com network of rural lands for-sale, depend on advertising revenues generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry, including property managers and owners and other advertisers. Our ability to attract and retain advertisers, and ultimately to generate advertising revenue, depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022Increasing the number of unique visitors to, and users of, our websites and mobile applications;\n\u2022The quantity and quality of the leads that we provide to our advertisers;\n\u2022The success of any marketing and product development efforts directed at attracting additional users and advertisers to our marketplaces;\n\u2022Keeping pace with changes in technology and with our competitors; and\n\u2022Offering an attractive return on investment to our advertisers for their advertising dollars spent with us.\nFurther, with respect to the Apartments.com network of rental websites, our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates. If vacancy rates are too high or too low, advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services.\nMany of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces do not have long-term contracts. These advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice. As existing subscriptions for advertising expire, we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions. We may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers\u2019 spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives. In addition, future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us. If current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers, our advertising revenues and business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to successfully identify, finance, integrate and/or manage costs related to acquisitions, our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected. We have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses, services, databases and technologies, and expect to continue to do so in the future. Our acquisition strategy depends on our ability to identify, and the availability of, suitable acquisition candidates. We are likely to incur costs in connection with proposed acquisitions, but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate any particular proposed transaction for various reasons. For example, in 2021, the FTC withheld approval for our proposed acquisition of RentPath, the purchase agreement was subsequently terminated and we incurred a termination fee of $52 million. We are also likely to incur severance costs and other integration costs post-acquisition. Costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation or prospects of the combined business. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including risks that we will not be able to realize or capitalize on synergies created through combinations; manage the integration of personnel and products or services; manage the integration of acquired infrastructure and controls; control potential increases in operating costs; manage geographically remote operations; maintain management\u2019s attention on other business concerns and avoid potential disruptions in ongoing operations during an acquisition process or integration efforts; successfully enter markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience, including foreign markets whose practices, regulations or laws may pose increased risk; and retain key employees, clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies. We may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including expected synergies. For example, we may be unable to fully integrate Homesnap, Homes.com and BureauxLocaux with CoStar when and as expected.\nWe are subject to an FTC consent order, which is publicly available on the FTC's website at http://www.ftc.gov/, that, among other things, requires us to give the FTC advance notice of certain acquisitions. Compliance with this order could prevent us from closing certain acquisitions or add significant time and cost to such acquisitions, ultimately making an acquisition prohibitive or preventing us from realizing its anticipated benefits.\nExternal factors, such as compliance with laws and regulations and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful integration of an acquired business. An acquired business could strain our system of internal controls and diminish its effectiveness. Acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets. We may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, if necessary to finance future acquisitions, making it impossible or more costly to complete future acquisitions. If we are able to obtain financing, the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations. Further, certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, which can be time consuming and costly to obtain or may be denied, as in the case of RentPath. If regulatory approval is obtained, the terms of any such approval may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business. If regulatory approval is denied, we may incur significant, additional costs payable to an acquisition target as a result of failure to close the transaction. For example, we incurred a termination fee of $52 million in connection with termination of the RentPath purchase agreement. Significant break-up fees incurred in the future may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we had approximately $2.8 billion of goodwill and intangibles as of December 31, 2021. Future acquisitions may increase this amount. If we are required to recognize goodwill and intangibles impairment charges in the future, this would negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges, which may reduce our profitability.\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy laws and standards could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients and vendors. We collect, use and disclose personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. We collect, store and use biometric data and sensitive or confidential transaction and account information. We also collect personal information from tenants and landlords, including social security numbers, birthdates and financial information to facilitate the apartment rental application and payment process between a renter and property manager. As a result, we are subject to a variety of state, national and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") and California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"). These laws and regulations are evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. For example, the GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the EU and imposes substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process. The CCPA expands the rights of California residents to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Other states have adopted, or are considering enacting, similar laws. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with privacy or data protection laws could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and\ncould materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Compliance with any of the foregoing laws and regulations can be costly, can delay or impede the development of new products, and may require us to change the way we operate.\nThe interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are uncertain. These laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products. If so, in addition to the possibility of negative publicity, fines, lawsuits and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products, which could harm our business.\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business and financial condition. As stated above, our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers\u2019 personal data. We also collect, store and process employee personal data. An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies and financial institutions, as well as government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications and infrastructure.\nThe techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to a target's systems, data or customers' data, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. We expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to or disrupt our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce (for example, through spear phishing attacks or social engineering) our employees, customers, vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names, passwords, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, could compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data in our systems. Our efforts to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, may not be effective. Further, the security measures and procedures our customers, vendors and other users of our systems have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyberattacks or system failures.\nOur information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal or proprietary information that is stored on or accessible through those systems. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities. Actual or perceived breaches of our security could result in any of the following, among other things, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations:\n\u2022Interrupt our operations;\n\u2022Result in our systems or services being unavailable;\n\u2022Result in improper disclosures of data;\n\u2022Result in improper payments;\n\u2022Materially harm our reputation and brands;\n\u2022Result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure;\n\u2022Cause us to incur significant remediation costs;\n\u2022Lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services;\n\u2022Divert the attention of management from the operation of our business; and\n\u2022Result in significant contractual penalties or other payments as a result of third-party losses or claims.\nIn addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects on our business. For example, in December 2020, we became aware that one of our vendors providing IT infrastructure management software, SolarWinds Corporation, had been compromised by cyberattacks. As of December 22, 2020, we had implemented the fully patched versions of the SolarWinds software and we took additional measures to block internet connectivity to and from all SolarWinds' Orion servers. Although we have not identified any compromise of our IT systems due to the use of SolarWinds software to date, we continue to monitor our network for any potential impact related to the SolarWinds cyberattack. Similarly, we are regularly exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software that we use in the ordinary course of business, such as the recently identified Log4J vulnerability. While this vulnerability did not have a material adverse effect on our operations, it and similar incidents require us to devote time and resources to remediation on a regular basis. Notwithstanding our efforts, there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities in widely deployed software will not materially harm our business. Any breach of our security measures or the loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of\nthe SolarWinds cyberattack, could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. The coverage under our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nTechnical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers\u2019 ability to access our services, or the software, internal applications, database and network systems underlying our services, could damage our reputation and lead to reduced demand for our information, analytics and online marketplace services, lower revenues and increased costs. Our business, brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our websites, the internet and our service providers. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, software errors, physical or electronic break-ins, or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems (such as denial of service attacks or use of malware), could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit users' access to our services. Our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases, computers and software, telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire, flood, power loss, security breaches, computer viruses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes and similar events.\nIn addition, the software, internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be error-free. We may encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software, internal applications and systems. Our users rely on our services for the conduct of their own businesses. Disruptions in, technical problems with, or reductions in ability to access, our services for any reason could damage our users\u2019 businesses, harm our reputation, result in additional costs or reduce demand for our information, analytics and online marketplace services, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe majority of the communications, network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in Virginia and California. We do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, security breaches, computer viruses, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, earthquakes and similar events. These risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nA failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users, and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible. Problems faced or caused by our information technology service providers, including content distribution service providers, private network providers, internet providers and third-party web-hosting providers, or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers (as applicable), could adversely affect the experience of our users. Any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy reorganization, faced by these third-party service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our third-party service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, our business could be harmed. In addition, if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions, such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications, which could harm our business.\nOur business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to the future growth of our business, which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are planning to undertake a large infrastructure project to build out our campus in Richmond, Virginia, the costs of which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. In December 2021, we announced our plans to expand our research and technology center in Richmond, Virginia. These plans will require significant capital expenditures over the next several years and our business plans may change. Future changes in growth or fluctuations in cash flow may also negatively impact our ability to finance this project. Additionally, actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our projected capital expenditures, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are provided with any grants, tax credits, abatements or other incentives related to this expansion effort and do not meet requirements associated with those incentives, we may not be able to benefit from those incentives, which could cause the cost of the project to be significantly more than anticipated or significantly increase our taxes above what we currently expect. We are currently considering financing options and may finance construction with cash on hand. Use of cash on hand to finance construction would reduce the amount of cash available for other corporate uses and could also reduce our ability to meet our\nscheduled debt service obligations or to meet the covenants required to borrow additional funds under our 2020 Credit Agreement. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial position. Expanding into new markets and increasing the depth of our coverage in existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research, systems development, sales, marketing and general managerial resources. If we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively, if our expansion efforts take longer or are more expensive than planned or we are not successful in marketing and selling our services in existing or new markets, our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues.\nOur operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to market cyclicality, each of which could negatively affect our stock price. The real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions, economic cycles, seasonality and many other factors, which in turn may impact our financial results. The different sectors of the large and fragmented industry, such as office, industrial, retail, multifamily, single family and others, are influenced differently by different factors, and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing. As such, it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions or seasonality from year-to-year on our overall operating results. We generally see higher sales of Apartments.com listing services during the peak summer rental season and higher CoStar sales towards the end of the year, however sales fluctuate from year-to-year and may fluctuate more widely when there are changes in general economic conditions or the industry, such as changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we generally incur greater marketing expenses during the second quarter, which coincides with the peak season for apartment rentals. The timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods, particularly slowdowns during the end-of-year holiday period, and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods, could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period. If we are unable to adequately respond to economic, seasonal or cyclical conditions, our revenues, expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our operating results, revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons, including those described in this paragraph and below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u2022Rates of subscriber adoption and retention;\n\u2022Timing of our sales conference or significant marketing events;\n\u2022Changes in our pricing strategy and timing of changes;\n\u2022The timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements;\n\u2022The shift of focus from, or phase out of services that overlap or are redundant with other services we offer;\n\u2022The amount and timing of our expenses and capital expenditures;\n\u2022The amount and timing of non-cash stock-based charges;\n\u2022Acquisition-related costs or impairment charges associated with such investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022Competition;\n\u2022Changes or consolidation in the real estate industry;\n\u2022Interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022Execution of our expansion and integration plans;\n\u2022The development of our sales force;\n\u2022Foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022Inflation; and\n\u2022Changes in client budgets.\nThese fluctuations could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question and/or future periods or cause our stock price to decline. In addition, changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income. Fluctuations in our financial results, revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel. Our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Florance, and our other officers and key employees. Our business requires highly skilled technical, sales, management, web product and development, marketing and research personnel, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. To retain and attract key personnel, we use various measures, including employment agreements, awards under a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees. These measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of Mr. Florance or other key officers or employees. We experienced an increase in turnover as we returned nearly all our workforce to the office. We may face additional challenges in retaining employees in an increasingly competitive job market.\nChanges in tax laws, regulations or fiscal and tax policies or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business. In addition, from time to time, U.S. and foreign tax authorities, including state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rate. For example, the U.S. Congress has advanced a variety of tax legislation proposals, and while the final form of any legislation is uncertain, the current proposals, if enacted, could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.\nOur business and results of operations have been and may be, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse and continue for an unknown period of time. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption around the world. The extent to which COVID-19 will further impact our business, operations and financial results, including the duration and magnitude of such impact, is uncertain and will depend on numerous rapidly evolving factors that we cannot accurately predict including, among others:\n\u2022The length and severity of the pandemic, including new variants;\n\u2022The negative impact on global and regional economies, credit markets and economic activity;\n\u2022Governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity;\n\u2022The impact of business disruptions and reductions in employment levels and the level of consumer confidence in the economy on our clients and the resulting impact on their demand for our services and solutions;\n\u2022Business consolidations or failures among businesses that we serve;\n\u2022Our clients\u2019 ability to pay for our services and solutions and our ability to collect payment for services provided; and\n\u2022The pace and extent of economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, including recovery in the real estate industry in particular.\nThe demand for office space could decrease significantly as businesses implement hybrid or all work from home arrangements in response to employee desire for more flexibility, which may lead to a downturn in the commercial real estate market. A depressed commercial real estate market would have a negative impact on our core customer base, which could impact our customers\u2019 ability to subscribe and pay for our services and reduce demand for our services. Reduced demand and increased cancellations could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rates to decline and reduce our profitability. As a result of COVID-19 and its impact on global economic conditions, including the real estate industry, towards the end of the first quarter and in the first two months of the second quarter of 2020, we saw an increase in customer requests for cancellations or suspensions, a reduction in new customer sales, failures to pay and delays in payments of amounts owed to us. We may see additional requests as current economic conditions cause customers to reduce expenses and prolong the decision-making time before purchasing third party services, which may lead to fewer of our services being purchased or service cancellations. The extent and duration of any future continued weakening of the economy is unknown, and there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the economy will be successful or available to us and our customers and, if successful, when the benefits will be seen.\nCOVID-19, and the disruption in global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors discussed in this Report, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks. For additional discussion of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be materially adverse to our operations and financial results, please see \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\" in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards and facilitation of other customer payments.\nWe depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions. If we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems to authorize and process credit card transactions, one or more of the major credit card companies could disallow our continued use of their payment products. If we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels, our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us. We could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies. In addition, if the systems to authorize and process credit card transactions fail to work properly and, as a result, we do not charge our customers\u2019 credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions and Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments, both for payments made to us directly for our services and for payments made by renters to landlords using our online leasing services. If we or any one or more of these service providers fail to maintain adequate systems for authorization\nand processing credit card payments, it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. Further, if we or any one or more of these service providers fail to maintain adequate systems for authorization and processing of credit, debit, ACH or similar payments or if any such service provider were to terminate or modify its relationship with us unexpectedly, our ability to process those customer transactions would be adversely affected, which could decrease sales, discourage customers away from our marketplace services, result in potential legal liability, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and, as a result, we do not charge our customers\u2019 credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply. We are required to comply with payment card industry security standards. Failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors. Any failure to comply also may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. Further, there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss, or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, cardholders and transactions.\nThe payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data are compromised due to a breach of data, we may be liable for significant costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent payment transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and higher costs, each of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels, our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us. Any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\nRisks related to our data, intellectual property and listings\nIf we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate, comprehensive or reliable data, we could experience reduced demand for our information, analytics and online marketplace services. Our success depends on our clients\u2019 confidence in the comprehensiveness, accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide. Establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging. If our data, including the data we obtain from third parties or directly from brokers through the Marketing Center feature on CoStar and LoopNet, or analysis is not current, accurate, comprehensive or reliable, we could experience reduced demand for our services or be subject to legal claims by our customers, either of which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses.\nIf we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property, our business, brands, competitive position and operating results could be harmed. The success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property, including intellectual property involved in our methodologies, databases, services and software. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, patent, copyright and other laws, nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions, license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. However, current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet-related businesses are uncertain and evolving, and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights. We find our proprietary content on competitors' sites. If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property, including our content, our brands and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. The same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved, either as a plaintiff or as a defendant, have cost us and could continue to cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management\u2019s attention from operating our business. In addition, if we do not prevail on an intellectual property claim, this could result in a change to our methodology or information, analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability.\nEffective trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which we provide our services. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U. S. and,\ntherefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could harm our competitive position. This risk will increase as we continue to expand our business into new international jurisdictions.\nWe may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data, as well as data from other companies, or copycat websites that may misappropriate our data. Third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping, robots or other means and aggregate and display this data on their websites. In addition, \u201ccopycat\u201d websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our website. We may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures available to us may be insufficient to stop their operations and the misappropriation of our data. Any measures that we may take to enforce our rights could require us to expend significant financial or other resources.\nWe may be subject to legal liability for collecting, displaying or distributing information. Because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others, we may be subject to claims for breach of contract, defamation, negligence, unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories, such as breach of laws related to privacy and data protection. We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims and we could be subject to public notice requirements that may affect our reputation. Our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information, analytics and online marketplaces to users.\nIf we are unable to obtain or retain listings from real estate brokers, agents, property owners and apartment property managers, our marketplace services, could be less attractive to current or potential customers, which could reduce our revenues. The value of our real estate marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted. As the number of listings increases, so does the utility of a marketplace's search, listing and marketing services. We depend substantially on brokers, agents, property owners and, in the case of apartment rentals, property managers to submit listings to our marketplaces. If these parties choose not to continue their listings with us, or choose to list them with a competitor, our marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants, resulting in reduced revenue.\nRisks related to our international operations\nInternational operations expose us to additional business risks, which may reduce our profitability. Our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks, including: currency exchange rate fluctuations; adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries; including differing laws regarding privacy and data protection; difficulties in managing foreign operations; limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods; costs of enforcing contractual obligations; impact of recessions in economies outside the U.S.; and potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel, systems development, research and sales departments and general managerial resources. If we are not able to manage our international operations successfully, we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced. Finally, the investment required for additional international expansion sometimes exceeds the profit generated from such expansion, which reduces our profitability and may adversely affect our financial position.\nFluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial position. A portion of our business is denominated in foreign currencies. We translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our financial statements. During periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate. Significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue, which in turn affects our consolidated revenue. Currently, we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. We may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future, but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully, on acceptable terms or at all. We cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future. Further, significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets, as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position.\nThe economic effects of \u201cBrexit\u201d may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which British citizens approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d On January 31, 2020, the U.K. officially withdrew from the E.U., beginning a transition period of negotiations between the British government and the E.U. and other governments. On December 24, 2020, the E.U. and the U.K. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues. The impact of Brexit, the December 2020 post-Brexit agreement and the future relationship between the E.U. and the U.K., including terms not addressed in the December 2020 agreement, remain uncertain. Such uncertainty could cause political and economic uncertainty in the U.K. and the rest of Europe, which could harm our business and financial results. In particular, Brexit caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in global equity markets, currency exchange rates and other asset prices, including those related to real property. Brexit may also lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate, and compliance with those laws and regulations may be cumbersome, difficult or costly. Further, Brexit may lead other E.U. member countries to consider referendums regarding their E.U. membership. We cannot yet predict the future implications of Brexit, including whether it could increase our cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. The impact to us from Brexit may affect not only our U.K. operations but operations in other parts of the E.U.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could decrease our flexibility and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1 billion of Senior Notes outstanding and an additional approximately $750 million available to be drawn under the 2020 Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that our future cash flows will be sufficient to make payments of interest or principal on the Senior Notes or any amounts due and payable under the 2020 Credit Agreement. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Furthermore, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, and if we incur additional indebtedness or other liabilities, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nThe 2020 Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our long-term best interests. These covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our domestic subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) incur liens, (iii) pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, investments or acquisitions, (iv) merge or consolidate with another person, and (v) sell, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the 2020 Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a maintenance covenant that we will not exceed a total net leverage ratio, calculated as total consolidated debt, net of up to $1.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, to consolidated EBITDA, of 4.50 to 1.00. The operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2020 Credit Agreement may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions. Our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements. If we fail to comply with these covenants, we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants, seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures. We may be unable to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all, or on favorable terms.\nA breach of the covenants under the 2020 Credit Agreement or the indenture that governs the Senior Notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration provision applies. In the event the holders of the Senior Notes or our other debt accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nOur borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement will carry a variable interest rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The U.K. authority that regulates LIBOR announced that it will not compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after June 2023. The full impact of any transition away from LIBOR remains unclear. The 2020 Credit Agreement allows the Company and the administrative agent under the 2020 Credit Agreement to amend the 2020 Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR with one or more Secured Overnight Financing Rate based rates or another alternative benchmark rate. We may not be able to agree\nwith the administrative agent on a replacement reference rate that is as favorable as LIBOR, which may increase in the cost of our borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement.\nOur indebtedness increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, marketing and other general corporate activities; limits our ability to borrow additional funds; and may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs, reduce our access to capital or result in the loss of certain covenant suspensions. Our debt rating could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nIn addition, the 2020 Credit Agreement provides that, during any period of time in which we maintain a corporate investment grade rating from any two of Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services, Fitch Ratings, Inc. or Moody\u2019s Investors Services, Inc. (such period, a \u201cCovenant Suspension Period\u201d), certain customary negative and affirmative covenants contained in the 2020 Credit Agreement are suspended, including the covenants restricting affiliate transactions, incurrence of indebtedness, investments, asset sales and restricted payments. A lowering of one or both of our investment grade ratings would result in increased compliance costs and would impose certain operating restrictions, either of which could be materially adverse to our operations and financial results.",

There are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those stated above in under the heading \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and in Item 1A. under the heading \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAll forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur principal information, analytics and online marketplace services are described in the following paragraphs by type of service:\nCoStar\nCoStar\u00ae is our subscription-based integrated platform for commercial real estate intelligence, which includes information about office, industrial, retail, multifamily and student housing properties, properties for sale, comparable sales, tenants, space available for lease, industry professionals and their business relationships, industry news and market and lease analytical capabilities. CoStar's revenue growth rates increased in 2021 compared to 2020 as the average number of subscribers increased in 2021 compared to 2020 and we resumed annual price increases for contract renewals occurring in the third quarter of 2021 after a temporary suspension. We expect CoStar revenue growth rates to increase in 2022 compared to 2021 as a result of signing up new subscribers, existing subscribers upgrading their subscriptions and the resumption of annual price increases.\nInformation services\nWe provide real estate and lease management technology solutions, including lease administration, lease accounting and abstraction services, through our CoStar Real Estate Manager\u00ae service offerings, as well as portfolio and debt analysis, management and reporting capabilities through our CoStar Investment Analysis and CoStar Risk Analytics\u00ae service offerings. We also provide analytics and benchmarking reports for the hospitality industry. STARTM reports are provided on a subscription basis, but we also provide one-time or ad hoc reports or analysis on a transaction-basis. We provide information services internationally through our Grecam, Belbex and Thomas Daily businesses in France, Spain and Germany, respectively. Information services' revenue growth rates decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the STR acquisition in 2019 which resulted in a full year of results in 2020. We expect information services revenue growth rates in 2022 to remain consistent with 2021.\nMultifamily\nApartments.comTM is part of our network of apartment marketing sites, which primarily includes ApartmentFinder\u00ae, ForRent.com\u00ae, ApartmentHomeLiving.comTM, Apartamentos.comTM and Westside Rentals\u00ae. Our network of subscription-based advertising services provides property management companies and landlords with a comprehensive advertising destination for their available rental units and offers renters a platform for searching for available rentals. Apartments.com also earns transaction-based revenue primarily from providing online tenant applications, including background and credit checks, and rental payment processing. Apartments.com has continued to successfully increase traffic to its network of sites, year-over-year, resulting in increased leads to customers. As leads per ad have increased, Apartments.com\u2019s lower priced ad packages are generating more leads than top-level packages were generating approximately one year ago. In addition, rental vacancy rates have declined relative to historical averages reducing demand for top-level packages. As a result, customers began selecting lower-priced ad packages in the second half of 2021. Consequently, net new bookings declined year-over-year in 2021 resulting in a decrease in the Multifamily revenue growth rates in 2021 compared to 2020. We have implemented a revised pricing strategy to align prices at each product level with the value of the leads delivered. We expect multifamily revenue growth rates in 2022 to decrease when compared to 2021 due to lower net new booking activity in 2021.\nLoopNet\nOur LoopNet network of commercial real estate websites offer subscription-based, online marketplace services that enable commercial property owners, landlords and real estate agents working on their behalf to advertise properties for sale or for lease and to submit detailed information about property listings. Commercial real estate agents, buyers and tenants use the LoopNet network of online marketplace services to search for available property listings that meet their criteria. This product offering also includes Realla in the United Kingdom and BureauxLocaux in France which was acquired on October 1, 2021. LoopNet's revenue growth rates decreased in 2021 when compared to 2020 as growth in the average price per listing declined in 2021 when compared to 2020. We expect LoopNet revenue growth rates in 2022 to decrease when compared to 2021.\nResidential\nOn December 22, 2020, we acquired Homesnap\u00ae, an online and mobile software platform that provides subscription-based access to applications that manage residential real estate agent workflow and marketing campaigns delivered on third-party platforms. On May 24, 2021, we acquired Homes.com\u00ae, a residential advertising and marketing services company primarily operating through its portal, Homes.com. We expect residential revenue for 2022 to decline when compared to 2021 due to the discontinuation of certain Homes.com products and services, which is expected to be partially offset by expected increases in sales of Homesnap products and services.\nOther Marketplaces\nOur other marketplaces include Ten-X\u00ae, an online auction platform for commercial real estate which was acquired on June 24, 2020. Also included is our BizBuySell network, which includes BizQuest\u00ae and FindaFranchise and our Land.com network of sites, which includes LandsofAmerica, LandAndFarm and LandWatch\u00ae. The BizBuySell network provides online marketplaces for businesses for-sale and our Land.com network of sites provide online marketplaces for rural lands for-sale. Overall, revenues in other marketplaces increased during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to two additional quarters of Ten-X revenue included in 2021. We expect other marketplaces revenue for 2022 to increase over 2021 as more properties are sold on Ten-X .\nSubscription-based Services\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from service offerings which are distributed to our clients under subscription-based agreements that typically renew automatically and have a term of at least one year. We recognize subscription revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our annualized net new bookings of subscription-based services on all contracts were approximately $217 million, $184 million and $210 million, respectively, calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from all new subscription-based contracts or upgrades on all existing subscription-based contracts, less write-downs and cancellations, for the period reported. Net new bookings is considered a key indicator of future subscription revenue growth and is also used as a metric of sales force productivity by us and investors. However, information regarding net new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. Revenue from our subscription-based contracts was approximately 93%, 95% and 96% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline in the percentage of our revenue from subscription-based contracts from 2019 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to the acquisitions of companies which contained a higher percentage of transaction-based revenue than our legacy businesses.\nFor the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our contract renewal rates for existing CoStar Group company-wide subscription-based services for contracts with a term of at least one year were approximately 92%, 89% and 90%, respectively, and; therefore, our cancellation rates for those services for the same periods were approximately 8%, 11% and 10%, respectively. Our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results. As a result, we believe that the rate may be a reliable indicator of short-term and long-term performance absent extraordinary circumstances. Our trailing twelve-month contract renewal rate may decline as a result of negative economic conditions, consolidations among our clients, reductions in customer spending or decreases in our customer base. Revenue from our subscription-based contracts with a term of at least one year was approximately 77%, 80% and 82% of total revenue for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline in the percentage of our revenue from subscription-based contracts from 2019 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to the acquisitions of companies which contained a higher percentage of transaction-based revenue than our legacy businesses, as well as, increases in our sales of shorter term advertising products.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWhile the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it did not materially affect our consolidated financial statements during 2020 or 2021. We are closely and continually monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, employees, customers and communities. We continue to monitor the guidelines and mandates provided by governmental and health authorities and plan to continue adapting our business operations when and as deemed appropriate to comply with these guidelines and mandates and to respond to changing circumstances. Most of our workforce has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and, where permitted, has returned to the office. We have resumed in-person marketing events and some business travel. The global workforce has been operating in an extraordinary and mostly digital and remote manner as the world adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, many working adults moved to different locations and adjusted to a different way of living. As we transitioned our employees back to the office, we experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, attrition among our workforce resulting in increased costs. Continued attrition or the inability to replenish and grow our work force may result in work disruptions in the future. Overall, the increased direct spend related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including office reconfiguration to enable social distancing and employee hiring and retention programs, has not been material to date and has had minimal impact on our financial position and operating results.\nIt is currently unclear how the commercial real estate industry will ultimately be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as businesses formulate and execute plans for employees to return to the office, implement hybrid work arrangements - allowing work from the office or home, or switch to all work from home. If the demand for office space decreases significantly, there could be a downturn in the commercial real estate market which may materially adversely affect many of our clients. A depressed commercial real estate market would have a negative impact on our core customer base, which could impact our customers\u2019 ability to subscribe and pay for our services and reduce demand for our services. Reduced demand and increased cancellations could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rates to decline and reduce our profitability.\nDuring 2021, excluding our multifamily service offering, which is discussed under Service Offerings above, our company-wide net new bookings and renewal rates for subscription-based services have returned to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, we saw improvements in collection trends along with improvements in the economy which led us to reduce our allowance for credit losses previously taken. Due to the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting economic impacts, we will continue to monitor these trends and the effect on our results of operations. Any anticipated changes in financial performance discussed in this report are based on our current observations and experience and involve estimates and assumptions. As the future extent and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unclear, our estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change and actual results may vary.\nThe effects of the pandemic have not affected our ability to date to access funding on reasonably similar terms as were available to us prior to March 2020.We strengthened our liquidity position through an equity offering of common stock in May 2020 and an offering of Senior Notes and amendment and restatement of our credit facility in early July 2020. See Note 11 and Note 15 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our equity and Senior Notes offerings in 2020 and the 2020 Credit Agreement.\nDevelopment, Investments and Expansion\nWe plan to continue to invest in our business and our services, evaluate strategic growth opportunities, and pursue our key priorities as described below, while we closely monitor the economic developments from the COVID-19 pandemic and manage our response to such developments. We are committed to supporting, improving and enhancing our information, analytics and online marketplace solutions, including expanding and improving our offerings for our client base and site users, including property owners, property managers, buyers, commercial tenants and residential renters and buyers. We expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, integrate and cross-sell services, integrate recently completed acquisitions and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research, sales and marketing organizations. We may reevaluate our priorities as the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact continues to evolve.\nOur key priorities for 2022 currently include:\n\u2022Continuing to develop and invest in residential marketplaces. Our residential team is creating new and improved tools to help consumers have a highly contextual experience when searching for homes supported by high quality media and in-depth attributes of homes and details of the surrounding neighborhoods, parks and schools and to help consumers collaborate with their agent and other consumers. We are also creating new and improved tools to help agents promote their residential listings, connect with buyers and sellers and streamline their daily workflow. In October 2021, we reached an agreement to create, maintain and market a consumer-facing search website and mobile app for the Real Estate Board of New York's Residential Listing Service. In accordance with that agreement, we are developing a\ncustom version of the Homesnap platform, branded as Citysnap\u2122, specifically for the five boroughs of New York City. To support the expanded product offering, we expect to increase our investment in residential products in 2022 by approximately $200 million. The most significant components of our investment are expected to be content development, marketing costs and technology resources.The increase in our investment in residential products in 2022 is expected to reduce our results of operations and cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. We plan to continue to monitor and evaluate these investments and adjust our residential business strategy and level of investment as we determine appropriate.\n\u2022Continuing to invest in CoStar, including:\n\u25e6Enhancing benchmarking capabilities. We integrated STR's data into CoStar in 2021 and continue to develop dynamic analytics for and additional coverage of hospitality properties. We plan to apply STR's benchmarking capabilities within CoStar;\n\u25e6Developing CMBS Analytics, which will aggregate loan and property data across covered markets. The initial CMBS Analytics release is expected to include loan origination metrics, distressed loan levels and maturity volumes, as well as detailed revenue and expense information. In later releases of this solution, we plan to include detailed prepayment information on disposed loans;\n\u25e6Continuing to develop a solution for lenders that leverages CoStar's Risk Analytics capabilities to support lenders with risk management, underwriting, surveillance and compliance reporting. Lender was released in beta in February 2022 and provides a focus on portfolio risk analytics and surveillance to help lenders meet regulatory and accounting requirements. Subsequent releases are expected to focus on loan origination and underwriting; and\n\u25e6Expanding our international presence by hiring managers and teams of field researchers in European markets.\n\u2022Continuing to improve and market our Apartments.com service offerings to create the best and most comprehensive consumer rental search experience as well as continuing to advance the digital rental experience that allows renters to apply for leases and make rent payments, and for landlords to receive and assess tenant applications online through a single platform. We seek user feedback as we work to improve our services and continue to aggressively market our multifamily listing services in an effort to attract consumers and, in turn, provide more value to advertisers. Our Apartments.com marketing spending is focused on enhanced brand awareness and search engine marketing. As we continue to assess the success and effectiveness of our marketing campaign, we will continue to work to determine the optimal level and focus of our marketing investment for our multifamily listing services for future periods and may adjust our marketing spend and focus as we deem appropriate. Apartments.com has been successful in generating increased traffic to the network and as a result is delivering increased leads per ad to customers. We have implemented a new pricing strategy to align the product level prices with the value of the leads generated. We intend to monitor our new pricing strategy to determine whether current pricing reflects the increased lead generation we are delivering to our customers.\n\u2022Continuing to invest in the LoopNet marketplaces. To support the LoopNet marketplaces, we implemented training and incentive programs for our existing sales team to increase sales of LoopNet advertisements, with a focus on brokers and property owners. We have enhanced the content on LoopNet.com (including high-quality imagery), seeking targeted advertisements and are providing premium marketing services (such as LoopNet Diamond, Platinum and Gold Ads) that increase a property listing\u2019s exposure, and adding more content for premium listings to better meet the needs of a broader cross section of the commercial real estate industry. We are continuing our plans to recruit and develop a dedicated LoopNet sales team to help support and grow the business. To generate brand awareness and site traffic for the LoopNet.com network, we expect to continue to incur costs in a multi-media marketing campaign, reinforced with search engine optimization efforts and will continue to work to determine the optimal level and focus of this marketing effort for future periods and may adjust the spend and focus as deemed appropriate.\n\u2022Continuing to invest in the Ten-X auction platform. We have integrated the Ten-X platform with both CoStar and LoopNet to expand the audience for Ten-X auctions to include our commercial real estate users. We also plan to enhance access to Ten-X's data room information from CoStar and LoopNet. To increase exposure of properties to be auctioned on Ten-X, we are allocating banner space on both our CoStar and LoopNet sites for advertising for Ten-X properties. We continue to execute our plan to expand the Ten-X sales force and focus on increasing the number of qualified bidders and the number of owners bringing properties to the site. To generate brand awareness and site traffic for the Ten-X platform, we expect to continue to incur costs in a multi-media marketing campaign, reinforced with search engine optimization efforts and will continue to work to determine the optimal level and focus of this marketing effort for future periods and may adjust the spend and focus as deemed appropriate.\nWe intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business in order to develop and distribute new services and functionality within our current platform or expand the reach of, or otherwise improve, our current service offerings. Any future product development or expansion of services, combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or corporate expansion, development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures. Any new investments, changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to experience reduced revenues or generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future. Any development efforts must comply with our credit facility, which contains restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow and may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business.\nFor further discussion of our Company, strategy and products, see our business overview set forth in \"Item 1. Business\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our public releases, investor conference calls and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures that we may disclose include net income before interest (expense) income, other (expense) income, loss on debt extinguishment, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. EBITDA is our net income before interest (expense) income, other (expense) income, loss on debt extinguishment, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We typically disclose EBITDA on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted EBITDA is different from EBITDA because we further adjust EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues for the period. Non-GAAP net income is determined by adjusting our net income for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business and loss on debt extinguishment, as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs, and then subtracting an assumed provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents non-GAAP net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of GAAP net income per diluted share.\nWe may disclose adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Also, in the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry.\nWe view EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share as operating performance measures. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income is net income. We believe the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA margin are net income per diluted share and net income divided by revenue, respectively. In calculating EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day-to-day operation of our business. We have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as a result of these exclusions. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share as a substitute for any GAAP financial measure, including net income and net income per diluted share. In addition, we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as our quarterly earnings releases, and compare the GAAP financial information with our EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when viewed with our GAAP results and accompanying reconciliations, provide additional information to investors that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business without the impact of certain acquisition-related items. We have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Due to these acquisitions, our net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation and other amortization, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs and loss on debt extinguishment. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation and other amortization, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs; settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business. We believe the disclosure of non-GAAP measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year without the impact of these items. We also believe the non-GAAP measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non-cash charges, such as amortization and depreciation, and other items, such as interest (expense) income, other (expense) income, income taxes, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, loss on debt extinguishment and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business, provides additional information about our cost structure, and, over time, helps track our operating progress. In addition, investors, securities analysts and others have regularly relied on EBITDA and may rely on adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income or non-GAAP net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry.\nSet forth below are descriptions of financial items that have been excluded from net income to calculate EBITDA and the material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to net income:\n\u2022Amortization of acquired intangible assets in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the diminishing value of any acquired trade names and other intangible assets and the use of our acquired technology, which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.\n\u2022Amortization of acquired intangible assets in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.\n\u2022Depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.\n\u2022The amount of interest (expense) income and other (expense) income we generate and incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows and outflows. However, we do not consider the amount of interest (expense) income and other (expense) income to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.\n\u2022Income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business. However, we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.\n\u2022The amount of loss on our debt extinguishment may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents losses from the early extinguishment of debt. However, we do not consider the amount of the loss on debt extinguishment to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.\nSet forth below are descriptions of additional financial items that have been excluded from EBITDA to calculate adjusted EBITDA and the material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to net income:\n\u2022Stock-based compensation expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents a portion of the compensation of our employees and executives. Determining the fair value of the stock-based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock-based awards. Therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.\n\u2022The amount of acquisition- and integration-related costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because such costs generally represent professional service fees and direct expenses related to acquisitions. Because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, we do not consider the amount of acquisition- and integration-related costs to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.\n\u2022The amount of settlement and impairment costs incurred outside of our ordinary course of business may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent gains or losses from the settlement of litigation matters or impairments on acquired intangible assets. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.\n\u2022The amount of restructuring costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent costs incurred in connection with a change in a contract or a change in the makeup of our properties or personnel. We do not consider the amount of restructuring related costs to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.\nThe financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share are amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs, stock-based compensation, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring and related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business. These items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted EBITDA together with the material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to net income. In addition to these exclusions from net income, we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non-GAAP net income. We assume a 25% tax rate, which approximated our historical long-term statutory corporate tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete items.\nManagement compensates for the above-described limitations of using non-GAAP measures by using a non-GAAP measure only to supplement our GAAP results and to provide additional information that is useful to investors to understand the factors and trends affecting our business.\nThe following table shows our net income reconciled to our EBITDA and our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the indicated periods (in thousands):\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods (in thousands and as a percentage of total revenue):\nThe following table provides our revenues by type of service (in thousands and as a percentage of total revenue):\n(1)As of September 30, 2021, Commercial Property and Land revenue has been further disaggregated into LoopNet, Residential and Other Marketplaces. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect this presentation.\n(2)For further discussion of our Company, strategy and products, see our business overview set forth in \"Item 1. Business\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2021 and Year Ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table provides a comparison of our selected consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n(1) As of September 30, 2021, Commercial Property and Land revenue has been further disaggregated into LoopNet, Residential and Other Marketplaces. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect this presentation.\nRevenues. Revenues increased to $1.9 billion in 2021, from $1.7 billion in 2020. The $285 million increase was attributable to increases across all of our primary service offerings, led by an $80 million, or 13%, increase in multifamily revenue. The multifamily increase was due to higher sales volume and upgrades of existing customers to higher value advertising packages earlier in 2021. Residential revenues were $75 million, and were solely comprised of operations from the acquisitions of Homesnap and Homes.com, which contributed revenues of $61 million and $14 million, respectively. CoStar revenues increased $58 million, or 9%, primarily due to higher sales volume driven by an increase in subscribers, as well as, subscribers upgrading their subscriptions, and the resumption of annual price increases for contract renewals that began in September 2021. Other marketplaces revenue increased $33 million, or 38%, primarily driven by Ten-X, which had an increase of $26 million due to two additional quarters of revenue compared to the prior year. LoopNet revenues increased $28 million, or 15%, as a result of stronger site traffic which drove an increase in the price per advertisement as compared to the prior year. Information services revenue increased $12 million, or 9%, primarily due to increases of $6 million and $4 million in revenue for our CoStar Real Estate Manager and STR service offerings, respectively.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased to $1.6 billion in 2021, from $1.4 billion in 2020. The gross profit percentage was 82% for 2021 compared to 81% for 2020. The increase in gross profit was due to higher revenues partially impacted by an increase in cost of revenues of $48 million, or 16%, primarily due to an increase of $48 million due to the acquisitions of Homesnap, Homes.com and Ten-X. These additional costs primarily consisted of personnel and data costs, and to a lesser extent, amortization, software and equipment costs and bank and merchant fees.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased to $622 million in 2021, from $536 million in 2020. The $86 million increase was attributable to a $46 million increase in marketing expenses, primarily driven by a $32 million increase in marketing agency spending, primarily for LoopNet and Ten-X, and to a lesser extent, increases in events, digital and other forms of marketing, partially offset by decreases in multifamily agency spending and search engine marketing. There was also a $34 million increase in personnel costs, primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Homesnap, Homes.com and Ten-X, and to a lesser extent, an increase in commissions expense for other products of $7 million, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in bonus expense.\nSoftware Development Expenses. Software development expenses increased to $201 million in 2021, from $163 million in 2020, and remained consistent as a percentage of revenues at 10% in 2021 and 2020. The $38 million increase in the amount of software development expense was primarily due to a $33 million increase in personnel costs driven by the acquisitions of Homesnap, Homes.com and Ten-X, as well as, increased headcount to support the development of our products, and to a lesser extent, a $3 million increase in software equipment expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased to $257 million in 2021, from $300 million in 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 13% in 2021 from 18% in 2020. The $43 million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the $52 million break fee and $8 million in extension payments that were recognized in the prior year in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement with RentPath, which was terminated in December 2020. In addition, there was a $14 million decrease in credit loss expense due to better than expected collections, resulting in updated assumptions regarding credit losses and a decrease in reserves previously increased due to uncertainty about the economic effects of COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $13 million in general and administrative expenses due to the acquisitions of Homesnap, Homes.com and Ten-X, as well as, increases of $6 million in software and equipment expense, $3 million in personnel costs, $2 million each in depreciation, professional services, occupancy and travel costs.\nCustomer Base Amortization Expense. Customer base amortization expense increased to $75 million in 2021, from $62 million in 2020, and remained consistent as a percentage of revenues at 4% in 2021 and 2020. The increase in customer base amortization expense was primarily due to the acquisitions of Homesnap, Homes.com and Ten-X.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense, net was $32 million in 2021, as compared to interest expense, net of $17 million in 2020. The increase of $14 million in 2021 was primarily due to interest expense of $28 million recognized during 2021 on our Senior Notes issued on July 1, 2020 as compared to $14 million in 2020. In addition, there was a decrease of $4 million in interest income caused by lower rates of return on our cash and cash equivalent balances compared to the prior year, partially offset by interest earned on higher average cash balances. These changes were partially offset by prior year interest expense of $5 million incurred on the $745 million draw on our revolving credit facility in the first quarter of 2020.\nOther Income (Expense), net. Other income (expense), net was a net income of $3 million in 2021, as compared to net expense of $1 million in 2020. The increase in other income was due to rental income on the Richmond building, which was acquired in 2021, and to a lesser extent, increases in foreign exchange gains due to rate fluctuations.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense increased to $111 million in 2021, from $44 million in 2020, as a result of higher income before taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate for 2021 to 28%, compared to 16% in 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to a tax restructuring gain, as well as, a decrease in excess tax benefits. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of reserves for uncertain tax positions previously recognized.\nFor a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2021.\nComparison of Business Segment Results for Year Ended December 31, 2021 and Year Ended December 31, 2020\nWe manage our business geographically in two operating segments, with the primary areas of measurement and decision-making being North America, which includes the U.S. and Canada, and International, which primarily includes Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment EBITDA, which is our net income before interest (expense) income and other (expense) income, loss on debt extinguishment, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes that operating segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments. EBITDA is used by management to internally measure operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of the business. However, this\nmeasure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nSegment Revenues. North America revenues increased to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $276 million increase in North America revenues was attributable to increases in revenues for several of our services. Multifamily revenues increased $80 million due to higher sales volume and upgrades of existing customers to higher value advertising packages earlier in 2021. Residential revenues increased $75 million due to the acquisitions of Homesnap and Homes.com, which contributed revenues of $61 million and $14 million, respectively. CoStar revenues increased $53 million, primarily due to higher sales volume driven by an increase in customers, as well as, customers upgrading their subscriptions, and the resumption of annual price increases for contract renewals that began in September 2021. Other marketplaces revenue increased $33 million, primarily driven by Ten-X, which had an increase of $26 million due to two additional quarters of revenue compared to the prior year. LoopNet revenues increased $25 million as a result of stronger site traffic which drove an increase in the price per advertisement as compared to the prior year. Information services revenue increased $10 million due to increases of $6 million and $2 million in revenue for our CoStar Real Estate Manager and STR service offerings, respectively. International revenues increased to $67 million in 2021, from $57 million in 2020. The $10 million increase in International revenues was driven by growth in CoStar and STR, which were partially due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, and to a lesser extent, increases in LoopNet products, including the acquisition of BureauxLocaux.\nSegment EBITDA. North America EBITDA increased to $557 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $411 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in North America EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in revenue, partially offset by increases in personnel, marketing and general and administrative costs. International EBITDA increased to income of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from a loss of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to increased revenue and lower general and administrative costs, partially offset by increases in personnel and marketing costs.\nFor a comparison of our business segment results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019, see Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe the balance of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, which was $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company\u2019s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nDebt. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion of 2.800% Senior Notes due July 15, 2030. Future interest payments associated with the Senior Notes are $252 million, with $28 million payable within 12 months.\nLeases. The Company has lease arrangements for office facilities, data centers and certain vehicles. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $134 million, with $30 million payable within 12 months.\nPurchase Obligations. The Company\u2019s purchase obligations are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction and have an original term greater than one year. The services acquired under these agreements primarily relate to web hosting, third party data or listings and software subscriptions. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had purchase obligations of $95 million, with $40 million payable within 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others, our operating results, expansion and integration efforts and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions. To date, we have grown in part by acquiring other companies, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions.\nWe currently plan to expand our Richmond, Virginia campus which may result in a material cash requirement in 2022 and beyond. We continue to assess financing options for the project.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $71 million to $3.8 billion primarily due to cash generated from operations of $470 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan of $18 million, partially offset by, cash paid for acquisitions of $193 million, purchases of property and equipment and other intangibles of $189 million, including $123 million for the purchase of an office building and the underlying land located in Richmond, Virginia and corporate aircraft for $40 million, as well as, $33 million of repurchases of common stock from employees to satisfy the employees' minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock grants.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $470 million compared to $486 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $16 million decrease was due to a decrease in working capital of $141 million driven by payment of the $52 million termination fee pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement with RentPath in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by an increase in net income excluding certain non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes. We expect to increase our investment in residential products in 2022 by approximately $200 million, which is expected to reduce our cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $381 million compared to $464 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $83 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $233 million, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property, equipment and other assets which included $123 million for the purchase of an office building and the underlying land located in Richmond, Virginia and corporate aircraft for $40 million, and proceeds from the sale of our ARS investments of $10 million received during 2020.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $15.7 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to proceeds from our May 2020 equity offering, net of transaction costs, of $1.7 billion, as well as, proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Notes, net of transaction costs, of $983 million during 2020.\nAs permitted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, we deferred payroll taxes due in 2020; all amounts deferred were paid during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. The following accounting policies involve a \u201ccritical accounting estimate\u201d because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different acceptable assumptions would yield different results. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary. We consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:\n\u2022Long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill;\n\u2022Income taxes;\n\u2022Revenue recognition; and\n\u2022Business combinations.\nWith respect to our accounting policy for long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, we further supplement in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the following:\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and our ability to recover the carrying value of such assets. The accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors, including the factors listed below:\n\u2022Significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n\u2022Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n\u2022Significant negative industry or economic trends; or\n\u2022Significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period.\nWhen we determine that the carrying value of long-lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, we test for impairment.\nGoodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on October 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators.\nGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination and is calculated as the excess of purchase consideration paid in a business combination over the fair value of assets of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually by each reporting unit, or more frequently if an event or other circumstance indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. We may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or elect to bypass such assessment. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or we elect to bypass such assessment, we then determine the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate, growth rate and future financial performance. Assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies and determined by management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model. Assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. These assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions, commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate. Changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units' fair value and potentially result in impairment charges. Such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\nAs of October 1, 2021, we performed an assessment of the relevant qualitative factors for our North America and International reporting units and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its respective carrying amounts. There have been no events or changes in circumstances as a result of our qualitative impairment analysis on October 1, 2021, that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable.\nFor an in-depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe provide information, analytics and online marketplace services to commercial real estate and related business communities within the regions where we operate which primarily include, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The functional currency for a majority of our operations is the local currency, with the exception of certain international locations for which the functional currency is the British Pound.\nFluctuations in the British Pound, Canadian dollar and Euro may have an impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, revenues denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 4% and 5%, respectively, of total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our revenues would have decreased by approximately $7 million and $8 million, respectively, if the U.S. dollar exchange rate used strengthened by 10%. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our revenues would have increased by approximately $7 million and $8 million, respectively, if the U.S. dollar exchange rate used weakened by 10%. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of revenues denominated in any other foreign currencies would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated results. In addition, we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. We currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries. We may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully, on acceptable terms or at all. As of December 31, 2021, accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately $5.8 million.\nWe do not believe we have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. If there is an increase or decrease in interest rates, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. We currently diversify our cash and cash equivalents holdings amongst multiple financial institutions.\nWe are subject to interest rate market risk in connection with our new revolving credit facility. On July 1, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Credit Agreement, which provides for variable rate borrowings of up to $750 million. On July 1, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.800% Senior Notes due July 15, 2030. Changes in interest rates would not have a material impact to our current interest and debt financing expense, as all of our borrowings except for our credit facility are fixed rate, and no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of December 31, 2021. See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our 2020 Credit Agreement.\nWe had approximately $2.8 billion of goodwill and intangible assets as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable; however, changes in the economy, the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability. In the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired, we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset. We continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets.",

Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021 and were operating at a reasonable assurance level.\nWe continue to implement a financial system that is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operational and financial accounting processes. This implementation is expected to continue beyond 2022. Consistent with any process change that we implement, the design of the internal controls has and will continue to be evaluated for effectiveness as part of our overall assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. We expect that the implementation of this system will improve our internal controls over financial reporting.\nOther than the implementation of a new financial system noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We continue to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and our response to the pandemic on our internal controls so we can take appropriate actions to minimize any impact on the design and operating effectiveness.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of CoStar Group is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or supervised by, the Company\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures, that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn connection with the preparation of the Company's annual financial statements, management of the Company has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cthe COSO Framework\u201d). Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBased on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nErnst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company's financial statements included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn May 24, 2021 and October 1, 2021 we completed the acquisitions of Homes Group, LLC (\"Homes.com\") and Comreal Info SAS (\"BureauxLocaux\"), respectively. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we have elected to exclude the internal controls of these acquisitions that have not been integrated into our existing processes and controls from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. The excluded aggregate financial position of Homes.com and BureauxLocaux collectively represented less than 1% of our total assets as of December 31, 2021, and less than 1% of our revenues and total operating costs for the year then ended. We will include the internal controls of Homes.com and BureauxLocaux in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.",
