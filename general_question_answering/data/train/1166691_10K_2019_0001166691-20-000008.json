Sky has various contractual commitments for the licensing of rights to multiyear programming, primarily sports programming and exclusive entertainment programming. Our most significant sports programming commitments include the U.K. broadcast rights for English Premier League soccer games through 2022; German broadcast rights to Bundesliga and Union des Associations Europ\u00e9ennes de Football Champions League (\u201cUCL\u201d) through 2021; and Italian broadcast rights to UCL and Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A through 2021. Our most significant entertainment programming commitments include exclusive rights with HBO, Showtime, Warner Bros., NBCUniversal and The Walt Disney Company (\u201cDisney\u201d). Sky is also increasingly creating and investing in original scripted content that is broadcast across all of its territories and sold to other markets and we anticipate that our Sky studio production operations will also produce content for and license content to Peacock.\nIn addition to including owned channels as part of its video services, Sky distributes some of its owned channels on third-party platforms through both wholesale arrangements and arrangements with partners who distribute Sky\u2019s owned channels as agents to their respective customer bases. Additionally, Sky licenses owned and acquired programming to third-party video providers.\nAdvertising\nSky sells advertising and sponsorships across its owned television channels and where it represents the sales efforts of third-party channels. Sky also sells targeted advertising and generates revenue from online and mobile advertising and advertising across its On Demand services.\nOther Services\nSky offers high-speed internet and voice services in the U.K. and Ireland. Sky offers fiber-to-the-cabinet, standard copper digital subscriber line (\u201cDSL\u201d) broadband and fiber-to-the-home (\u201cFTTH\u201d) services, with download speeds up to 150 megabits per second in the U.K. and up to 1 Gbps in Ireland. In the U.K., Sky uses a combination of its own core fiber network and wholesaling arrangements over third-party telecommunication providers\u2019 networks as the core network and also accesses the \u201clast mile\u201d network from third-party network operators for a fee to provide its services to customers. In Italy, Sky offers video service with high-speed internet and phone services through co-marketing agreements with several Italian broadband and telecommunications providers, and plans to launch FTTH services using Open Fiber to provide high-speed internet access and voice services in 2020. Sky offers wireless phone services to customers in the U.K. using a combination of its own core fiber network and an arrangement to access network assets from Telef\u00f3nica.\nTechnology and Sources of Supply\nFor a majority of customers, Sky\u2019s DTH video platform is delivered via one-way digital satellite transmission for the distribution of linear television channels, augmented by a set-top box with local DVR storage and high speed two-way broadband connectivity to provide access to a broad range of On Demand and other services. The Sky platform also incorporates Wi-Fi connectivity for in-home distribution enabling wireless multi-room consumption, and Sky has also developed a range of back-end and client software applications that provide customers with access to its content across multiple third-party devices and On Demand in and out of the home. Sky\u2019s OTT video service is delivered via the internet.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nSky relies on various telecommunications providers to deliver video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellites leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, pursuant to the current regulatory regime in the U.K. and Italy, Sky is able to access networks owned by third-party telecommunication providers for a fee to provide its high-speed internet and voice services in most cases, on regulated terms.\nTo offer video services, in addition to its owned channels, Sky licenses programming from third-party programming providers that operate television channels. Sky attempts to secure long-term programming distribution agreements with these programming providers. The fees associated with these programming distribution agreements are generally based on the number of customers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which Sky provides the content. Sky seeks to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through On Demand services, mobile apps and streaming services.\nCustomer and Home Services\nSky\u2019s customer service operations are increasingly a digital first offering. The home service group performs various tasks, including installing, servicing and performing upgrades of customer premise equipment.\nSales and Marketing\nSky offers direct-to-consumer services to retail customers through customer service call centers, websites, telemarketing, a limited number of retail outlets, as well as through advertising via direct mail, television and the internet.\nCorporate and Other\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, such as the development of Peacock.\nCompetition\nAll of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes high-speed internet services more important to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been viewed by consumers. This increase has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines at our programming channels.\nCable Communications Segment\nCompetition for Cable Communications\u2019 services consists primarily of phone companies with fiber-based networks and direct broadcast satellite (\u201cDBS\u201d) providers that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours.\nHigh-Speed Internet\nCable Communications competes with a number of companies offering internet services, including:\n\u2022\nwireline phone companies and other providers of wireline internet service\n\u2022\nwireless phone companies and other providers of wireless internet service\n\u2022\nmunicipal broadband networks and power companies\n\u2022\nsatellite broadband providers\nPhone companies such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier and Verizon have built and are continuing to build fiber-based network infrastructure farther into their networks, which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional DSL technology, and are offering these higher-speed services in many of our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our high-speed internet services.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCertain other companies have launched FTTH networks that provide high-speed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate, and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiber-based networks.\nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types, including 3G and 4G, and recently 5G which is currently available in limited locations, wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks. These networks work with devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and mobile and fixed wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. A growing number of commercial venues, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, also offer Wi-Fi service. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized Wi-Fi and other internet access networks. The availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our high-speed internet services.\nVideo\nCable Communications competes with a number of different sources in the United States that provide news, sports, information and entertainment programming to consumers, including:\n\u2022\nDBS providers, including AT&T\u2019s DIRECTV and DISH Network, that transmit satellite signals to substantially all U.S. households to provide video programming and other information similar to our video services\n\u2022\nphone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, that have built and continue to build fiber-based networks that provide services similar to ours, which overlap a substantial portion of our service areas, and that in some cases provide bundled offerings that include wireless phone services\n\u2022\nOTT service providers including:\n\u25e6\nvirtual multichannel video providers who offer streaming services for linear programming that generally involve smaller packages of programming networks at prices lower than our traditional video service package offerings\n\u25e6\nsubscription video on demand services, such as those offered by Amazon, Apple, Disney, Hulu and Netflix, that offer online services and devices that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming\n\u25e6\ntraditional television and film programmers, networks and media companies that provide content directly to consumers\n\u2022\nother providers that build and operate wireline communications systems in the same communities that we serve, including those operating as franchised cable operators\n\u2022\nsatellite master antenna television systems that offer to their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems and generally serve multiple dwelling units (\u201cMDUs\u201d), office complexes and residential developments\n\u2022\nother companies, such as local broadcast television stations, that provide multiple channels of free over-the-air programming, as well as video rental services and home entertainment and gaming products\nMany of these competitors also have significant financial resources and have further intensified competition through mergers and acquisitions.\nVoice\nCable Communications competes with wireline and wireless phone companies, including incumbent local exchange carriers (\u201cILECs\u201d) and competitive local exchange carriers (\u201cCLECs\u201d), and other internet-based and VoIP service providers. Certain phone companies, such as the ILECs AT&T and Verizon, have longstanding customer relationships, and extensive existing facilities and network rights-of-way. A few CLECs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources. In addition, we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internet-based phone services, such as Skype.\nWireless\nCable Communications competes with national wireless phone service providers in the United States, including AT&T and Verizon, which offer wireless service on both a standalone basis or along with other services as bundled offerings, as well as regional providers of wireless communications services.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nBusiness Services\nCable Communications primarily competes with a variety of phone companies, including ILECs and CLECs and wide area network managed service providers. These companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier\u2019s network. We also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and VoIP companies that target businesses of all sizes. Our video monitoring services compete with companies that provide video surveillance services that use both traditional and cloud-based/digital solutions.\nNBCUniversal Segments\nCable Networks and Broadcast Television\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers\u2019 attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers, including cable, broadcast and premium networks; OTT service providers; local broadcast television stations; home entertainment products; pay-per-view and video on demand services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for on-air and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks, OTT service providers, and local television stations. The market for programming is very competitive, particularly for sports programming, where the cost for such programming is significant.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\nIn addition, NBCUniversal\u2019s cable television and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties, for creative, performing and technical personnel, and for distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content.\nFilmed Entertainment\nFilmed Entertainment competes for audiences for films and other entertainment content with other major studios and independent film producers, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of Filmed Entertainment primarily depends on the number of films produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Filmed Entertainment also competes to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors and producers, as well as scripts for films. We also compete with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of films in theaters and the distribution of films on premium networks, and with OTT service providers.\nTheme Parks\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. To help maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks, we have invested and continue to invest significant amounts in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing, China and Orlando, Florida.\nSky Segment\nSky competes with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe, including cable operators, providers of both paid-for and free-to-air programming, service providers making use of new fiber optic networks, other satellite television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, telecommunications providers, other internet service providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, companies developing new technologies and devices, and other suppliers and providers of news, information, sports and entertainment that deliver streaming, downloading and other online video services. Sky\u2019s competitive position may be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. Sky also competes with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\nSky\u2019s owned channels compete for the acquisition of programming content with a wide range of providers, particularly for sports programming, where the cost for such programming is significant.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nAdvertising\nCable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Sky compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital, radio and print media. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at the related networks, stations or channels. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. In addition, advertising revenue is adversely affected by the growing use of technologies, such as DVRs and video on demand services, which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or to fast-forward or skip advertisements within programming.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nEach of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications\u2019 results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\nRevenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains) are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, which affect Cable Networks and Broadcast Television, and the Super Bowl, which affects Broadcast Television. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively. Revenue in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Revenue at Sky has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World CupTM.\nRevenue in Filmed Entertainment fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. Content licensing revenue in Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees.\nRevenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Theme Parks generally experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the Christmas holiday season.\nSky results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our DTH and OTT video services, including the start of the new soccer seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the second half of each year due to higher marketing expenses.\nExclusive sports rights, such as local European and UCL soccer, Formula 1, and English cricket, play a key role within Sky\u2019s wider content strategy. In Europe, broadcasting rights for major sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality for Sky, although the staggered timing of major sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market. Certain of Sky\u2019s significant sports rights agreements require payments at the start of each season, resulting in increases in sports rights payments in the third and fourth quarter of each year.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nLegislation and Regulation\nThe Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d), and Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses that operate in the United States. These businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal, state and local authorities and to agreements we enter into with local cable franchising authorities. In addition, our international businesses are subject to the laws and the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate.\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome, and they, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews, regarding our services. In addition, regulators and the courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws as new competition law theories emerge. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. The U.S. Congress may consider proposals to address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace, whether it should enact new, permanent open internet requirements, and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.\nThe following paragraphs summarize the significant legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses, although reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC regulations and other legislation and regulations for further information.\nCable Communications Segment\nHigh-Speed Internet\nWe provide high-speed internet services to our customers. Many of these services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations or commitments described below. As an internet service provider (\u201cISP\u201d), we are also subject to a requirement to implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity. From time to time, the FCC considers imposing new regulatory obligations on ISPs. In addition, states and localities may consider new broadband-related regulations, including those regarding government-owned broadband networks. New broadband regulations, if adopted, may have adverse effects on our businesses.\nOpen Internet Regulations\nIn 2017, the FCC reversed its prior classification of broadband internet access service as a Title II telecommunications service under the Communications Act and classified it as an \u201cinformation service\u201d under Title I. In addition, it eliminated its prior rules prohibiting ISPs from blocking access to lawful content; impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services (\u201cthrottling\u201d); prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration (\u201cpaid prioritization\u201d); and generally prohibiting ISPs from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers\u2019 ability to access and use the lawful internet content, applications, services or devices of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging edge providers\u2019 ability to make lawful content, applications, services or devices available to consumers (\u201cgeneral conduct\u201d). The FCC stated that jurisdiction to regulate ISP conduct would rest at the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). In addition, the FCC revised the transparency rule to add a requirement that ISPs disclose any blocking and throttling practices, and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings. We have disclosed that we do not block, throttle, or engage in affiliated or paid prioritization, and have committed not to block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content. The FTC has authority to enforce these public commitments, and the FCC has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule.\nThe FCC\u2019s 2017 decision was challenged, and in 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia largely upheld the FCC\u2019s decision, including the classification of broadband as a Title I information service and repeal of its prior rules. However, it vacated the FCC\u2019s express preemption of all state Open Internet laws, but noted that state laws may nevertheless be preempted on a case-by-case basis if those regulations conflict with federal law or policy. Parties have sought further review of the court\u2019s opinion.\nSeveral states have passed or introduced legislation, or have adopted executive orders, that impose Open Internet requirements in a variety of ways, and new state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future. Certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court, and additional challenges may be filed. Such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations. Congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nand the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services. We cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed, the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation.\nBroadband Deployment/Infrastructure Initiatives\nIn 2018, the FCC adopted rules aimed at removing barriers to the deployment of broadband infrastructure, including the preemption of certain state and local laws or regulations that may unreasonably impede the deployment of wireless broadband networks. These orders are being challenged in federal court, and we cannot predict the outcome of the litigation. If the orders are upheld, some of these reforms may create regulatory imbalances that favor wireless services over wireline broadband services like our own. The FCC is currently considering additional measures that could result in further preemption of state and local laws or regulations as part of its broader efforts to accelerate wireless broadband infrastructure deployment. We cannot predict whether or how any FCC rules might be changed, how state or local laws or regulations may be impacted, or how such changes may affect our business.\nVideo\nProgram Carriage\nFCC regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its non-affiliation in the selection, terms or conditions for its carriage. In addition, cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d) in the United States are prohibited from requiring as a condition of carriage a financial interest in, or exclusive distribution rights for, a video programming network. We have been involved in program carriage disputes at the FCC, and increasingly in the courts, and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\nMust-Carry/Retransmission Consent\nCable operators are required to carry, without compensation, programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations. As an alternative to this \u201cmust-carry\u201d requirement, local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for \u201cretransmission consent,\u201d under which the station gives up its must-carry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator, which frequently will involve payments to the station. We currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations\u2019 broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. Failure to reach a retransmission consent agreement with a broadcaster could result in the loss of popular programming on our video services. For information on must-carry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business, see \u201cNBCUniversal Segments - Broadcast Television\u201d below and refer to the \u201cMust-Carry/Retransmission Consent\u201d discussion within that section.\nPricing and Packaging\nWhile the vast majority of our video services, including equipment and installation fees, are no longer subject to rate regulation by the FCC, certain state entities monitor and challenge the marketing and advertising of our services, and some have attempted to regulate the service packages we offer. We cannot predict the outcome of any current litigation with state entities or whether other states may pursue similar actions.\nFranchising\nCable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities. While the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, franchises typically last for a fixed term, obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality, customer service and other requirements, and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. Franchising authorities also may require adequate channel capacity, facilities and financial support for public, educational and governmental access programming, and other in-kind contributions. The Communications Act also contains provisions governing the franchising process, including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal, including unreasonable renewal conditions. We believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise. The FCC adopted an order in 2019 that prohibits state and local authorities from imposing duplicative franchise and/or fee requirements on the provision of broadband and other non-cable services over franchised cable systems, and ruling that in-kind contributions are treated as franchise fees subject to the statutory cap on franchise fees of 5% of cable service revenue unless those contributions are expressly excluded by statute. The order has been appealed, and we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation.\nVoice\nWe provide voice services using VoIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information, local number portability duties and benefits, disability access, E911, law enforcement assistance, outage reporting, Universal Service Fund\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\ncontribution obligations, rural call completion, customer equipment back-up power, service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements. The FCC has not yet ruled on whether VoIP services such as ours should be classified as an \u201cinformation service\u201d or a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under the Communications Act. The classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services. One federal court of appeals has held that VoIP is an information service and preempted state regulation of VoIP, but that ruling is limited to the seven states located in that circuit. State regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of VoIP remains unsettled at the federal level.\nWireless\nIn 2017, we began offering a wireless voice and data service. We offer this service using our MVNO rights to provide the service over Verizon\u2019s wireless network. MVNOs are subject to many of the same FCC regulations as facilities-based wireless carriers (e.g., E911 services, local number portability, etc.), as well as certain state or local regulations. The FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile broadband providers in the future, which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally.\nNBCUniversal Segments\nCable Networks\nProgram Access\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing MVPDs. The FCC and Congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with MVPDs and potentially with online video distributors; Maine has enacted a law mandating retail a la carte distribution by cable operators that, if upheld by the courts, may have similar effects. We currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled basis and, when requested, individually. We have been involved in program access disputes at the FCC and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\nChildren\u2019s Programming\nUnder federal regulations, the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks, broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children 12 years of age and under is limited, and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under.\nBroadcast Television\nLicensing\nLocal broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time, which may be renewed with or without conditions. The FCC renewed all of our broadcast television station licenses without conditions during the last license renewal cycle; the next television license renewal cycle begins in 2020. Although our licenses have been renewed, there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants.\nOwnership Restrictions\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations impose certain limitations on local and national television ownership, as well as limits on foreign ownership in a broadcast television station. In addition, each of the four major broadcast television networks - ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC - is prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four.\nMust Carry/Retransmission Consent\nEvery three years, each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its DMA either must carry or retransmission consent. A similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers. For the current three-year period, which commenced on January 1, 2018, all of our owned NBC broadcast television stations and our owned Telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent. The next three-year period will commence on January 1, 2021, with elections to be made by October 1, 2020.\nFilmed Entertainment\nOur filmed entertainment business is subject to \u201ctrade practice laws\u201d in effect in 25 states and Puerto Rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures. In countries outside the United States, a variety of existing or contemplated laws and regulations\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nmay affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products, as well as consumer merchandise products. The ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements.\nTheme Parks\nOur theme parks are subject to various regulations in the United States and internationally, including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection, privacy and data protection, consumer product safety and theme park operations, such as health, sanitation, safety and fire standards, as well as liquor licenses.\nSky Segment\nSky is subject to regulation primarily under Austrian, German, Irish, Italian, U.K. and European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) law, including telecommunications and media-specific regulation described below, as well as regulation under generally applicable laws, such as competition, consumer protection, data protection and taxation. Sky is currently, and may be in the future, subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Sky, we have made certain legally binding commitments with respect to Sky\u2019s operations, including for example, to maintain annual funding for Sky News in an amount no lower than Sky News\u2019 2017 fiscal year expenditures, as adjusted by inflation, until 2029.\nPlatform Services\nIn the U.K., Sky is required to ensure that agreements to provide its electronic program guide (\u201cEPG\u201d) and conditional access (\u201cCA\u201d) services to other programming providers are on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms, among other things, so that those providers\u2019 content is available on Sky\u2019s satellite platform via the EPG on Sky\u2019s set-top boxes. Sky also has voluntarily committed to the U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, to provide access control services to third parties that enable them to provide interactive services. Sky is subject to similar EPG and CA obligations in Germany.\nTelevision Channels\nSky holds a number of licenses and authorizations for its portfolio of pay TV channels. In the U.K., Sky is subject to various codes issued by Ofcom affecting the content and delivery of these channels. Sky also holds various nationwide broadcast licenses in Germany, Italy and Austria, and must comply with rules and regulations covering issues such as the acquisition and exploitation of sports rights, media concentration and plurality, television advertising, the protection of children, accessibility, airtime for commercials and teleshopping, sponsorship, and ensuring clear distinctions between program content and advertising.\nHigh-Speed Internet and Voice\nSky provides broadband and voice services in the U.K. and Ireland pursuant to wholesale distribution agreements that third-party broadband and telecommunications companies either make available commercially or are required to make available under applicable laws in those jurisdictions. Material changes to these regulations could affect Sky\u2019s business. Sky is also subject to EU open internet regulations, which prohibit the blocking, throttling, or discrimination of online content, applications, and services and require ISPs to disclose their traffic management, throughput limitations and other practices impacting quality of service in customer contracts.\nOther Areas of Regulation\nIntellectual Property\nCopyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary-rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution, and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, and through counterfeit DVDs, and other platforms, interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal protections exist to combat such practices, the extent of copyright protection is ambiguous and the use of technological protections are controversial. Modifications to existing laws, a weakening of these protections or their enforcement, or a failure of existing laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\nU.S. copyright laws also require that our video distribution business contribute a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material in broadcast signals under a cable compulsory license and that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute. The compulsory\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\ncopyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition, the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing, and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\nPrivacy and Data Security Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to federal, state and other foreign laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of consumers\u2019 personal information. In the U.S., the Communications Act generally restricts cable operators\u2019 nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers\u2019 personally identifiable information, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service, and responding to legal requests. We are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services.\nThe FTC generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices. We are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and under.\nIn addition, certain states have enacted detailed laws establishing consumer privacy protections and data security requirements in their respective states. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) gives California residents new rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of \u201cPersonal Information,\u201d as well as rights to access, delete, and restrict the sale of certain personal information collected about them. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and compliance with that law will increase the cost of providing our services in California. More generally, the FTC and state attorneys general regularly initiate efforts to update or enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information, which may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required. Additionally, all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which broadly regulates the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the EU. GDPR, and the Member States\u2019 legislation implementing the GDPR affect our ability to process certain personal data.\nPrivacy and data security legislation remained a priority issue in 2019. Attempts by state and local governments to regulate consumer privacy have the potential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations. Additionally, there are pending federal legislative proposals that, if enacted, could create new consumer privacy protections or impose new requirements on entities that collect and use consumer personal information, including us. We cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted at the federal or state level and, if so, the impact of any such laws on our business.\nFCC 5G Spectrum Proceedings and Other Wireless Laws and Regulations\nIn multiple regulatory proceedings, the FCC has established or is in the process of evaluating and potentially modifying its rules to make available additional spectrum that will likely be used for new 5G services. Cable Communications and NBCUniversal use some of this spectrum to provide our services and there is a risk that certain proposed rule changes could affect our ability to use such spectrum and could disrupt certain operations. We cannot predict what rules or legislation, if any, will ultimately be adopted or how any such changes would affect our businesses.\nState and Local Taxes\nSome states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing, through both legislative and administrative channels, new or additional taxes or fees on, or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by, the businesses operated by our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes, fees, incentives or credits are computed, earned or monetized. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments. In some situations, DBS providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a high-speed internet connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these DBS providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (\u201cITFA\u201d), which prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges, was made permanent by 2016 legislation; however, some jurisdictions may challenge the ITFA or the application of the ITFA to our business, or may assert that certain taxes akin to right-of-way fees are not preempted by the ITFA.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nU.K. Exit from the European Union\nThe telecommunications and media regulatory framework applicable to Sky and NBCUniversal\u2019s businesses in the U.K. and the EU may be subject to greater uncertainty upon the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. We cannot predict the extent of any potential changes to the regulatory framework involving U.K. and EU regulation of telecommunications and media, or changes to certain mutual recognition arrangements for media and broadcasting.\nOther Regulations\nU.S. states and localities, and various regulatory authorities actively regulate other aspects of our businesses, including accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities, customer service standards, inside wiring, cable equipment, pole attachments, universal service fees, public safety, telemarketing, leased access, indecency, loudness of commercial advertisements, advertising, political broadcasting, Emergency Alert System, equal employment opportunity and other employment-related laws, environmental-related matters, regulatory fees and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various international regulations, including those that cover television broadcasting, programming and advertising. We are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities, which can result in us having to pay fines or being subject to other sanctions.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 190,000 full-time and part-time employees calculated on a full-time equivalent basis. Of these employees, approximately 88,000, 66,000 and 34,000 were associated with Cable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky, respectively. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company\u2019s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d by words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d or \u201ccontinue,\u201d or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and in other reports we file with the SEC.\nAdditionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and, particularly in view of new technologies, the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any of such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.\nAll of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. OTT service providers continue to proliferate, complicating the competitive landscape by influencing consumer behavior and challenging existing business models, which is discussed in more detail in the risk factor immediately below.\nFor example:\n\u2022\nCompetition for Cable Communications\u2019 video, high-speed internet and voice services consists primarily of phone companies with fiber-based networks and DBS providers that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours. Sky faces competition for its video, high-speed internet and voice services from cable and telecommunications providers in its European markets, many of which offer customers bundled services, which has increased competition. Increasingly, additional companies, some with significant financial resources or fewer regulatory burdens, have entered, or are seeking to enter, the video distribution market by offering OTT streaming services or selling devices that aggregate viewing of various OTT services. Many OTT service providers offer smaller packages of channels or subscriptions to access programming at price points lower than our standard packages or for free, which adversely affects demand for Cable Communications\u2019 and Sky\u2019s traditional DTH video services, including for expanded video packages, premium networks, and DVR and On Demand services.\n\u2022\nCable Communications\u2019 and Sky\u2019s high-speed internet services compete primarily against phone companies with fiber-based networks offering speeds and pricing comparable to ours. Wireless internet services, such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services, satellite-delivered internet services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as smartphones, tablets, wireless data cards, and mobile and fixed wireless routers that connect to such services, also may compete with our high-speed internet services, particularly as wireless technology evolves. Some municipalities in the United States own and operate their own broadband networks and additional municipalities may do so in the future.\n\u2022\nNBCUniversal and Sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities.\n\u2022\nNBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, content and other resources required to operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming to attract viewers.\nFor a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the \u201cCompetition\u201d discussion within that section.\nConsolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas. For example, consolidation or cooperation between phone companies (which are also wireless distributors) and content providers may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services.\nThe ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, employees, investors and government authorities. Our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.\nWhile we continue to seek ways to enhance the value of our businesses, such as by growing high-speed internet services and business services and by investing in new theme parks and Peacock, there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or operating margins or to compete successfully in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nChanges in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. These distribution platforms have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nConsumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which is reducing the number of Cable Communications\u2019 video customers and subscribers to NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks even as it makes Cable Communications\u2019 high-speed internet services more important to consumers. These changing consumer behaviors also are occurring in Europe, as more of Sky\u2019s new video customers have recently subscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to Sky\u2019s OTT video service instead of its traditional DTH video service. Although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our high-speed internet services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms and Flex, which can more easily aggregate linear and OTT programming choices for our customers, the continuing trend of OTT service providers delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution services continues to disrupt traditional video distribution business models.\nThe increase in OTT service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. Time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our programming channels. Reduced ratings may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount that we receive for distribution of our content. In addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky\u2019s programming channels.\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\nA decline in advertisers\u2019 expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\nCable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital media, radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through OTT service providers, regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, or economic conditions generally. In addition, advertisers have increasingly shifted their expenditures to digital media and their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which many of NBCUniversal\u2019s networks and some of Sky\u2019s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. For example, certain methods of viewing content, such as through OTT services or delayed viewing through DVR or on demand services, might not be counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue.\nOur businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.\nOur success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors\u2019 use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability, and some companies and municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. We expect other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of Flex and Sky Q set-top boxes and wireless gateways. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors\u2019 product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the high-speed internet, video and voice services industries. Our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by U.S. laws and regulations. NBCUniversal\u2019s other businesses are also subject to various other laws and regulations at the international, federal, state and local levels. Sky\u2019s business is subject to various telecommunications and media-specific regulations where it operates. The FCC, FTC and certain state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities also have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services, and this trend likely will continue. In addition, regulators and the courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws as new competition law theories emerge. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability.\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government, including foreign authorities, frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statues, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may address communications and other issues that could significantly affect our businesses. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings regarding our services, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome. For example, some states have passed or introduced legislation or executive orders that impose various open internet and data privacy requirements. Such attempts by the states to regulate portions of our businesses have the potential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations. These requirements and any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the \u201cLegislation and Regulation\u201d discussion within that section.\nProgramming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications\u2019 and Sky\u2019s video businesses.\nWe expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Cable Communications and Sky segments and to increase for the foreseeable future. Our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms, such as on demand or streaming services. Additionally, Cable Communications pays certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers\u2019 rates or offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services or cost management initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications and Sky segments\u2019 results of operations.\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, if renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of Cable Communications\u2019 or Sky\u2019s video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\nNBCUniversal and Sky create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content at NBCUniversal and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. We also are incurring significant costs to develop Peacock, and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace this offering.\nNBCUniversal and Sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. We also may be unable to license popular third-party content for NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nprogramming channels if media companies launch successful OTT services for their owned content such that they forgo license fees from us and only provide their content directly to consumers.\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability of NBCUniversal to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses may be adversely affected.\nThe loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers. Sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers.\nIncreasingly, NBCUniversal and Sky are entering into agreements to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platforms, including OTT services. If this programming does not attract sufficient viewers, traditional and virtual multichannel video providers may not distribute NBCUniversal\u2019s or Sky\u2019s programming, and OTT services may not license programming NBCUniversal or Sky creates. In addition, we expect not to license certain popular content, and we may decide not to license additional popular content that we own, to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through Peacock, which would result in foregone licensing revenue.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where it does not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of its owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either \u201cmust-carry\u201d status, in which the distributor\u2019s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or \u201cretransmission consent,\u201d in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor. For the current three-year period, which commenced on January 1, 2018, all of our owned NBC broadcast television stations and our owned Telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent. However, certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us.\nThere can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms. The inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses.\nLess favorable telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky\u2019s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky\u2019s businesses.\nSky relies on various third-party telecommunications providers to deliver its video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellites leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, pursuant to the current regulatory regimes in the U.K. and Italy, Sky is able to access networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers to offer its high-speed internet and phone services, in most cases, on regulated terms, including price. If there is a change in regulation in the U.K, Italy or other markets where Sky accesses networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers, the regulated terms could become less favorable. Moreover, while Sky is able to receive wholesale fiber access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, pricing terms are not regulated. As a result, if Sky is unable to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on commercially reasonable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, Sky may be unable to deliver some of its services to customers in one or more of the countries in which it operates, which would adversely affect Sky\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations, and programming delivery, and technology embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies. Network, information systems and technology-related events, including those caused by us, such as process breakdowns, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or power outages, natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, a reduction in demand for our theme parks, disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services or satellite transmission signals, the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment, data, properties and reputation. In addition, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires have impacted our services, products and properties from time to time in the past and will in the future. The occurrence of these events may result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future, and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, we obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third parties, in connection with our business. While we generally obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our third-party\u2019s information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, could lead to litigation or could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules.\nThe risk of systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses, and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring, due to the nature of our businesses and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts by third parties to cause such systems-related events and security breaches and to identify our security architecture or system design vulnerabilities. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate an extensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly. Despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches, we have experienced systems-related events and breaches in the past, and there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses, and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.\nPiracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nthe creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. It also presents similar challenges for Sky\u2019s businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.\nWe may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.\nWe depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.\nWeak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, customers may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe, or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of Cable Communications\u2019 or Sky\u2019s services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as OTT video services, or substitute services for high-speed internet and voice services, such as mobile phones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.\nWeak economic conditions and disruption in the global financial markets may also have an impact on the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us or increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Sky, we incurred and assumed a significant amount of additional debt. If our businesses are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions, we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding as quickly as expected. Further, a significant increase in interest rates or disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, and could increase the cost of our borrowings.\nAcquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\nFrom time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, including our 2018 acquisition of Sky and the development of Peacock and new theme parks. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. Additionally, federal regulatory agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound and Euro, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nrate fluctuations. Sky\u2019s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\nUnfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.\nWe are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. Greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.\nLabor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.\nMany of NBCUniversal\u2019s employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversal\u2019s collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.\nIn addition, our cable networks and broadcast television networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nThe loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nWe rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses.\nIn addition, NBCUniversal and Sky depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, if we need to make significant termination payments, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.\nOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.\nOur Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.\u2019s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency, pro forma Sky Adjusted EBITDA increased 12.2% primarily due to contract termination costs and costs related to a settlement in the prior year period.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOther\n\u2022\nCorporate and Other revenue decreased 35.0% to $333 million primarily due to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in the second quarter of 2018\n\u2022\nCorporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA losses increased 12.9% to $880 million primarily due to costs associated with the development of Peacock\n\u2022\nAnnounced Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service that will feature NBCUniversal content, which is expected to be launched in 2020\n\u2022\nEntered into a series of agreements in May 2019 with Disney, whereby Disney assumed full operational control of Hulu, LLC (\u201cHulu\u201d) in exchange for certain put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest, and in August 2019, we received proceeds of $5.2 billion from a collateralized obligation secured by the proceeds guaranteed under the put and call provisions\n\u2022\nRepaid $15.6 billion of debt, including senior notes and term loans, and net repayments of commercial paper, which were funded with cash on hand, proceeds from the collateralized obligation related to Hulu and proceeds from the $4.8 billion issuance of senior notes in November 2019\nCompetition\nThe results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes high-speed internet services more important to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been viewed by consumers. This increase has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines at our programming channels.\nFor additional information on the competition our businesses face, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors.

Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded adjustments to the purchase price allocation of Sky, primarily related to intangible assets and property and equipment. This change resulted in an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that increased depreciation and amortization expense by $53 million.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCable Communications depreciation and amortization expense decreased due to lower spending on scalable infrastructure and customer premise equipment, partially offset by an increase in support capital. NBCUniversal depreciation and amortization expense was flat in 2019.\nAmortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $2.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $824 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 (see Note 8 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements) and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011.\nConsolidated Other Operating Gains\nConsolidated other operating gains for 2018 included $200 million related to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in Corporate and other (see Note 10 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements) and $141 million related to the sale of a business in our Filmed Entertainment segment.\nConsolidated Interest Expense\nInterest expense increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in our debt outstanding associated with the financing of and debt assumed in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as a $56 million charge related to the early redemption of debt that was recorded in the third quarter of 2019.\nConsolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nEquity in net income (losses) of investees, net\n$\n(505\n)\n$\n(364\n)\n$\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net\n(187\n)\n(17\n)\nOther income (loss), net\nTotal investment and other income (loss), net\n$\n$\n(225\n)\n$\nEquity in Net Income (Losses) of Investees, Net\nThe change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to our equity method investments in Hulu and Atairos Group, Inc. (\u201cAtairos\u201d). The losses at Hulu were primarily due to programming, advertising and marketing costs, and higher other administrative expenses. Atairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of income. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments. The table below summarizes the equity in net income (losses) of Hulu and Atairos in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nHulu\n$\n(473\n)\n$\n(454\n)\n$\n(276\n)\nAtairos\n$\n(64\n)\n$\n(31\n)\n$\nRealized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities, Net\nThe change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to gains of $293 million related to our interest in Snap, which was sold in 2019, compared to losses of $268 million in 2018, and unrealized gains of $184 million related to our investment in Peloton Interactive, Inc. (\u201cPeloton\u201d).\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nThe change in other income (loss), net in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the recognition of $219 million of gains related to the dilution of our Hulu ownership and $90 million of losses due to the impairment of an equity method investment. See Note 10 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements and Note 9 to NBCUniversal\u2019s consolidated financial statements for further information.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nConsolidated Income Tax (Expense) Benefit\nIncome tax (expense) benefit reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. Our effective income tax rate in 2019 and 2018 was 21.6% and 22.2%, respectively.\nIn 2019, the effective income tax rate included $125 million of benefits related to state income tax adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2019.\nIn 2018, the effective income tax rate included the effects of an income tax benefit of $244 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability as a result of the acquisition of Sky and $128 million recognized during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of additional federal tax legislation in 2018, partially offset by $148 million of income tax expense due to state and federal tax law changes that were enacted in the third quarter of 2018.\nConsolidated Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock\nThe increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the redemption value of one of our noncontrolling interests.\nSegment Operating Results\nOur segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA for our segments is not a non-GAAP financial measure. We reconcile the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements and NBCUniversal\u2019s consolidated financial statements).\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2019, Comcast Cable\u2019s wireless phone service and certain other Cable-related business development initiatives are presented in the Cable Communications segment.

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For MDUs, including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our HD or DVR services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of December 31, 2019 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 196,000 and 7,000, respectively. Wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers\u2019 accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines.\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship\n$\n156.24\n$\n156.23\n$\n153.60\nAverage monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship\n$\n62.59\n$\n60.45\n$\n59.13\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services are also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship.\nEach of our services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services.\nCable Communications Segment - Revenue\nWe are a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. We generate revenue primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services, which we market individually and as bundled services. We also generate revenue from selling through our allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that is received as part of distribution agreements with these networks to local, regional and national advertisers.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nHigh-Speed Internet\nWe offer high-speed internet services with downstream speeds that range up to 1 gigabit per second (\u201cGbps\u201d) and fiber-based speeds that range up to 2 Gbps. We also deploy wireless gateways to customers that combine an internet and voice modem with a Wi-Fi router to deliver reliable internet speeds and enhanced coverage through an in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi network. Customers with xFi-enabled wireless gateways may also personalize and manage their Wi-Fi network remotely, which includes viewing and changing their Wi-Fi password, identifying which devices are connected to their in-home network, setting parental controls and schedules, advanced security, as well as other features. We believe our customer base will continue to grow as consumers choose our high-speed internet service and seek higher-speed offerings.\nRevenue increased in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the number of residential high-speed internet customers. The remaining increase in revenue in 2019 was due to an increase in average rates.\nVideo\nWe offer a broad variety of video services packages that may include premium networks, pay-per-view services and our On Demand service. Our video customers may also subscribe for additional fees to our HD and DVR services.\nRevenue was flat in 2019 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential video customers, offset by an increase in average rates.\nWe have experienced, and expect that we will continue to experience, declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures, and we expect that our video revenue will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs, such as promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments.\nVoice\nWe offer voice services that provide local and long-distance calling and other related features.\nRevenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential voice customers.\nWe expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline.\nWireless\nWe offer wireless phone services to customers that may choose to pay for services on an unlimited data plan or per gigabyte of data used.\nRevenue increased in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines.\nBusiness Services\nWe offer a variety of products and services to businesses. Our service offerings for small business locations primarily include high-speed internet services, as well as voice and video services, that are similar to those provided to residential customers, as well as cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and cloud-based services that provide file sharing, online backup and web conferencing, among other features. We also offer Ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options to medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, as well as advanced voice services, along with video solutions that serve hotels and other large venues. In addition, we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help them manage their network bandwidth.\nWe have expanded our service offerings to include a software-defined networking product for medium-sized and enterprise customers. Larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These service offerings are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations.\nRevenue increased in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the number of customers receiving our services and an increase in average rates.\nAdvertising\nAs part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that is sold through our advertising business to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us. We also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our digital platforms. We also provide technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry, which allow advertisers to more effectively\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nengage with their target audiences. Revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market, general economic conditions, and cyclicality related to political campaigns and issue-oriented advertising.\nRevenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue. Excluding political advertising revenue, advertising revenue was consistent with the prior year.\nIn 2019, 5% of our advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments, compared to 4% and 5% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above.\nOther\nOther revenue primarily includes revenue related to our security and automation services. We also receive revenue related to residential customer late fees and from other services, such as the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\nRevenue increased in 2019 primarily due to an increase in revenue from our security and automation services and the timing of the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\nCable Communications Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming Expenses\nProgramming expenses, which represent our most significant operating expense, are the fees we incur to provide content to our customers. These expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by content providers, the fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations, the number of customers we serve and the amount of content we provide.\nProgramming expenses increased in 2019 primarily due to an increase in retransmission consent and sports programming fees, partially offset by a decline in the number of video subscribers.\nWe anticipate that our programming expenses will increase at rates higher than those experienced in 2019, due to the timing of contract renewals in 2020.\nTechnical and Product Support Expenses\nExpenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities, as well as costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning, as well as the cost of wireless handsets and tablets sold to customers and monthly wholesale wireless access fees.\nExpenses increased in 2019 primarily due to expenses related to the continued development, deployment and support of our products and services, expenses related to the continued growth in business services, and increased costs associated with our wireless phone service. Wireless phone service costs increased primarily due to an increase in the number of lines.\nCustomer Service Expenses\nExpenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity.\nExpenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower personnel costs as a result of decreased customer call activity.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses include the costs associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings.\nExpenses were flat in 2019 primarily due to an increase in spending associated with attracting new customers, offset by the absence of advertising expenses associated with the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.\nFranchise and Other Regulatory Fees\nFranchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities under the terms of our cable franchise agreements.\nFranchise and other regulatory fees were flat in 2019.\nOther Expenses\nExpenses primarily include personnel costs, advertising expenses, and building and facilities costs.\nOther operating costs and expenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to increased costs incurred in the prior year as we continued to scale our wireless phone service, partially offset by higher personnel costs in the current year.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCable Communications Segment - Operating Margin\nOur operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. The most significant operating costs and expenses are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which increased 1.1% in 2019.\nOur operating margin was 40.1%, 38.7% and 38.5% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, particularly residential high-speed internet and business services, and on improving losses related to our wireless phone service and overall operating cost management. Losses from our wireless phone service were $401 million, $743 million and $480 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNBCUniversal Segments Overview\n2019 NBCUniversal Segments Operating Results(a)\nRevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(a) Charts exclude the results of NBCUniversal Headquarters, other, and eliminations.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n% Change\n2018 to 2019\n% Change\n2017 to 2018\nRevenue\nCable Networks\n$\n11,513\n$\n11,773\n$\n10,497\n(2.2\n)%\n12.2\n%\nBroadcast Television\n10,261\n11,439\n9,563\n(10.3\n)\n19.6\nFilmed Entertainment\n6,493\n7,152\n7,595\n(9.2\n)\n(5.8\n)\nTheme Parks\n5,933\n5,683\n5,443\n4.4\n4.4\nHeadquarters, other and eliminations\n(233\n)\n(286\n)\n(262\n)\nNM\nNM\nTotal revenue\n$\n33,967\n$\n35,761\n$\n32,836\n(5.0\n)%\n8.9\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\nCable Networks\n$\n4,444\n$\n4,428\n$\n4,053\n0.4\n%\n9.3\n%\nBroadcast Television\n1,730\n1,657\n1,251\n4.4\n32.5\nFilmed Entertainment\n1,276\n13.5\n(42.5\n)\nTheme Parks\n2,455\n2,455\n2,384\n-\n3.0\nHeadquarters, other and eliminations\n(690\n)\n(676\n)\n(746\n)\nNM\nNM\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n8,772\n$\n8,598\n$\n8,218\n2.0\n%\n4.6\n%\nPercentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCable Networks Segment Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n% Change\n2018 to 2019\n% Change\n2017 to 2018\nRevenue\nDistribution\n$\n6,790\n$\n6,826\n$\n6,081\n(0.5\n)%\n12.3\n%\nAdvertising\n3,478\n3,587\n3,359\n(3.0\n)\n6.8\nContent licensing and other\n1,245\n1,360\n1,057\n(8.5\n)\n28.6\nTotal revenue\n11,513\n11,773\n10,497\n(2.2\n)\n12.2\nOperating costs and expenses\nProgramming and production\n5,107\n5,357\n4,599\n(4.7\n)\n16.5\nOther operating and administrative\n1,499\n1,453\n1,326\n3.2\n9.5\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion\n(13.6\n)\n3.2\nTotal operating costs and expenses\n7,069\n7,345\n6,444\n(3.8\n)\n14.0\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n4,444\n$\n4,428\n$\n4,053\n0.4\n%\n9.3\n%\nCable Networks Segment - Revenue\nDistribution\nRevenue is generated from the distribution of our cable network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers and is affected by the number of subscribers receiving our cable networks and the fees we charge per subscriber.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n% Change\n2018 to 2019\n% Change\n2017 to 2018\nDistribution\n$\n6,790\n$\n6,826\n$\n6,081\n(0.5\n)%\n12.3\n%\nDistribution, excluding 2018 PyeongChang Olympics\n6,790\n6,590\n6,081\n3.0\n8.4\nRevenue was flat in 2019 compared to 2018, which included the revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.

Advertising revenue is primarily based on the price we charge for each advertising unit, which is generally based on audience ratings, the value of our viewer demographics to advertisers and the number of advertising units we can place in our cable networks\u2019 programming schedules. Advertising revenue is affected by the audience ratings of our programming, the strength of the national advertising market and general economic conditions.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n% Change\n2018 to 2019\n% Change\n2017 to 2018\nAdvertising\n$\n3,478\n$\n3,587\n$\n3,359\n(3.0\n)%\n6.8\n%\nAdvertising, excluding 2018 PyeongChang Olympics\n3,478\n3,445\n3,359\n1.0\n2.6\nRevenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to the absence of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.

In addition, our cable television studio production operations generate revenue from programming the studio produces for third-party networks and for subscription video on demand services.\nRevenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements.\nIn 2019, 2018 and 2017, 15%, 14% and 15%, respectively, of our Cable Networks segment revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. These amounts are eliminated in Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCable Networks Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nCosts include the amortization of owned and acquired programming, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, costs associated with the distribution of our programming to third-party networks and other distribution platforms, and on-air talent costs.\nCosts decreased in 2019 primarily due to the absence of costs associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.\nOther Operating and Administrative Expenses\nOther operating and administrative costs and expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses.\nExpenses increased in 2019 primarily due to higher employee-related costs and increases in costs associated with our various digital properties.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses consist primarily of the costs associated with promoting programming on our cable networks and digital properties.\nExpenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower spending on marketing related to our programming and digital properties, as well as the absence of spending on marketing related to the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.\nBroadcast Television Segment Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n% Change\n2018 to 2019\n% Change\n2017 to 2018\nRevenue\nAdvertising\n$\n5,712\n$\n7,010\n$\n5,654\n(18.5\n)%\n24.0\n%\nContent licensing\n2,157\n2,182\n2,114\n(1.1\n)\n3.2\nDistribution and other\n2,392\n2,247\n1,795\n6.4\n25.2\nTotal revenue\n10,261\n11,439\n9,563\n(10.3\n)\n19.6\nOperating costs and expenses\nProgramming and production\n6,547\n7,789\n6,440\n(15.9\n)\n20.9\nOther operating and administrative\n1,564\n1,547\n1,391\n1.1\n11.1\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion\n(5.9\n)\n(7.3\n)\nTotal operating costs and expenses\n8,531\n9,782\n8,312\n(12.8\n)\n17.7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,730\n$\n1,657\n$\n1,251\n4.4\n%\n32.5\n%\nBroadcast Television Segment - Revenue\nAdvertising\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising units sold on our broadcast networks, owned local broadcast television stations and digital properties.

In addition, our broadcast television studio production operations develop and produce original content that they license to broadcast networks, cable networks and local broadcast television stations owned by us and third parties, as well as to subscription video on demand services. The production and distribution costs related to our owned programming generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial network license, which means the subsequent licensing of our owned programming series following the initial network license is critical to their financial success.\nContent licensing revenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements.\nDistribution and Other\nWe generate distribution and other revenue primarily from fees for retransmission consent of our owned local broadcast television stations and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated local broadcast television stations, as well as from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services. The sale of our owned programming is driven primarily by the popularity of our broadcast networks and programming series and therefore fluctuates based on consumer spending and acceptance. Distribution and other revenue also includes distribution revenue associated with our periodic broadcasts of the Olympic Games.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n% Change\n2018 to 2019\n% Change\n2017 to 2018\nDistribution and other\n$\n2,392\n$\n2,247\n$\n1,795\n6.4\n%\n25.2\n%\nDistribution and other, excluding 2018 PyeongChang Olympics\n2,392\n2,135\n1,795\n12.0\n19.0\nRevenue increased in 2019 primarily due to increases in fees recognized under our retransmission consent agreements, which was partially offset by the absence of $112 million of revenue resulting from our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.\nBroadcast Television Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nExpenses relate to content that originates on our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, as well as owned content that is licensed to third parties. These costs include the amortization of owned and acquired programming costs, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, costs associated with the distribution of our programming to third-party networks and other distribution platforms, and on-air talent costs.\nExpenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to the absence of costs associated with our broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and the 2018 Super Bowl.\nOther Operating and Administrative Expenses\nOther operating and administrative costs and expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses. Expenses increased in 2019 primarily due to increases in overhead expenses, partially offset by decreases in employee-related costs.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses consist primarily of the costs associated with promoting our owned and acquired television programming, as well as the marketing of DVDs and costs associated with our digital properties.

Theatrical revenue is also affected by the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding distribution platforms.\nRevenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to the strength and volume of releases in our 2018 film slate, partially offset by the releases in our 2019 film slate. The following key titles released in each respective fiscal year were contributors to the drivers of changes in theatrical revenue:\nWorldwide Theatrical Releases\nFast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\nHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\nDr. Seuss\u2019 The Grinch\nSecret Life of Pets 2\nMamma Mia!

Revenue is significantly affected by the timing and number of our releases and their acceptance by consumers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of the exhibition of a film in movie theaters, holiday periods and the timing of competitive releases. The overall DVD market continues to experience declines due to the maturation of the DVD format from increasing shifts in consumer behavior toward digital distribution services and subscription rental services, both of which generate less revenue per transaction than DVD sales, as well as due to piracy.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nRevenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to higher sales of 2018 releases in the prior year period, partially offset by sales of 2019 releases in the current year period.

Here We Go Again\nOther\nRevenue is generated from Fandango, our movie ticketing and entertainment business, consumer products, the production and licensing of live stage plays, and the distribution of filmed entertainment produced by third parties.\nRevenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in revenue from consumer products and the absence of revenue associated with the sale of a business in 2018, partially offset by an increase in revenue from our movie ticketing and entertainment business.\nFilmed Entertainment Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nExpenses include the amortization of capitalized film production and acquisition costs, residual and participation payments, and distribution expenses. Residual payments represent amounts payable to individuals hired under collective bargaining agreements to work on productions and are calculated based on post-theatrical revenue. Participation payments are primarily based on film performance and represent contingent consideration payable to creative talent, to third parties that have entered into cofinancing agreements with us and to other parties involved in the production of a film. The costs associated with producing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future.\nExpenses decreased in 2019 due to higher amortization of film production costs in 2018 compared to 2019.\nOther Operating and Administrative Expenses\nExpenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses.\nExpenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to the absence of expenses associated with the sale of a business in 2018.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses consist primarily of expenses associated with advertising for our theatrical releases and the marketing of our films on DVDs and in digital formats. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters. As a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film\u2019s exhibition in movie theaters and may not realize profits, if any, until the film generates home entertainment and content licensing revenue. The costs associated with marketing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future.\nExpenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to higher spending on the marketing of releases in the prior year.\nTheme Parks Segment Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n% Change\n2018 to 2019\n% Change\n2017 to 2018\nRevenue\n$\n5,933\n$\n5,683\n$\n5,443\n4.4\n%\n4.4\n%\nOperating costs and expenses\n3,478\n3,228\n3,059\n7.7\n5.5\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,455\n$\n2,455\n$\n2,384\n-\n%\n3.0\n%\nTheme Parks Segment - Revenue\nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at Universal theme parks. Guest spending includes ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise. Guest spending depends heavily on the general environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on travel and other recreational activities.\nRevenue increased in 2019 due to increases in guest spending driven by new attractions, such as Hagrid\u2019s Magical Creatures Motorbike AdventureTM in Orlando, and also higher attendance due, in part, to natural disasters that negatively impacted attendance in Japan in 2018.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTheme Parks Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nExpenses consist primarily of theme park operations, including repairs and maintenance and related administrative expenses; food, beverage and merchandise costs; labor costs; and sales and marketing costs.\nExpenses increased in 2019 primarily due to higher costs to operate the parks and attractions.\nNBCUniversal Headquarters, Other and Eliminations\nExpenses incurred by our NBCUniversal businesses include overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives.

The pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the Sky transaction occurred on January 1, 2017. Pro forma data is also adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting and eliminating the costs and expenses directly related to the transaction, but does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined business.

Each of Sky\u2019s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA.\nSky Segment - Revenue\nDirect-to-Consumer\nRevenue is derived from subscription and transactional revenue from residential and business customers. Subscription revenue includes revenue from residential and business subscribers to video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, including OTT subscriptions and income from set-top boxes, wireless phone handset and tablet sales, installation, service calls and warranties. Transactional revenue includes the purchase of physical and digital content, OTT daily and weekly passes, and pay-per-view programming.\nRevenue decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to increases in customer relationships, partially offset by decreases in average revenue per customer relationship.\nContent\nRevenue is derived from the distribution of Sky\u2019s owned television channels on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and acquired programming to third-party video providers.\nRevenue increased in 2019 compared to 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased reflecting the wholesaling of sports programming, including exclusive sports rights acquired in Italy and Germany and the monetization of Sky\u2019s slate of original programming.\nAdvertising\nRevenue is derived from the sale of advertising and sponsorships across Sky\u2019s owned television channels and where it represents the sales efforts of third-party channels.\nRevenue decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased reflecting the impact of changes in legislation related to gambling advertisements in the U.K. and Italy that occurred in the third quarter of 2019, as well as overall market weakness.\nSky Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nExpenses primarily relate to content originating on Sky\u2019s channels. These costs include the amortization of owned and acquired programming costs, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, and on-air talent costs. These expenses also include the fees associated with programming distribution agreements for channels owned by third parties, which are generally based on the number of customers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided.\nExpenses were flat in 2019 compared to 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the cost of sports programming contracts.\nDirect Network Costs\nExpenses primarily include costs directly related to the supply of high-speed internet and voice services, including wireless phone services, to Sky\u2019s customers. This includes call costs, monthly wholesale access fees and other variable costs associated with Sky\u2019s network. In addition, it includes the cost of mobile handsets sold to customers.\nExpenses increased in 2019 compared to 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to increases in costs associated with Sky\u2019s wireless phone service as a result of increases in the number of customers receiving the service.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOther Expenses\nExpenses include costs related to marketing, fees paid to third-party channels where Sky represents the advertising sales efforts, subscriber management, supply chain, transmission, technology, fixed networks and general administrative costs.\nExpenses decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses decreased primarily due to contract termination costs and costs related to a settlement in the prior year, and a favorable settlement in the current year.\nWe anticipate that expenses will increase in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the launch of high-speed internet service in Italy, as well as continued acceleration of Sky Q across all of our markets.\nCorporate and Other Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n% Change\n2018 to 2019\n% Change\n2017 to 2018\nRevenue\n$\n$\n$\n(35.0\n)%\n(40.7\n)%\nOperating costs and expenses\n1,393\n1,772\n1,973\n(21.3\n)\n(10.2\n)\nAdjustment for legal settlement\n-\n(125\n)\n(250\n)\nNM\nNM\nAdjustment for Sky transaction-related costs\n(180\n)\n(355\n)\n-\nNM\nNM\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(880\n)\n$\n(779\n)\n$\n(859\n)\n(12.9\n)%\n9.3\n%\nPercentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.\nCorporate and Other - Revenue\nRevenue primarily relates to Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nRevenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in the second quarter of 2018.\nCorporate and Other - Operating Costs and Expenses\nExpenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the costs of other business initiatives, such as the development of Peacock and operating costs and expenses associated with Comcast Spectacor.\nExpenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to costs directly related to the Sky transaction and a legal settlement in the prior year, as well as the absence of costs associated with our arena management-related businesses. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in other costs associated with the Sky transaction, including expenses resulting from the replacement of share-based compensation awards and costs related to integration activities, as well as start up costs associated with Peacock. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA excludes Sky transaction-related costs and costs associated with a legal settlement.\nWe plan to launch Peacock in 2020 and expect to incur significant costs to develop and scale our direct-to-consumer streaming service.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nto fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance.\nWe reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation\n$\n13,057\n$\n11,731\n$\n22,735\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n3,673\n3,380\n(7,569\n)\nInvestment and other (income) loss, net\n(438\n)\n(421\n)\nInterest expense\n4,567\n3,542\n3,086\nDepreciation\n8,663\n8,281\n7,914\nAmortization\n4,290\n2,736\n2,216\nOther operating gains\n-\n(341\n)\n(442\n)\nAdjustment for Sky transaction-related costs\n-\nAdjustment for legal settlement\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n34,258\n$\n30,165\n$\n27,956\nConstant Currency\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance.\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year.\nReconciliation of Sky Constant Currency Growth Rates\n% Change 2018 to 2019\nYear ended December 31 (in millions, except per customer data)\nActual\nConstant Currency\nConstant Currency Growth\nRevenue\nDirect-to-consumer\n$\n15,538\n15,326\n1.4\n%\nContent\n1,432\n1,196\n19.7\nAdvertising\n2,249\n2,376\n(5.4\n)\nTotal revenue\n19,219\n18,898\n1.7\nOperating costs and expenses\nProgramming and production\n8,865\n8,406\n5.4\nDirect network costs\n1,746\n1,555\n12.3\nOther\n5,509\n6,173\n(10.8\n)\nTotal operating costs and expenses\n16,120\n16,134\n(0.1\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n3,099\n$\n2,764\n12.2\n%\nAverage monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship\n$\n54.41\n$\n54.98\n(1.0\n)%\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures, investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper programs provide a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. See Note 7 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our revolving credit facilities. As of December 31, 2019, amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion.\nComcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing the Comcast revolving credit facility. The financial covenant in the credit facility pertains to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility. We test for compliance with this financial covenant on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2019, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin. We do not expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant. In addition, the Universal Studios Japan term loans contain certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2019, Universal Studios Japan was in compliance with all of these covenants.\nOperating Activities\nComponents of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nOperating income\n$\n21,125\n$\n19,009\n$\n18,018\nDepreciation, amortization and other operating gains\n12,953\n10,676\n9,688\nNoncash share-based compensation\n1,021\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities\n(2,335\n)\n(1,313\n)\n(546\n)\nPayments of interest\n(4,254\n)\n(2,897\n)\n(2,820\n)\nPayments of income taxes\n(3,231\n)\n(2,355\n)\n(4,057\n)\nProceeds from investments and other\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n25,697\n$\n24,297\n$\n21,261\nThe variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily related to the timing of film and television costs and our broadcast of the 2018 Super Bowl at NBCUniversal, partially offset by the timing of collections on receivables and our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.\nThe increase in interest payments in 2019 was primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding, including the issuance of new debt in 2018 associated with the financing of the Sky transaction.\nThe increase in income tax payments in 2019 was primarily due to reduced tax payments in 2018 as a result of federal income tax overpayments in 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, purchases of investments, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort. Net cash used in investing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, cash paid for capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and purchase of investments.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures increased in 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, with a full year of capital expenditures for 2019. Sky capital expenditures totaled $768 million in 2019, reflecting the continued deployment of Sky Q and high-speed internet services.\nCapital expenditures in our NBCUniversal segments increased 19.7% to $2.1 billion in 2019 primarily due to an increase in spending at our Universal theme parks, including construction of an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida.\nOur most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our Cable Communications segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. Cable Communications\u2019 capital expenditures decreased 10.5% in 2019 compared to\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n2018 primarily due to lower spending on scalable infrastructure and customer premise equipment. The table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our Cable Communications segment in 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nCustomer premise equipment\n$\n2,659\n$\n2,917\n$\n3,337\nScalable infrastructure\n2,000\n2,555\n2,369\nLine extensions\n1,392\n1,484\n1,367\nSupport capital\nTotal\n$\n6,909\n$\n7,723\n$\n7,978\nWe expect our capital expenditures for 2020 will be focused on the continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our Cable Communications segment; increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential; and the continued deployment of wireless gateways, our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology, Sky Q, and international OTT platforms. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks, including the additional theme park being constructed in Orlando, Florida. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including acquisitions, competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, and the timing of new attractions at our theme parks.\nCash Paid for Intangible Assets\nIn 2019, cash paid for intangible assets increased primarily due to the acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, with a full year of expense included in our results of operations for 2019, and to a lesser extent, expenditures for software in our Cable Communications segment. Our Sky segment\u2019s cash paid for intangible assets totaled $707 million in 2019 and consisted primarily of expenditures for software development related to Sky Q and high-speed internet services. In 2018, cash paid for intangible assets consisted primarily of expenditures for software in our Cable Communication segment, and to a lesser extent, expenditures for software in our NBCUniversal segments.\nAcquisitions and Construction of Real Estate Properties\nAcquisitions and construction of real estate properties primarily included the construction of the Comcast Technology Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which was completed in 2019.\nConstruction of Universal Beijing Resort\nConstruction of Universal Beijing Resort includes costs related to the construction of the Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China. See Note 8 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements and Note 7 to NBCUniversal\u2019s consolidated financial statements for further information on Universal Beijing Resort.\nPurchases of Investments\nPurchases of investments in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to capital contributions to Hulu and Atairos.\nOther\nOther investing activities in 2019 were primarily related to distributions received from equity method investments. Other investing activities in 2018 were primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of an investment and proceeds from the settlement of derivative contracts.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of senior notes and a collateralized obligation. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from borrowings, including the financing of the Sky acquisition, partially offset by repayments of debt, repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, and dividend payments.\nIn 2019, we made debt repayments of $14.4 billion, including $6.1 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2021 to 2023, $5.2 billion of senior notes due 2020 and $3.0 billion of senior notes due 2019.\nIn August 2019, we received proceeds of approximately $5.2 billion under a term loan facility due 2024 which is presented as a collateralized obligation, the principal amount of which is fully secured by the minimum guaranteed proceeds under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. In November 2019, we issued $1.6 billion of senior notes due 2030, $1.35 billion of senior notes due 2039 and $1.8 billion of senior notes due 2050. The proceeds from the collateralized obligation and the senior notes were used to repay debt. In 2019, we made borrowings of $728 million under the Universal Beijing Resort term loan.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nIn 2019, we made net repayments of $673 million under our commercial paper programs and made net repayments of $615 million under Sky\u2019s \u00a31 billion revolving credit facility, which was terminated in February 2019.\nIn December 2019, we announced our election to exercise our option to redeem at par $1.49 billion of senior notes due 2046 in February 2020.\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Note 7 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements and Note 6 to NBCUniversal\u2019s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financing activities.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nEffective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $12 billion, which does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $2 billion remained under this authorization. Under the authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We have paused our share repurchase program in order to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky, and no common shares were repurchased in 2019 under the authorization. Under our share repurchase program authorization, we repurchased a total of 140 million shares of Class A common stock for $5.0 billion in 2018, and 131 million shares of Class A Common stock for $5.0 billion in 2017.\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $3.9 billion in 2019. We paid dividends of $3.7 billion in 2019. In January 2020, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.92 per share on an annualized basis. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nThe chart below summarizes our dividends paid in 2019, 2018 and 2017. In addition, we paid $504 million and $320 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.\nDividends Paid\n(in billions)\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nContractual Obligations\nPayment Due by Period\nAs of December 31, 2019 (in millions)\nTotal\nYear 1\nYears 2-3\nYears 4-5\nMore than 5\nDebt obligations(a)\n$\n103,100\n$\n4,274\n$\n14,535\n$\n14,362\n$\n69,929\nCollateralized obligation(a)(b)\n5,166\n-\n-\n5,166\n-\nCapital lease obligations\nOperating lease obligations\n5,626\n1,460\n1,046\n2,243\nPurchase obligations(c)\n66,559\n23,902\n17,571\n9,200\n15,886\nOther long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet(d)\n6,493\n2,011\n1,353\n1,044\n2,085\nTotal(e)(f)\n$\n187,734\n$\n31,245\n$\n35,090\n$\n30,879\n$\n90,520\nRefer to Note 7 and Note 17 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n(a)\nExcludes interest payments.\n(b)\nCollateralized obligation relates to a $5.2 billion term loan facility, the principal amount of which is fully secured by the minimum guaranteed proceeds under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. See Note 10 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n(c)\nPurchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. Our purchase obligations related to Cable Communications and Sky include programming contracts with cable networks and local broadcast television stations; contracts with customer premise equipment manufacturers; contracts with communications vendors and multichannel video providers for which we provide advertising sales representation; contracts to acquire handsets and other equipment; and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. Cable Communications\u2019 and Sky\u2019s programming contracts include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts, which we expect to be significantly higher because these contracts are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming. Our purchase obligations related to NBCUniversal and Sky include commitments to acquire film and television programming, and broadcast rights relating to sporting events, such as the Olympics, as well as obligations under various creative talent agreements, including obligations to actors, producers and television personalities, and various other television commitments. Purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments.\n(d)\nOther long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of mandatorily redeemable subsidiary preferred shares; deferred compensation obligations; and postretirement, pension and postemployment benefit obligations. A contractual obligation with a carrying value of $1.1 billion is not included in the table above because it is uncertain if the arrangement will be settled. The contractual obligation involves an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks. The arrangement provides the counterparty with the right to periodic payments associated with current period revenue and, beginning in June 2017, the option to require NBCUniversal to purchase the interest for cash in an amount based on a contractual formula. The contractual formula is based on an average of specified historical theme park revenue at the time of exercise, which amount could be significantly higher than the carrying value. As of December 31, 2019, the value of the contractual obligation was $1.8 billion, based on inputs to the contractual formula as of that date. See Note 17 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this arrangement. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.0 billion and the associated interest and penalties are not included in the table above because it is uncertain if or when these amounts will become payable. Our total recorded liability of $2.7 billion related to participations and residuals are also not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which these obligations will be settled.\n(e)\nOur contractual obligations do not include our commitment to invest up to $5 billion at any one time as an investor in Atairos due to our inability to estimate the timing of this funding. As of December 31, 2019, our remaining commitment is $2.2 billion based on the capital calls received as of that date (see Note 10 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements).\n(f)\nTotal contractual obligations are made up of the following components.\n(in millions)\nLiabilities recorded on the balance sheet\n$\n124,760\nCommitments not recorded on the balance sheet\n62,974\nTotal\n$\n187,734\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 9 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements and Note 8 to NBCUniversal\u2019s consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements, including the impact of the adoption of the updated accounting guidance related to leases.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCritical Accounting Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights, the accounting for film and television costs, and the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. See Notes 4, 8 and 12 to Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Goodwill and Cable Franchise Rights\nWe assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. When analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment for our reporting units in 2019. This assessment considered changes in our projected future cash flows and discount rates, recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required. Assets and liabilities resulting from a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced as the value of the businesses in a reporting unit increases and as the carrying value of the reporting unit decreases due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired long-lived assets over time. Goodwill in our Cable Communications segment and our NBCUniversal segments has resulted from the combination of legacy businesses and newly acquired businesses and as a result, the fair values of the reporting units are significantly in excess of the respective carrying values. The goodwill in our Sky segment resulted from our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018. Given this was a recent transaction, the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the Sky reporting unit.\nChanges in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.\nCable Franchise Rights\nOur cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. The amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. Typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. Often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. We currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the United States.\nWe have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nFor purposes of our impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three Cable Communications divisions or units of account. We evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.\nIn 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. At the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2018, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value of the Northeast, Central and West divisions by 29%, 46% and 58%, respectively. We also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment, including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our Cable Communications segment; market transactions and macroeconomic conditions; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.\nChanges in market conditions, laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.\nFilm and Television Costs\nWe capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. We amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses. We generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes the costs using the ratio of the current period\u2019s revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all sources (\u201cultimate revenue\u201d). Estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and, therefore, are updated regularly.\nOur estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film\u2019s initial release. These estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film\u2019s theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. Upon a film\u2019s release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.\nWith respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license. Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license. Once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms, revenue estimates for these platforms, such as U.S. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. Revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.\nWe capitalize the costs of programming rights for content that we license but do not own at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is made available for use. We amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast. We recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports programming rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. Advance payments for rights to multiyear, live-event sports programming are included in programming rights.\nCapitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. If the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost, we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production\u2019s fair value. The fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows, which are supported by our internal forecasts. Adjustments to capitalized film production costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nFair Value of Acquisition-Related Assets and Liabilities\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. In determining fair value, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. As part of the estimation process, third-party valuation specialists are engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities.\nOur judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and depreciation and amortization methods, have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For instance, the determination of asset lives impacts our results of operations as different types of assets have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets primarily consist of our estimates of fair value for finite-lived customer relationships and indefinite-lived trade names.\nCustomer relationships were valued using a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. This measure of fair value also requires considerable judgments about future events, including attrition, contract renewal estimates and technology changes.\nIn determining the estimated lives and method of amortization for finite-lived intangibles, we use a method and life that closely follows the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset.\nTrade names were valued using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. This measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes customer premise equipment as well as network assets, real estate, and other machinery and equipment.\nProperty and equipment was valued using the reproduction and replacement cost approaches as well as a cost approach for real estate. The reproduction and replacement cost approaches measure the value of an asset by estimating the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets and adjust for the age and condition of the asset. The cost approach measures the value of real estate through an evaluation of recent, comparable transactions or current listings of available properties.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations were adjusted to market rates using a combination of discounted cash flows and market assumptions, when available.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe maintain a mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. In order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt, we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policy.\nWe monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analyses. We do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions.\nOur interest rate derivative financial instruments, which primarily include cross currency swaps, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program. These cross currency swaps effectively change our current fixed interest rates to different fixed interest rates.\nThe effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments to our consolidated interest expense was a decrease of $49 million in 2019, an increase of $2 million in 2018, and a decrease of $5 million in 2017. The effect of NBCUniversal\u2019s interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to NBCUniversal\u2019s consolidated financial statements for any period presented. Interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on consolidated interest expense in the future.\nThe table below summarizes as of December 31, 2019 by contractual year of maturity the principal amount of our debt, effective rates, and fair values subject to interest rate risk maintained by us.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n(in millions)\nThereafter\nTotal\nEstimated\nFair Value as of\nDecember 31, 2019\nDebt\nFixed rate debt\n$\n2,267\n$\n5,801\n$\n3,735\n$\n3,839\n$\n6,226\n$\n69,020\n$\n90,888\n$\n102,819\nAverage interest rate\n4.4\n%\n3.2\n%\n4.9\n%\n2.6\n%\n3.3\n%\n4.3\n%\n4.1\n%\nVariable rate debt\n$\n2,188\n$\n3,324\n$\n1,847\n$\n3,824\n$\n$\n1,286\n$\n13,002\n$\n13,023\nAverage interest rate\n1.4\n%\n1.9\n%\n0.8\n%\n1.8\n%\n2.7\n%\n4.4\n%\n1.9\n%\nThe average interest rates on our debt in the table above reflect the effects of our derivative financial instruments. We estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on December 31, 2019, plus the applicable borrowing margin.\nAdditionally, we have a $5.2 billion variable rate term loan presented separately as a collateralized obligation that will mature in March 2024. We entered into a series of variable-to-fixed rate interest rate swaps on $3.6 billion of this term loan with average pay rate and average receive rate related to these interest rate swaps of 1.23% and 1.80% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of the term loan was $5.2 billion and the estimated fair value of the related interest rate swaps was a net asset of $34 million.\nSee Notes 1, 7 and 10 to Comcast\u2019s and Notes 1 and 9 to NBCUniversal\u2019s consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nForeign Exchange Risk Management\nWe have significant operations in a number of countries outside the United States through Sky and NBCUniversal, and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. These changes could adversely affect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of our non-U.S. dollar revenue and operating costs and expenses, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories.\nAs part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposure for transactions denominated in other than the functional currency. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as currency exchange rates fluctuate to protect the functional currency equivalent value of non-functional currency denominated assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted non-functional currency revenue and expenses. In accordance with our policy, we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 30 months. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had foreign exchange contracts on transactions other than debt with a total notional value of $6.3 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, including contracts at NBCUniversal of $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material.\nWe use cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. Cross-currency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency, which hedge currency exchange risks associated with foreign currency denominated cash flows such as interest and principal debt repayments. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges on $3.7 billion of our foreign currency denominated debt. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate estimated fair values of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges were a net asset of $373 million and $399 million, respectively.\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations. We have foreign currency denominated debt and use cross-currency swaps to hedge our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries. Transaction gains and losses resulting from currency movements on debt and changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are recorded within the currency translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The aggregate amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries that have been hedged using cross-currency swaps and foreign currency denominated debt was $14.0 billion and $15.6 billion, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate estimated fair value of the cross-currency swaps was a net liability of $373 million and $587 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were pre-tax cumulative translation gains of $339 million and pre-tax cumulative translation losses of $4 million, respectively, related to these net investment hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nWe have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign operations as of December 31, 2019, including our hedging contracts, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. For those assets and\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nliabilities, we then evaluated the effect of a hypothetical 10% shift in currency exchange rates, inclusive of the effects of derivatives. The results of our analysis indicate that such a shift in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our 2019 net income attributable to Comcast Corporation.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. We have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions. These provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold. The threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparty\u2019s credit ratings. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we were not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements, nor did we hold any collateral under the terms of these agreements.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

The consolidated financial statements presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management believes the Comcast consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, Comcast\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this report. The Comcast consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Comcast\u2019s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022\nPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets.\n\u2022\nProvide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors.\n\u2022\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that Comcast\u2019s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. The effectiveness of Comcast\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting of Comcast has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nAudit Committee Oversight\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has oversight responsibility for our financial reporting process and the audits of Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets regularly with management and with our internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm (collectively, the \u201cauditors\u201d) to review matters related to the quality and integrity of our financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting (including compliance matters related to our Code of Conduct), and the nature, extent, and results of internal and external audits.

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Comcast\u2019s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAcquisition of Sky Limited - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company obtained a controlling interest in Sky Limited (\u201cSky\u201d) for $39.4 billion on October 9, 2018 and finalized the purchase price allocation in 2019. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly,\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nthe purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified intangible assets of $19.5 billion and resulting goodwill of $31.3 billion.\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed included, among others, certain customer relationships, trade names, and contractual obligations. The fair value determination of these assets and liabilities required management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including future cash flows and discount rates as well as royalty rates and current market rates for trade names and contractual obligations, respectively. Given the judgments necessary to estimate the fair value determination, auditing these estimates involved especially subjective judgment and involved the use of fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the significant estimates and assumptions used in the valuation of customer relationships, trade names, and contractual obligations included the following, among others:\n\u2022\nWe tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the valuation of assets and liabilities, including management\u2019s controls over forecasts of future cash flows, assumptions of market rates for contractual obligations, and selection of the discount rates and royalty rates.\n\u2022\nWe assessed the reasonableness of management\u2019s forecasts of future cash flows by comparing the projections to historical results and certain peer companies.\n\u2022\nWe assessed the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions of current market rates for contractual obligations by comparing the rates to historical contractual rates and industry data for similar contracts.\n\u2022\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology, discount rates, and royalty rates by:\n\u25e6\nTesting the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and royalty rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.\n\u25e6\nDeveloping a range of independent estimates for the discount rates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\nFilm and Television Costs - Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company amortizes capitalized film and television production costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes such costs using the ratio of current period revenue to the total remaining revenue forecasted to be realized, also known as \u201cultimate revenue.\u201d In addition, the Company recognizes the costs of multiyear, live-event sports programming rights as the rights are utilized over the contractual term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. The estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on the rate at which capitalized costs are amortized.\nThe determination of ultimate revenue for capitalized film and television costs requires the Company to make significant estimates of future revenue based on anticipated release patterns, public acceptance, and historical results for similar productions. The determination of ultimate revenue for multiyear, live-event sports programming rights requires the Company to make significant estimates of future revenue based on historical and expected trends in the advertising market as well as the number of subscribers receiving or viewing the sports programming. Given the judgments necessary to estimate ultimate revenue, auditing these estimates involved especially subjective judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to forecasts of ultimate revenue for individual film or television productions and for sports programming rights included the following, among others:\n\u2022\nWe tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over its amortization of film and television costs and sports programming rights, including controls over forecasts of ultimate revenue.\n\u2022\nWe evaluated the historical accuracy of management\u2019s forecast of future revenues by comparing actual results to management\u2019s historical estimates of ultimate revenue.\n\u2022\nFor film and television productions, we tested management\u2019s selection of inputs and assumptions, including considering the historical performance of similar titles, factors unique to the individual film or television production, and third-party projections.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nJanuary 30, 2020\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1963.\nComcast 2019

Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the \u201cNBCUniversal segments\u201d); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. See Note 2 for additional information on our reportable business segments.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all entities in which we have a controlling voting interest and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) required to be consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nWe translate assets and liabilities of our foreign operations where the functional currency is the local currency, primarily the British pound, euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi, into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date and translate revenue and expenses using average monthly exchange rates. The related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheet. Any foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in our consolidated statement of income.\nReclassifications\nReclassifications have been made to our consolidated financial statements for the prior periods to conform to classifications used in 2019. See Note 9 for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to select accounting policies, including in certain cases industry-specific policies, and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe that the judgments and related estimates for the following items are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n\u2022\nvaluation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights (see Note 12)\n\u2022\nfilm and television costs (see Note 4)\n\u2022\nfair value of acquisition-related assets and liabilities (see Note 8)\nIn addition, the following accounting policies are specific to the industries in which we operate:\n\u2022\ncapitalization and amortization of film and television costs (see Note 4)\n\u2022\ncosts for connecting customers to our cable systems (see Note 11)\nInformation on other accounting policies and methods that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are included, where applicable, in their respective footnotes that follow. The collateralized obligation related to our investment in Hulu is discussed in Note 10 and our other long-term debt is discussed in Note 7. Below is a discussion of accounting policies and methods used in our consolidated financial statements that are not presented within other footnotes.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Our objective is to manage the financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivatives used to economically hedge them.\nOur derivative financial instruments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. We designate certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions, including cash flows associated with non-functional currency debt and non-functional currency revenues and expense. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item affects earnings. For derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nRefer to Note 7 for further information on derivative instruments related to debt. The impact of our remaining derivative financial instruments was not material to our consolidated financial statements in any of the periods presented.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe accounting guidance related to fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques. The levels of the hierarchy are described below.\n\u2022\nLevel 1: Values are determined using quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market\n\u2022\nLevel 2: Values are determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets\n\u2022\nLevel 3: Values are determined using models that use significant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation\nWe use these levels of hierarchy to measure the fair value of certain financial instruments on a recurring basis, such as for investments; on a non-recurring basis, such as for acquisitions and impairment testing; for disclosure purposes, such as for long-term debt; and for other applications, as discussed in their respective footnotes. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation and classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nNote 2: Segment Information\nCable Communications is a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, Comcast Cable\u2019s wireless phone service and certain other Cable-related business development initiatives are presented in the Cable Communications segment. Results were previously presented in Corporate and Other. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. We do not present a measure of total assets for our reportable business segments as this information is not used by management to allocate resources and capital. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\n(in millions)\nRevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA(d)\nDepreciation and\nAmortization\nCapital\nExpenditures\nCash Paid for\nIntangible\nAssets\nCable Communications\n$\n58,082\n$\n23,266\n$\n7,994\n$\n6,909\n$\n1,426\nNBCUniversal\nCable Networks\n11,513\n4,444\nBroadcast Television\n10,261\n1,730\nFilmed Entertainment\n6,493\nTheme Parks\n5,933\n2,455\n1,605\nHeadquarters and Other(a)\n(689\n)\nEliminations(b)\n(316\n)\n(1\n)\n-\n-\n-\nNBCUniversal\n33,967\n8,772\n2,129\n2,072\nSky\n19,219\n3,099\n2,699\nCorporate and Other(c)\n(880\n)\nEliminations(b)\n(2,659\n)\n-\n-\n-\nComcast Consolidated\n$\n108,942\n$\n34,258\n$\n12,953\n$\n9,953\n$\n2,475\n(in millions)\nRevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA(d)\nDepreciation and\nAmortization\nCapital\nExpenditures\nCash Paid for\nIntangible\nAssets\nCable Communications\n$\n56,033\n$\n21,681\n$\n8,262\n$\n7,723\n$\n1,346\nNBCUniversal\nCable Networks(e)\n11,773\n4,428\nBroadcast Television(e)\n11,439\n1,657\nFilmed Entertainment\n7,152\nTheme Parks\n5,683\n2,455\n1,143\nHeadquarters and Other(a)\n(680\n)\nEliminations(b)(e)\n(349\n)\n-\n-\n-\nNBCUniversal\n35,761\n8,598\n2,108\n1,730\nSky\n4,587\nCorporate and Other(c)\n(779\n)\nEliminations(b)(e)\n(2,387\n)\n(27\n)\n-\n-\n-\nComcast Consolidated\n$\n94,507\n$\n30,165\n$\n11,017\n$\n9,774\n$\n1,935\n(in millions)\nRevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA(d)\nDepreciation and\nAmortization\nCapital\nExpenditures\nCash Paid for\nIntangible\nAssets\nCable Communications\n$\n53,399\n$\n20,555\n$\n8,019\n$\n7,978\n$\n1,294\nNBCUniversal\nCable Networks\n10,497\n4,053\nBroadcast Television\n9,563\n1,251\nFilmed Entertainment\n7,595\n1,276\nTheme Parks\n5,443\n2,384\nHeadquarters and Other(a)\n(741\n)\nEliminations(b)\n(307\n)\n(5\n)\n-\n-\n-\nNBCUniversal\n32,836\n8,218\n2,041\n1,502\nCorporate and Other(c)\n(859\n)\nEliminations(b)\n(2,070\n)\n-\n-\n-\nComcast Consolidated\n$\n85,029\n$\n27,956\n$\n10,130\n$\n9,550\n$\n1,605\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\n(a)\nNBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives.\n(b)\nIncluded in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n34,258\n$\n30,165\n$\n27,956\nAdjustment for legal settlement\n-\n(125\n)\n(250\n)\nAdjustment for Sky transaction-related costs\n(180\n)\n(355\n)\n-\nDepreciation\n(8,663\n)\n(8,281\n)\n(7,914\n)\nAmortization\n(4,290\n)\n(2,736\n)\n(2,216\n)\nOther operating gains\n-\nInterest expense\n(4,567\n)\n(3,542\n)\n(3,086\n)\nInvestment and other income (loss), net\n(225\n)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n16,996\n$\n15,242\n$\n15,353\n(e)\nThe revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics were reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television.

Revenue from customers that purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is allocated between the separate services based on the respective stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the current prices at which we separately sell the services. Significant judgment is used to determine performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and the allocation of revenue when services are combined in a bundle. Revenue related to our security and automation services is reported in other revenue.\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Subscription rates and related charges vary according to the services and features customers receive. Customers are typically billed in advance and pay on a monthly basis. Installation fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of benefit to the customer, which is less than a year for residential customers. While a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are typically 1 to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services on a basis that is consistent with our customers that are not subject to contracts. Our services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as set-top boxes, cable modems and wireless gateways. The timing and pattern of recognition for customer premise equipment revenue are consistent with those of our services. We recognize revenue from the sale of wireless handsets at the point of sale. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year.\nUnder the terms of cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue. We generally pass these and other similar fees through to our customers and classify these fees in the respective Cable Communications services revenue, with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.\nBusiness Services\nRevenue is generated from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our service offerings for small business locations primarily include high-speed internet services, as well as voice and video services, that are similar to those provided to residential customers, as well as cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and cloud-based services that provide file sharing, online backup and web conferencing, among other features. We also offer Ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options to medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, as well as advanced voice services, along with video solutions that serve hotels and other large venues. In addition, we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help them manage their network bandwidth.\nWe have expanded our service offerings to include a software-defined networking product for medium-sized and enterprise customers. Larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These service offerings are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations both within and outside of our cable distribution footprint, where we have agreements with other companies to use their networks to provide coverage outside of our service areas.\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging from 2 years for small and medium-sized businesses to up to 5 years for larger enterprises. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual business services revenue, of which the substantial majority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers with contracts may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We receive payments based on a billing schedule established in our contracts, which is typically on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\nAdvertising\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to multichannel video providers in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on digital platforms. We enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nspecifically identified and the timing of airing is scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from when advertisements are aired or viewed. In addition, we also provide technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry, which allows advertisers to more effectively engage with their target audiences. Revenue earned in this manner is recognized when services are provided.\nNBCUniversal Segments\nDistribution\nCable Networks generates revenue from the distribution of our cable network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. Broadcast Television generates revenue from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated local broadcast television stations.\nThese arrangements are accounted for as licenses of functional intellectual property and revenue is recognized as programming is provided on a monthly basis, generally under multiyear agreements. Monthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally based on the number of subscribers. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment within 60 days.\nAdvertising\nCable Networks and Broadcast Television generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our cable and broadcast networks, our owned local broadcast television stations and various digital properties.\nWe enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and the timing of airing is scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days. In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in contracts where the ratings were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\nTheatrical\nFilmed Entertainment generates revenue from the worldwide theatrical release of produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. Theatrical revenue is affected by the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters and their acceptance by audiences. It is also affected by the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time when films are released. We recognize revenue as the films are viewed and exhibited in theaters and payment generally occurs within 30 days after exhibition.\nContent Licensing\nCable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment generate revenue from the licensing of our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to cable, broadcast and premium networks and subscription video on demand services. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film\u2019s theatrical release, Filmed Entertainment may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue at the later of when the content is available or when the renewal or extension period begins. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements at any given time equals approximately 1 to 2 years of annual Filmed Entertainment content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this future revenue. The majority of this revenue will be recognized within 2 years. This amount may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a subscription video on demand service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\nHome Entertainment\nFilmed Entertainment generates revenue from the sale of our produced and acquired films on standard-definition digital video discs and Blu-ray discs (together, \u201cDVDs\u201d) and through digital distribution services. Cable Networks and Broadcast Television\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nalso generate revenue from the sale of owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services, which is reported in other revenue. We generally recognize revenue from DVD sales, net of estimated returns and customer incentives, on the date that DVDs are delivered to and made available for sale by retailers. Payment terms generally include payment within 60 to 90 days from delivery to the retailer.\nTheme Parks\nTheme Parks generates revenue primarily from guest spending at our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. Guest spending includes ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise. We recognize revenue from ticket sales when the tickets are used, generally within a year from the date of purchase. For annual passes, we generally recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the period the pass is available to be used. We recognize revenue from in-park spending at the point of sale.\nSky Segment\nDirect-to-Consumer\nRevenue is generated from subscribers to our video services from both residential and business customers. We also provide high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services in select countries. Generally, all of our residential customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging from rolling monthly to 2 years, depending on the product and territory, and may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. Subscription rates and related charges vary according to the services and features customers receive and the types of equipment they use. Our video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services generally may be purchased individually or in bundles. We recognize revenue from video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services as the services are provided on a monthly basis. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to existing agreements is equal to less than half of our annual direct-to-consumer revenue, which generally will be recognized within 2 years.\nContent\nRevenue is generated from the distribution of our television channels on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and acquired programming to third-party video providers. See the NBCUniversal segment discussion of distribution and content licensing revenue above for accounting policies for these types of arrangements.\nAdvertising\nRevenue is generated from advertising and sponsorships across our owned television channels and where we represent the sales efforts of third-party channels. We also sell targeted advertising and generate revenue from online and mobile advertising and advertising across our On Demand services. Revenue is recognized when the advertising is aired or viewed. Since we are acting as the principal in the arrangements where we represent the sales efforts of third parties, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to the third-party channels in other operating and administrative expenses.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nThe following tables summarize our accounts receivable and other balances that are not separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet that relate to the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash, as well as deferred costs associated with our contracts with customers.\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nReceivables, gross\n$\n11,711\n$\n11,456\nLess: Allowance for doubtful accounts\nReceivables, net\n$\n11,292\n$\n11,104\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nNoncurrent receivables (included in other noncurrent assets, net)\n$\n1,337\n$\n1,399\nContract acquisition and fulfillment costs (included in other noncurrent assets, net)\n$\n1,083\n$\nNoncurrent deferred revenue (included in other noncurrent liabilities)\n$\n$\nIn Cable Communications and Sky, we manage credit risk by screening applicants through the use of internal customer information, identification verification tools and credit bureau data, as well as by offering customers the opportunity to establish automatic monthly payments. If a customer\u2019s account is delinquent, various measures are used to collect outstanding amounts, including termination of the customer\u2019s services.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nNote 4: Programming and Production Costs\nVideo Distribution Programming Expenses\nProgramming expenses for Cable Communications and Sky are the fees we pay to license the programming we distribute to our customers. Programming is generally acquired under multiyear distribution agreements, with rates typically based on the number of customers that receive the programming and the extent of distribution. From time to time, these contracts expire and programming continues to be provided under interim arrangements while the parties negotiate new contract terms, sometimes with effective dates that affect prior periods. While payments are typically made under the prior contract\u2019s terms, the amount of programming expenses recorded during the interim arrangement is based on our estimate of the ultimate contract terms expected to be negotiated. Differences between actual amounts determined upon resolution of negotiations and amounts recorded during these interim arrangements are recorded in the period of resolution.\nFilm and Television Costs\nCable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Sky produce owned content or acquire the rights to programming from third parties, which are described as film and television costs and programming rights, respectively.\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nFilm Costs:\nReleased, less amortization\n$\n1,551\n$\n1,600\nCompleted, not released\nIn production and in development\n1,314\n1,063\n3,052\n2,807\nTelevision Costs:\nReleased, less amortization\n2,810\n2,289\nIn production and in development\n1,162\n3,972\n3,242\nProgramming rights, less amortization\n5,786\n5,534\n12,810\n11,583\nLess: Current portion of programming rights\n3,877\n3,746\nFilm and television costs\n$\n8,933\n$\n7,837\nBased on our current estimates of the total remaining revenue from all sources (\u201cultimate revenue\u201d), in 2020 we expect to amortize approximately $1.9 billion of film and television costs associated with our original film and television productions that have been released, or are completed and have not been released. Through 2022, we expect to amortize approximately 88% of unamortized film and television costs for our released productions, excluding amounts allocated to acquired libraries.\nAs of December 31, 2019, acquired film and television libraries, which are included within the \u201creleased, less amortization\u201d captions in the table above, had remaining unamortized costs of $328 million. These costs are generally amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years, and approximately 47% of these costs are expected to be amortized through 2022.\nCapitalization of Film and Television Costs\nWe capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. We amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses. We generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Unamortized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\nIn determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset.\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of a film is less than its unamortized costs, we determine the fair value of the film and record an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the film\u2019s fair value. The estimated fair value of a production is based on level 3 inputs that primarily use an analysis of future expected cash flows. Adjustments to capitalized film production costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nWe may enter into cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. Cofinancing arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from a third-party investor under these arrangements as a reduction to our capitalized film costs. Under these arrangements, the investor owns an undivided copyright interest in the film, and therefore in each period we record either a charge or a benefit to programming and production expenses to reflect the estimate of the third-party investor\u2019s interest in the profit or loss of the film. The estimate of the third-party investor\u2019s interest in the profit or loss of a film is determined using the ratio of actual revenue earned to date to the ultimate revenue expected to be recognized over the film\u2019s useful life.\nWe capitalize the costs of programming rights for content that we license but do not own at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is made available for use. We amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast. We recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports programming rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. Advance payments for rights to multiyear, live-event sports programming are included in programming rights.\nProgramming costs are recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value on a program by program, package, channel or daypart basis. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Programming acquired by Cable Networks is primarily tested on a channel basis for impairment, whereas programming acquired by Broadcast Television is tested on a daypart basis. If we determine that the estimates of future cash flows are insufficient or if there is no plan to broadcast certain programming, we recognize an impairment charge to programming and production expenses.\nNote 5: Income Taxes\nIncome Before Income Taxes\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nDomestic\n$\n16,646\n$\n14,387\n$\n14,331\nForeign\n1,022\n$\n16,996\n$\n15,242\n$\n15,353\nComponents of Income Tax (Expense) Benefit\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nCurrent (Expense) Benefit:\nFederal\n$\n(2,085\n)\n$\n(2,026\n)\n$\n(2,411\n)\nState\n(425\n)\n(639\n)\n(277\n)\nForeign\n(600\n)\n(425\n)\n(389\n)\n(3,110\n)\n(3,090\n)\n(3,077\n)\nDeferred (Expense) Benefit:\nFederal\n(902\n)\n(546\n)\n10,651\nState\n(11\n)\nForeign\n(563\n)\n(290\n)\n10,646\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n$\n(3,673\n)\n$\n(3,380\n)\n$\n7,569\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nOur income tax (expense) benefit differs from the federal statutory amount because of the effect of the items detailed in the table below.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nFederal tax at statutory rate\n$\n(3,569\n)\n$\n(3,201\n)\n$\n(5,374\n)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n(306\n)\n(212\n)\n(299\n)\nForeign income taxed at different rates\n(126\n)\n(147\n)\n(70\n)\nNontaxable income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nAdjustments to uncertain and effectively settled tax positions, net\n(3\n)\n(144\n)\nAccrued interest and penalties on uncertain and effectively settled tax positions, net\n(29\n)\n(3\n)\nExcess tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation\nTax legislation\n12,682\nOther\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n$\n(3,673\n)\n$\n(3,380\n)\n$\n7,569\nWe base our provision for income taxes on our current period income, changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions, tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate and excess tax benefits or deficiencies that arise when the tax consequences of share-based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in the statement of income. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when there are temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and for the expected benefits of using net operating loss carryforwards. When a change in the tax rate or tax law has an impact on deferred taxes, we apply the change based on the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We record the change in our consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment.\nThe determination of the income tax consequences of a business combination includes identifying the tax basis of assets and liabilities acquired and any contingencies associated with uncertain tax positions assumed or resulting from the business combination. Deferred tax assets and liabilities related to temporary differences of an acquired entity are recorded as of the date of the business combination and are based on our estimate of the ultimate tax basis that will be accepted by the various tax authorities. We record liabilities for contingencies associated with prior tax returns filed by the acquired entity based on criteria set forth in the appropriate accounting guidance. We adjust the deferred tax accounts and the liabilities periodically to reflect any revised estimated tax basis and any estimated settlements with the various tax authorities. The effects of these adjustments are recorded to income tax (expense) benefit.\nFrom time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. In these cases, we evaluate our tax position using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions, including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions, certain financing transactions, and the allocation of income among state and local tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We classify interest and penalties, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax (expense) benefit.\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, new federal tax reform legislation was enacted in the United States, resulting in significant changes from previous tax law. The new legislation reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a $12.7 billion net income tax benefit to us for 2017, primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes at the new tax rate. Our federal income tax expense for periods beginning in 2018 is based on the new rate.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nComponents of Net Deferred Tax Liability\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nDeferred Tax Assets:\nNet operating loss and other loss carryforwards\n$\n2,017\n$\n1,926\nNondeductible accruals and other\n2,779\n2,656\nLess: Valuation allowance\n1,906\n2,890\n3,950\nDeferred Tax Liabilities:\nDifferences between book and tax basis of property and equipment and intangible assets\n29,387\n29,139\nDifferences between book and tax basis of investments\nDifferences between book and tax basis of long-term debt\nDifferences between book and tax basis of foreign subsidiaries and undistributed foreign earnings\n30,983\n30,319\nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n28,093\n$\n26,369\nChanges in our net deferred tax liability in 2019 that were not recorded as deferred income tax benefit (expense) are primarily related to an increase of $118 million associated with items included in other comprehensive income (loss) and an increase in net deferred tax liabilities of $1.0 billion as a result of the finalization of acquisition accounting for Sky. Our net deferred tax liability includes $15.4 billion related to cable franchise rights that will remain unchanged unless we recognize an impairment or dispose of a cable franchise or there is a change in the tax law.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $274 million, and various state net operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which expire in periods through 2039. As of December 31, 2019, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $5.6 billion related to the foreign operations of Sky and NBCUniversal, the majority of which can be carried forward indefinitely. The determination of the realization of the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on our subsidiaries\u2019 taxable income or loss, apportionment percentages, redetermination from taxing authorities, and state and foreign laws that can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforwards. We recognize a valuation allowance if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our valuation allowance was primarily related to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards. In 2019, in conjunction with the finalization of acquisition accounting for Sky, we recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately $1.2 billion associated with our assessment of the realization of Sky\u2019s deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating losses.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nOur liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 totaled $1.0 billion, which excludes the federal benefits on state tax positions that were recorded as deferred income taxes.\nReconciliation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\n(in millions)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, January 1\n$\n1,543\n$\n1,497\n$\n1,443\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\nAdditions based on tax positions related to prior years\nAdditions from acquired subsidiaries\n-\nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(344\n)\n(346\n)\n(251\n)\nReductions due to expiration of statutes of limitations\n(117\n)\n(75\n)\n(70\n)\nSettlements with tax authorities\n(24\n)\n(17\n)\n(65\n)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, December 31\n1,422\n1,543\n1,497\nPositions paid\n(409\n)\n(531\n)\n(688\n)\nLiability for uncertain tax positions\n$\n1,013\n$\n1,012\n$\nOur liability for uncertain tax positions represents the amounts recorded for potential payment obligations. Our gross unrecognized tax benefits also include amounts related to positions for which tax has been assessed and paid. If we were to recognize our gross unrecognized tax benefits in the future, $1.1 billion would impact our effective tax rate and the remaining amount would increase our deferred income tax liability. The amount and timing of the recognition of any such tax benefit is dependent on the completion of examinations of our tax filings by the various tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations. It is reasonably possible that certain tax contests could be resolved within the next 12 months that may result in a decrease in our effective tax rate.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our accrued interest associated with our liability for uncertain tax positions was $186 million and $203 million, respectively.\nThe IRS has completed its examination of our income tax returns for all years through 2016. Various states are examining our state tax returns and the tax years of those tax returns currently under examination vary by state, with most of the periods relating to tax years 2000 and forward. Various foreign jurisdictions are examining our tax returns and the tax years of those tax returns currently under examination vary by country, with most of the periods relating to tax years 2010 and forward.\nNote 6: Earnings Per Share\nComputation of Diluted EPS\nYear ended December 31\n(in millions, except per share data)\nNet Income\nAttributable\nto Comcast\nCorporation\nShares\nPer Share\nAmount\nNet Income\nAttributable\nto Comcast\nCorporation\nShares\nPer Share\nAmount\nNet Income\nAttributable\nto Comcast\nCorporation\nShares\nPer Share\nAmount\nBasic EPS attributable to\nComcast Corporation\nshareholders\n$\n13,057\n4,548\n$\n2.87\n$\n11,731\n4,584\n$\n2.56\n$\n22,735\n4,708\n$\n4.83\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nAssumed exercise or issuance\nof shares relating to stock\nplans\nDiluted EPS attributable to\nComcast Corporation\nshareholders\n$\n13,057\n4,610\n$\n2.83\n$\n11,731\n4,640\n$\n2.53\n$\n22,735\n4,786\n$\n4.75\nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders (\u201cdiluted EPS\u201d) considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method.

Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in which the combination of the option exercise price and the associated unrecognized compensation expense is greater than the average market price of our common stock. The amount of potential common shares related to our share-based compensation plans that were excluded from diluted EPS because their effect would have been antidilutive was not material in any of the periods presented.\nNote 7: Long-Term Debt\nLong-Term Debt Outstanding\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nWeighted-Average\nInterest Rate as of\nDecember 31, 2019\n2019(b)\n2018(b)\nCommercial paper\n-\n$\n-\n$\nRevolving credit facilities\n-\n-\nTerm loans\n1.87\n%\n8,078\n13,268\nSenior notes with maturities of 5 years or less, at face value\n3.29\n%\n26,378\n26,331\nSenior notes with maturities between 5 and 10 years, at face value\n3.74\n%\n21,683\n26,727\nSenior notes with maturities greater than 10 years, at face value\n4.54\n%\n46,653\n45,030\nOther, including capital lease obligations\n-\n1,098\nDebt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net(a)\n-\n(1,673\n)\n(1,702\n)\nTotal debt\n3.78\n%\n(a)\n102,217\n111,743\nLess: Current portion\n4,452\n4,398\nLong-term debt\n$\n97,765\n$\n107,345\n(a)\nIncludes the effects of our derivative financial instruments.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\n(b)\nAs of December 31, 2019, included in our outstanding debt were foreign currency denominated borrowings with principal amounts of \u00a34.9 billion, \u20ac4.9 billion, \u00a5267 billion and \u00a59 billion RMB. As of December 31, 2018, included in our outstanding debt were foreign currency denominated borrowings with principal amounts of \u00a37.3 billion, \u20ac4.9 billion, \u00a5390 billion and \u00a54 billion RMB.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our debt had an estimated fair value of $115.8 billion and $114.1 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nPrincipal Maturities of Debt\n(in millions)\n$\n4,455\n$\n9,125\n$\n5,581\n$\n7,664\n$\n6,759\nThereafter\n$\n70,306\nWe use cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. Cross-currency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency, which hedge currency exchange risks associated with foreign currency denominated cash flows such as interest and principal debt repayments. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges on $3.7 billion of our foreign currency denominated debt. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate estimated fair values of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges were a net asset of $373 million and $399 million, respectively.\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations. We have foreign currency denominated debt and use cross-currency swaps to hedge our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries. Transaction gains and losses resulting from currency movements on debt and changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are recorded within the currency translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).The aggregate amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries that have been hedged using cross-currency swaps and foreign currency denominated debt was $14.0 billion and $15.6 billion, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate estimated fair value of the cross-currency swaps was a net liability of $373 million and $587 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were pre-tax cumulative translation gains of $339 million and pre-tax cumulative translation losses of $4 million, respectively, related to these net investment hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nCommercial Paper Programs\nOur commercial paper programs provide a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $9.2 billion of revolving credit facilities due 2022 with a syndicate of banks that may be used for general corporate purposes. In June 2019, we amended the terms of our revolving credit facilities to extend their expiration dates from May 26, 2021 to May 26, 2022. We may increase the commitment under the revolving credit facilities up to a total of $12 billion, as well as extend the expiration dates to no later than 2023, subject to approval of the lenders. The interest rates on the revolving credit facilities consist of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcast\u2019s credit rating. As of December 31, 2019, the borrowing margin for borrowings based on the London Interbank Offered Rate was 1.00%. Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain certain financial ratios based on debt and EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit facilities. We were in compliance with all financial covenants for all periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2019, amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion. In 2019, we made net repayments of $615 million under Sky\u2019s \u00a31 billion revolving credit facility, which was terminated in February 2019.\nLetters of Credit and Bank Guarantees\nAs of December 31, 2019, we and certain of our subsidiaries had undrawn irrevocable standby letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling $484 million to cover potential fundings under various agreements.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nGuarantee Structure\nComcast, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal fully and unconditionally guarantee each other\u2019s debt securities, including the Comcast revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, the principal amount outstanding of debt securities within the cross-guarantee structure totaled $88.3 billion. Additionally, certain other subsidiary debt securities are guaranteed by Comcast and/or Comcast Cable as described below.\nComcast and Comcast Cable fully and unconditionally guarantee NBCUniversal Enterprise\u2019s debt securities, including its revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, the principal amount outstanding of NBCUniversal Enterprise\u2019s debt securities guaranteed by Comcast and Comcast Cable totaled $1.5 billion, all of which will mature within the next 3 years.\nComcast fully and unconditionally guarantees Universal Studios Japan\u2019s yen-denominated term loans. As of December 31, 2019, the principal amount outstanding of Universal Studio Japan\u2019s term loans guaranteed by Comcast totaled $2.5 billion (using exchange rates as of December 31, 2019), all of which will mature within the next 3 years.\nIn May 2019, Comcast provided a full and unconditional guarantee of Sky\u2019s debt securities in connection with Sky\u2019s noteholders consenting to (i) the transfer of the listing of three series of Sky notes from the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange to the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange and (ii) amending certain terms of the Sky notes. As of December 31, 2019, the principal amount outstanding of Sky\u2019s debt securities guaranteed by Comcast totaled $9.2 billion (using exchange rates as of December 31, 2019), of which $6.0 billion will mature within the next 5 years.\nNote 8: Significant Transactions\nSky Transaction\nOn October 9, 2018, in connection with our offer to acquire the share capital of Sky, we acquired a controlling interest in Sky through a series of purchases of Sky shares at our offer price of \u00a317.28 per Sky share. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining Sky shares and now own 100% of Sky\u2019s equity interests. Total cash consideration was \u00a330.2 billion (approximately $39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). We financed the acquisition through a combination of fixed and floating rate senior notes, the issuance of term loans and cash on hand.\nAllocation of Purchase Price\nWe have applied acquisition accounting to Sky. Sky\u2019s results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date and are reported in our Sky segment. The net assets of Sky were recorded at their estimated fair value using level 3 inputs. In valuing acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates are based on, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations and appropriate discount rates.\nIn 2019, we finalized the acquisition accounting in connection with the Sky transaction, which primarily resulted in decreases to intangible assets and investments (included below in other noncurrent assets and (liabilities), net), an increase to property and equipment, and corresponding adjustments to deferred taxes. We also recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately $1.2 billion associated with our assessment of the realization of Sky\u2019s deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating losses. These changes resulted in an increase in goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion and an adjustment recorded in 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that resulted in an increase to depreciation and amortization expense of $53 million.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nThe table below presents the allocation of the all-cash purchase price of \u00a330.2 billion, or $39.4 billion, to the assets and liabilities of Sky as a result of the transaction.\nAllocation of Purchase Price\n(in millions)\nConsideration transferred\n$\n39,387\nAllocation of purchase price\nCash\n$\n1,283\nAccounts receivable and other current assets\n2,359\nFilm and television costs (See Note 4)\n2,512\nProperty and equipment (See Note 11)\n4,127\nIntangible assets (See Note 12)\n19,539\nAccounts payable, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities\n(5,885\n)\nLong-term debt (See Note 7)\n(11,468\n)\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities), net (See Note 5)\n(2,974\n)\nOther noncurrent assets and (liabilities), net\n(1,398\n)\nFair value of identifiable net assets acquired\n8,095\nGoodwill (See Note 12)\n$\n31,292\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes customer premise equipment with a carrying value of $1.4 billion, which have original estimated useful lives of 5 to 7 years. The remaining property and equipment includes network assets, real estate and other machinery and equipment.\nIntangible Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships with a carrying amount of $9.5 billion and developed technology and software with a carrying amount of $4.3 billion, with original estimated useful lives between 6 and 19 years and 4 and 9 years, respectively. Indefinite-lived assets consist of trade names with a carrying amount of $5.8 billion.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists primarily of intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint, assembled workforce, noncontractual relationships and agreements. The acquired goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAs a result of the Sky transaction, we incurred expenses in 2018 related to legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services, which are reflected in other operating and administrative expenses. We also incurred certain financing costs associated with our borrowings, which are reflected in interest expense. The table below presents the amounts related to these expenses included in our consolidated statement of income. The amounts below do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or costs related to synergies that may be achieved as a result of the acquisition.\n(in millions)\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2018\nOther operating and administrative expenses\n$\nInterest expense\n$\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma information has been presented as if the Sky transaction occurred on January 1, 2017. This information is based on historical results of operations, adjusted for allocation of purchase price and other acquisition accounting adjustments, and is not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the business since January 1, 2017. For pro forma purposes, 2018 earnings were adjusted to exclude acquisition-related costs noted above, and 2017 earnings were adjusted to include these costs. No pro forma adjustments have been made for cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. The year ended December 31, 2019 is not presented as Sky is included in the consolidated results for the entire period.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nYear ended December 31 (in millions, except per share data)\nRevenue\n$\n109,518\n$\n102,971\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation\n$\n12,176\n$\n22,085\nBasic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$\n2.66\n$\n4.69\nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$\n2.62\n$\n4.61\nUniversal Beijing Resort\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (\u201cUniversal Beijing Resort\u201d). We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain financial and operating covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a526.6 billion RMB (approximately $3.8 billion). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2019, Universal Beijing Resort had $1.3 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a variable interest entity based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort\u2019s results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the \u201cconstruction of Universal Beijing Resort\u201d and \u201cproceeds from borrowings\u201d captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\nIn March 2018, Universal Beijing Resort received initial equity investments through a combination of cash and noncash contributions from the investors. As of December 31, 2019, our consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loan, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $3.0 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.\nFCC Spectrum Auction\nOn April 13, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission announced the results of its spectrum auction. In the auction, NBCUniversal relinquished its spectrum rights in the New York, Philadelphia and Chicago designated market areas (\u201cDMAs\u201d) where NBC and Telemundo had overlapping spectrum. NBCUniversal received proceeds of $482 million in July 2017, which were recorded in other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. NBCUniversal recognized a pretax gain of $337 million in other operating gains in 2017. NBC and Telemundo stations share broadcast signals in these DMAs. In connection with the auction, we also acquired the rights to $1.7 billion of spectrum in the second quarter of 2017, which were recorded to other intangible assets, net. We had previously made a deposit of $1.8 billion to participate in the auction in 2016 and received a refund for amounts in excess of the purchase price in 2017.\nUniversal Studios Japan\nOn April 6, 2017, we acquired the remaining interests in Universal Studios Japan that we did not already own for $2.3 billion. The acquisition was funded through cash on hand and borrowings under our commercial paper program. Because we maintained control of Universal Studios Japan, the difference between the consideration transferred and the recorded value of the noncontrolling interests, as well as the related tax and accumulated other comprehensive income impacts, were recorded to additional paid-in capital.\nNote 9: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The most significant change in the updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all operating leases with the exception of short-term leases. The standard also expands the disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease did not significantly change from previous guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted to reflect the impacts of the updated guidance. In addition, as permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, prior scoping and classification conclusions were carried forward for leases existing as of the adoption date.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nUpon adoption, we recorded $4.2 billion and $4.8 billion for operating lease assets and liabilities, respectively, which includes the impact of fair value adjustments, prepaid and deferred rent and lease incentives. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not significantly impact our recognition of finance leases, which were previously described as capital leases. As of the date of adoption, our liabilities for finance leases were $787 million, including $229 million of additional contracts determined to be leases in connection with the Sky transaction, which were recorded in long-term debt, and the related assets were recorded in property and equipment, net. Our finance leases were not considered material for further disclosure. The adoption of the new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 17 for further information.\nFilm and Television Costs\nIn March 2019, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The updated guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs and requires impairment testing to be performed at a group level for capitalized film and television costs when the content is predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content. We will adopt the updated accounting guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2020. Following adoption, we will present all film and television costs, including capitalized costs of acquired programming rights, as noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet. We do not expect the updated accounting guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.\nCredit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables and loans. The updated guidance requires the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of expected losses, replacing the incurred loss model in the prior guidance. We will adopt the updated accounting guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2020. We do not expect the updated accounting guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.\nNote 10: Investments\nInvestment and Other Income (Loss), Net\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nEquity in net income (losses) of investees, net\n$\n(505\n)\n$\n(364\n)\n$\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net\n(187\n)\n(17\n)\nOther income (loss), net\nInvestment and other income (loss), net\n$\n$\n(225\n)\n$\nInvestments\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nEquity method\n$\n5,347\n$\n4,035\nMarketable equity securities\nNonmarketable equity securities\n1,896\n1,805\nOther investments\n1,796\n1,796\nTotal investments\n9,392\n7,977\nLess: Current investments\n1,709\nLess: Investment securing collateralized obligation\n-\nNoncurrent investments\n$\n6,989\n$\n7,883\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nEquity Method\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee\u2019s operating and financial policies, or in which we hold a partnership or limited liability company interest in an entity with specific ownership accounts, unless we have virtually no influence over the investee\u2019s operating and financial policies. Equity method investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted to recognize (1) our share, based on percentage ownership or other contractual basis, of the investee\u2019s net income or loss after the date of investment, (2) amortization of the recorded investment that exceeds our share of the book value of the investee\u2019s net assets, (3) additional contributions made and dividends received, and (4) impairments resulting from other-than-temporary declines in fair value. For some investments, we record our share of the investee\u2019s net income or loss one quarter in arrears due to the timing of our receipt of such information. Gains or losses on the sale of equity method investments are recorded to other income (loss), net. If an equity method investee were to issue additional securities that would change our proportionate share of the entity, we would recognize the change, if any, as a gain or loss to other income (loss), net.\nAtairos\nOn January 1, 2016, we established Atairos Group, Inc., a strategic company focused on investing in and operating companies in a range of industries and business sectors, both domestically and internationally. Atairos has a term of up to 12 years and is controlled by management companies led by our former CFO through interests that carry all of the voting rights. We are the only investor other than our former CFO and the other management company employees. We have committed to fund Atairos up to $5 billion in the aggregate at any one time, subject to certain offsets, and $45 million annually for a management fee, subject to certain adjustments. The management company investors have committed to fund from $50 million to $100 million, with at least $40 million to be funded by our former CFO, subject to his continued role with Atairos. Our economic interests do not carry voting rights and obligate us to absorb approximately 99% of any losses and they provide us the right to receive approximately 86% of any residual returns in Atairos, in either case on a cumulative basis.\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairos as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2019 and 2018, we recognized losses of $64 million and $31 million, respectively; in 2017, we recognized income of $281 million. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we made cash capital contributions totaling $571 million, $282 million and $994 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment was $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.\nIn April 2018, we sold a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses to Atairos and received as consideration additional equity interests in Atairos. In connection with the sale of the businesses, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $200 million in other operating gains. In July 2017, we sold a business to a company owned by Atairos and received as consideration an investment in that company. In connection with the sale of the business, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $105 million in other operating gains.\nHulu and Collateralized Obligation\nIn May 2019, we entered into a series of agreements (the \u201cHulu Transaction\u201d) with The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries, whereby we relinquished our board seats and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. We also acquired our proportionate share of the approximate 10% interest in Hulu previously held by AT&T Inc. (\u201cAT&T\u201d) for approximately $477 million, increasing our ownership interest to approximately 33% from approximately 30%.\nFollowing the Hulu Transaction, future capital calls are limited to $1.5 billion in the aggregate each year, with any excess funding requirements funded with member loans. We have the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of these capital calls, and if we elect not to fund our share of future equity capital calls, our ownership interest will be diluted, subject to an ownership floor of 21%. The Hulu Transaction agreements include put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we can require Disney to buy, and Disney can require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. The minimum total equity value and ownership floor guarantee minimum proceeds of approximately $5.8 billion upon exercise of the put or call.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nIn connection with the Hulu Transaction, we agreed to extend certain licenses of NBCUniversal content until late 2024. We can terminate most of our content license agreements with Hulu beginning in 2022, and beginning in 2020, we have the right to modify certain content licenses that are currently exclusive to Hulu, so that we can exhibit the content on our platforms in return for reducing the license fee.\nIn August 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024. The principal amount of the term loan is secured by the proceeds guaranteed by Disney under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. The proceeds from the put/call provisions are available only for the repayment of the term loan and are not available to us unless and until the bank lenders are fully paid under the term loan provisions. The bank lenders have no rights to proceeds from the put/call provisions in excess of amounts owed under the term loan. As a result of this transaction, we now present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our consolidated balance sheet in the captions \u201cinvestment securing collateralized obligation\u201d and \u201ccollateralized obligation\u201d, respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. As of December 31, 2019, our collateralized obligation had a carrying value of $5.2 billion and an estimated fair value of $5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nWe account for our investment using the equity method. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recognized losses of $473 million, $454 million and $276 million, respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we made cash capital contributions totaling $903 million, inclusive of the funding for the acquisition of the AT&T interest, $454 million and $300 million, respectively, to Hulu. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment was $694 million and $248 million, respectively.\nIn August 2016, Time Warner Inc., which was acquired by AT&T in 2018, acquired a 10% interest in Hulu, diluting our interest at that time from approximately 33% to approximately 30%. Given the contingent nature of put and call options related to that interest, we recorded a deferred gain as a result of the dilution. In the first quarter of 2019, the put and call options expired unexercised and we recognized the previously deferred gain of $159 million in other income (loss), net.\nMarketable Equity Securities\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. The changes in fair value between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\nSnap\nIn March 2017, we acquired an interest in Snap Inc. for $500 million as part of its initial public offering, which was classified as a marketable equity security and was sold in 2019. We recognized gains of $293 million and losses of $268 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, our investment was $162 million.\nPeloton\nIn 2019, we recognized unrealized gains of $184 million, which included unrealized gains as a result of Peloton\u2019s initial public offering in September 2019. Following the initial public offering, we now present our investment in marketable equity securities, which was previously presented in non-marketable equity securities. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment was $294 million and $110 million, respectively.\nNonmarketable Equity Securities\nWe classify investments without readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as nonmarketable equity securities. The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We apply this measurement alternative to a majority of our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities based on level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nOther Investments\nAirTouch\nWe hold two series of preferred stock of Verizon Americas, Inc., formerly known as AirTouch Communications, Inc. (\u201cAirTouch\u201d), a subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc., which are redeemable in April 2020. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment in AirTouch was $1.6 billion, and was included in other current assets and investments, respectively. We account for our investment in AirTouch as a held to maturity investment using the cost method. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the estimated fair value of the AirTouch preferred stock was $1.7 billion.\nThe dividend and redemption activity of the AirTouch preferred stock determines the dividend and redemption payments associated with substantially all of the preferred shares issued by one of our consolidated subsidiaries, which is a VIE. The subsidiary has three series of preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate redemption value of $1.75 billion. Substantially all of the AirTouch preferred stock is redeemable in April 2020 at a redemption value of $1.65 billion. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the two series of redeemable subsidiary preferred shares were recorded at $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and were included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the liability related to the redeemable subsidiary preferred shares had an aggregate estimated fair value of $1.7 billion. The estimated fair values of the AirTouch preferred stock and redeemable subsidiary preferred shares are based on level 2 inputs that use pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. The one series of nonredeemable subsidiary preferred shares was recorded at $100 million as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, and those amounts are included in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheet. The carrying amount of the nonredeemable subsidiary preferred shares approximates its fair value.\nImpairment Testing of Investments\nWe review our investment portfolio, other than our marketable equity securities, each reporting period to determine whether there are identified events or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments and held to maturity investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments and our held to maturity investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\nNote 11: Property and Equipment\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nWeighted-Average\nOriginal Useful Life\nas of December 31, 2019\nDistribution systems\n11 years\n$\n40,639\n$\n38,380\nCustomer premise equipment\n6 years\n26,065\n26,208\nOther equipment\n9 years\n13,025\n12,437\nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n30 years\n15,104\n14,188\nConstruction in process\nN/A\n5,245\n2,991\nLand\nN/A\n1,483\n1,539\nProperty and equipment, at cost\n101,561\n95,743\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n53,239\n51,306\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n48,322\n$\n44,437\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. We capitalize improvements that extend asset lives and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred. We record depreciation using the straight-line method over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation and, unless the gain or loss on disposition is presented separately, we recognize it as a component of depreciation expense. Capital expenditures for acquisitions and construction of real estate properties and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance related to cable television companies, Cable Communications capitalizes the costs associated with the construction of and improvements to our cable transmission and distribution facilities, including scalable infrastructure and line extensions; costs associated with acquiring and deploying new customer premise equipment; and costs\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nassociated with installation of our services. Costs capitalized include all direct costs for labor and materials, as well as various indirect costs. Costs incurred in connection with subsequent disconnects and reconnects are expensed as they are incurred.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of depreciation expense.\nCertain of our cable franchise agreements and lease agreements contain provisions requiring us to restore facilities or remove property in the event that the franchise or lease agreement is not renewed. We expect to continually renew our cable franchise agreements and therefore cannot reasonably estimate liabilities associated with such agreements. A remote possibility exists that franchise agreements could be terminated unexpectedly, which could result in us incurring significant expense in complying with restoration or removal provisions. We do not have any material liabilities related to asset retirement obligations recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 12: Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nNBCUniversal\n(in millions)\nCable\nCommunications\nCable\nNetworks\nBroadcast\nTelevision\nFilmed\nEntertainment\nTheme\nParks\nSky\nCorporate\nand Other\nTotal\nBalance, December 31, 2017\n$\n12,784\n$\n13,427\n$\n$\n3,212\n$\n6,544\n$\n-\n$\n$\n36,780\nAcquisitions(a)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n29,889\n-\n29,925\nDispositions\n-\n-\n-\n(8\n)\n-\n-\n(5\n)\n(13\n)\nAdjustments\n-\n(13\n)\n(9\n)\n-\n-\n-\n(21\n)\nForeign currency translation\n-\n(7\n)\n-\n(11\n)\n(639\n)\n-\n(517\n)\nBalance, December 31, 2018\n12,784\n13,407\n3,184\n6,684\n29,250\n66,154\nAcquisitions\n-\n-\n-\nDispositions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(12\n)\n-\n(12\n)\nAdjustments(b)\n2,166\n-\n(1,616\n)\n1,379\nForeign currency translation\n(1\n)\n-\nBalance, December 31, 2019\n$\n15,074\n$\n14,067\n$\n1,059\n$\n3,321\n$\n6,739\n$\n28,461\n$\n$\n68,725\n(a)\nAcquisitions in 2018 primarily included the Sky acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, the goodwill resulting from the Sky acquisition was presented in the Sky segment. See Note 8 for further information on the Sky acquisition.\n(b)\nAdjustments in 2019 primarily included 1) measurement period adjustments resulting from finalization of acquisition accounting for Sky and 2) the final assignment of goodwill resulting from the Sky transaction to our reporting units.\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from anticipated synergies and intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint, assembled workforce, noncontractual relationships and other agreements. We assess the recoverability of our goodwill annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. As a result of this assessment, our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense. We did not recognize any impairment charges in any of the periods presented.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nIntangible Assets\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nWeighted-Average\nOriginal Useful Life\nas of December 31, 2019\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets:\nFranchise rights\nN/A\n$\n59,365\n$\n59,365\nTrade names\nN/A\n8,809\n9,633\nFCC licenses\nN/A\n2,337\n2,333\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets:\nCustomer relationships\n14 years\n22,884\n$\n(8,295\n)\n25,046\n$\n(6,682\n)\nSoftware\n5 years\n15,357\n(7,287\n)\n11,395\n(5,990\n)\nOther agreements and rights\n23 years\n3,958\n(1,635\n)\n4,145\n(1,522\n)\nTotal\n$\n112,710\n$\n(17,217\n)\n$\n111,917\n$\n(14,194\n)\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of our cable franchise rights. Our cable franchise rights represent the values we attributed to agreements with state and local authorities that allow access to homes and businesses in cable service areas acquired in business combinations. We do not amortize our cable franchise rights because we have determined that they meet the definition of indefinite-lived intangible assets since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. We reassess this determination periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur.\nWe assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Our three Cable Communications divisions represent the unit of account we use to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information. If the fair value of our cable franchise rights or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense. We did not recognize any material impairment charges in any of the periods presented.\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nEstimated Amortization Expense of Finite-Lived Intangible Assets\n(in millions)\n$\n4,113\n$\n3,649\n$\n3,090\n$\n2,589\n$\n2,184\nFinite-lived intangible assets are subject to amortization and consist primarily of customer relationships acquired in business combinations, software and intellectual property rights. Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or the term of the associated agreement.\nWe capitalize direct development costs associated with internal-use software, including external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees devoting time to these software projects. We also capitalize costs associated with the purchase of software licenses. We generally amortize them on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed five years. We expense maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of a project, as they are incurred. We capitalize initial operating system software costs and amortize them over the life of the associated hardware.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.\nNote 13: Employee Benefit Plans\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nBenefit obligation\n$\n3,273\n$\n2,885\n$\n2,539\nInterest expense\n$\n$\n$\nWe maintain unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plans for certain members of management and nonemployee directors. The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participant accounts are credited with income primarily based on a fixed annual rate. Participants are eligible to receive distributions from their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.\nWe have purchased life insurance policies to recover a portion of the future payments related to our deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the cash surrender value of these policies, which is recorded to other noncurrent assets, was $423 million and $351 million, respectively.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor several 401(k) defined contribution retirement plans that allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation through payroll deductions in accordance with specified plan guidelines. We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees\u2019 contributions up to certain limits. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, expenses related to these plans totaled $573 million, $546 million and $458 million, respectively.\nWe sponsor a retiree health and welfare benefit plan that provides postretirement benefits to eligible employees. The plan provides, to eligible employees who retire from Comcast or its subsidiaries, an annual stipend for reimbursement of certain eligible healthcare costs. The amount of the stipend for an eligible retiree is fixed at a predetermined amount based on the retiree\u2019s years of service and whether the retiree is eligible for Medicare. NBCUniversal sponsors various nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for domestic employees. The future benefits for these plans have been frozen since the beginning of 2013. In addition to the defined benefit plans it sponsors, NBCUniversal is also obligated to reimburse The General Electric Company (\u201cGE\u201d) for future benefit payments to those participants who were vested in the supplemental pension plan sponsored by GE at the time of the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. These plans are all unfunded and not material.\nWe participate in various multiemployer benefit plans, including pension and postretirement benefit plans, that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We also participate in other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare and retirement savings benefits to active and retired participants. If we cease to be obligated to make contributions or were to otherwise withdraw from participation in any of these plans, applicable law would require us to fund our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits, which is known as a withdrawal liability. In addition, actions taken by other participating employers may lead to adverse changes in the financial condition of one of these plans, which could result in an increase in our withdrawal liability. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the total contributions we made to multiemployer benefit plans were not material.\nSeverance Benefits\nWe provide severance benefits to certain former employees. A liability is recorded when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded severance costs of $359 million, $243 million and $203 million, respectively.\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nNote 14: Equity\nCommon Stock\nIn the aggregate, holders of our Class A common stock have 662/3% of the voting power of our common stock and holders of our Class B common stock have 331/3% of the voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Each share of our Class B common stock is entitled to 15 votes. The number of votes held by each share of our Class A common stock depends on the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding at any given time. The 331/3% aggregate voting power of our Class B common stock cannot be diluted by additional issuances of any other class of common stock. Our Class B common stock is convertible, share for share, into Class A common stock, subject to certain restrictions.\nShares of Common Stock Outstanding\n(in millions)\nClass A\nClass B\nBalance, December 31, 2016\n4,742\nStock compensation plans\n-\nRepurchases and retirements of common stock\n(131\n)\n-\nEmployee stock purchase plans\n-\nBalance, December 31, 2017\n4,635\nStock compensation plans\n-\nRepurchases and retirements of common stock\n(140\n)\n-\nEmployee stock purchase plans\n-\nBalance, December 31, 2018\n4,517\nStock compensation plans\n-\nRepurchases and retirements of common stock\n-\n-\nEmployee stock purchase plans\n-\nBalance, December 31, 2019\n4,544\nShare Repurchases\nEffective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $12 billion, which does not have an expiration date.

Awards generally vest over a period of 5 years and in the case of stock options, have a 10 year term. Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. As of December 31, 2019, all of our stock options outstanding were net settled stock options. Net settled stock options, as opposed to stock options exercised with a cash payment, result in fewer shares being issued and no cash proceeds being received by us when the options are exercised.\nStock Options and Restricted Share Units\nAs of December 31, 2019, unless otherwise stated (in millions, except per share data)\nStock\nOptions\nRSUs\nAwards granted during 2019\nWeighted-average exercise price of awards granted during 2019\n$\n40.50\nStock options outstanding and nonvested RSUs\nWeighted-average exercise price of stock options outstanding\n$\n31.84\nWeighted-average fair value at grant date of nonvested RSUs\n$\n36.54\nThe cost associated with our share-based compensation is based on an award\u2019s estimated fair value at the date of grant and is recognized over the period in which any related services are provided.

Some of NBCUniversal\u2019s employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, and others, as well as some of its on-air and creative talent, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. As of December 31, 2019, the total number of NBCUniversal employees covered by collective bargaining agreements was 9,400 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately, 12% of these full-time equivalent employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements that have expired or are scheduled to expire during 2020.\nWe, through Comcast Spectacor, have employment agreements with both players and coaches of the Philadelphia Flyers. Certain of these employment agreements, which provide for payments that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination, are covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met.\nThe table below summarizes our minimum annual programming and talent commitments.

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nexercise that option. We generally utilize our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The lease asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are not recorded for leases with an initial term of one year or less. Lease expense for operating leases recorded in the balance sheet is included in operating costs and expenses and is based on the future minimum lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease plus any variable lease costs. Operating lease expenses, inclusive of short-term and variable lease expenses, recognized in our consolidated statement of income for the period ended December 31, 2019 was $1.1 billion. This amount does not include lease costs associated with production activities or other amounts capitalized in our consolidated balance sheet, which are not material.\nThe table below summarizes the operating lease assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n(in millions)\nDecember 31,\nOther noncurrent assets, net\n$\n4,038\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n$\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n$\n3,891\nThe table below summarizes our future minimum lease commitments for operating leases as of December 31, 2019 applying the new guidance.\n(in millions)\nDecember 31,\n$\nThereafter\n2,243\nTotal future minimum lease payments\n5,626\nLess: imputed interest\n1,020\nTotal liability\n$\n4,606\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases and the weighted average discount rate used to calculate our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were 10 years and 3.74%, respectively.\nIn 2019, cash payments for operating leases recorded in the consolidated balance sheet were $914 million.

The arrangement provides the counterparty with the right to periodic payments associated with current period revenue which are\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nrecorded as an operating expense, and beginning in June 2017, the option to require NBCUniversal to purchase the interest for cash in an amount based on a contractual formula. The contractual formula is based on an average of specified historical theme park revenue at the time of exercise, which amount could be significantly higher than our carrying value. As of December 31, 2019, our carrying value was $1.1 billion, and the estimated value of the contractual obligation was $1.8 billion based on inputs to the contractual formula as of that date.\nRedeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock\nNBCUniversal Enterprise is a holding company that we control and consolidate whose principal assets are its interests in NBCUniversal Holdings. The holders of the Series A cumulative preferred stock of NBCUniversal Enterprise have the right to cause NBCUniversal Enterprise to redeem their shares at a price equal to the $725 million aggregate liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends for a 30 day period beginning on March 19, 2020 and thereafter on every third anniversary of such date (each such date, a \u201cput date\u201d). The NBCUniversal Enterprise preferred stock pays dividends at a fixed rate of 5.25% per year. Shares of preferred stock can be called for redemption by NBCUniversal Enterprise at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends one year following the put date applicable to such shares. Because certain of these redemption provisions are outside of our control, the NBCUniversal Enterprise preferred stock is presented outside of equity under the caption \u201credeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock\u201d in our consolidated balance sheet. Its initial value was based on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock and is adjusted for accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of the NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock was $749 million and $741 million, respectively. The estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs that use pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation.\nNote 18: Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\n(in millions, except per share data)\nFirst\nQuarter\nSecond\nQuarter\nThird\nQuarter\nFourth\nQuarter\nTotal\nYear\nRevenue\n$\n26,859\n$\n26,858\n$\n26,827\n$\n28,398\n$\n108,942\nOperating income\n$\n5,182\n$\n5,356\n$\n5,340\n$\n5,247\n$\n21,125\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation\n$\n3,553\n$\n3,125\n$\n3,217\n$\n3,162\n$\n13,057\nBasic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$\n0.78\n$\n0.69\n$\n0.71\n$\n0.69\n$\n2.87\nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$\n0.77\n$\n0.68\n$\n0.70\n$\n0.68\n$\n2.83\nDividends declared per common share\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.84\n2018(a)\nRevenue\n$\n22,791\n$\n21,735\n$\n22,135\n$\n27,846\n$\n94,507\nOperating income\n$\n4,645\n$\n5,014\n$\n4,836\n$\n4,514\n$\n19,009\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation\n$\n3,118\n$\n3,216\n$\n2,886\n$\n2,511\n$\n11,731\nBasic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.70\n$\n0.63\n$\n0.55\n$\n2.56\nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$\n0.66\n$\n0.69\n$\n0.62\n$\n0.55\n$\n2.53\nDividends declared per common share\n$\n0.19\n$\n0.19\n$\n0.19\n$\n0.19\n$\n0.76\nMinor differences may exist due to rounding.\n(a)\nThe 2018 amounts include the operations of Sky from October 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018.

Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets\n\u2022\nprovide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors\n\u2022\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nComcast 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTreadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that NBCUniversal\u2019s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nThere were no changes in NBCUniversal\u2019s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NBCUniversal\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.",

Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and are de minimis. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing during the year ended December 31, 2019 that requires disclosure under the Act, except with respect to the following:\n\u2022\nPrior to our August 2016 acquisition of DreamWorks Animation, a non-U.S. subsidiary of DreamWorks Animation entered into a licensing agreement in January 2016 that licensed a prior season of a children\u2019s animated television series for a three-year, non-cancelable term and for a one-time fee of $5,200 to a broadcasting company that is owned and controlled by the Government of Iran. The broadcasting company paid the license fee in the first quarter of 2016. We believe that DreamWorks Animation conducted its licensing activity in compliance with applicable laws and that the license is for the permissible exportation of informational materials pursuant to certain statutory and regulatory exemptions from U.S. sanctions.\n\u2022\nPrior to our fourth quarter 2018 acquisition of Sky, a non-U.S. subsidiary of Sky entered into two licensing agreements that licensed some of Sky\u2019s owned programming content to a broadcasting company that is owned and controlled by the Government of Iran. The first agreement was entered into in June 2012, and was amended in July 2016, to license 150 hours of programming content for various three-year license terms for a one-time fee of \u20ac86,250. The last remaining programming license under this agreement expires in January 2019. The second agreement was entered into in June 2015 to license 80 hours of programming content for various three-year license terms for a one-time fee of \u20ac45,700. To date, no programming content has been provided, and the license fee has not been paid, pursuant to the agreement.
