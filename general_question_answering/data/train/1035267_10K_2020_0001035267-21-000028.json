BUSINESS\nIn this report, \u201cIntuitive Surgical,\u201d \u201cIntuitive,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries.

The Company is focused on innovating to enable physicians and healthcare providers to improve the quality of and access to minimally invasive care. Our mission reflects that we believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. Intuitive brings more than two decades of leadership in robotic-assisted surgical technology and solutions to its offerings. While surgery and acute interventions have improved significantly in the past decades, there remains a significant need for better outcomes and decreased variability of these outcomes across care teams. The current healthcare environment continues to stress critical resources, including the professionals who staff care teams: surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, and other staff. At the same time, governments strain to cover the healthcare needs of their populations and demand lower total cost per patient to treat disease. In the face of these challenges, we believe scientific, process, and technological advances in biology, computing, imaging, algorithms, and robotics offer new methods to solve continued and difficult problems.\nWe address these needs by focusing on the quadruple aim. First, we focus on products and services that can improve outcomes and decrease variability in the hands of care teams. Second, we seek to improve the patient experience by minimizing disruption to lives and creating greater predictability for the treatment experience. Third, we seek to improve care team satisfaction by creating products and services that are dependable, smart, and optimized for the care environment in which they are used. Finally, we seek to lower the total cost to treat per patient episode when compared with existing treatment alternatives, providing a return on investment for hospitals and healthcare systems and value for payers.\nBy striving to find less invasive ways to enter the body, provide clearer views of anatomy and more precise tissue interactions, and helping hone surgical skills, Intuitive launched its first da Vinci Surgical System in 1999. In 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) cleared da Vinci for general laparoscopic surgery.\nThe da Vinci Surgical System is designed to enable complex surgery using a minimally invasive approach. It consists of an ergonomic surgeon console or consoles, a patient-side cart with an interactive arm or arms, a high-performance vision system, and proprietary instruments and accessories. Surgeons using the da Vinci system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a three-dimensional, high definition (\u201c3DHD\u201d) image of the surgical field. This immersive visualization connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. While seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to the open surgery approach. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremors inherent in a surgeon\u2019s hands. In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use.\nOur da Vinci Surgical Systems provide the following features and benefits to surgeons:\nImmersive 3DHD Visualization. Our vision system includes a 3DHD endoscope with two independent vision channels linked to two separate color monitors through sophisticated image processing electronics. The da Vinci Surgical System provides visualization of the target anatomy with natural depth-of-field and magnification that is intended to facilitate accurate tissue identification and tissue layer differentiation. With our Firefly Fluorescence Imaging technology, surgeons can use our specialized imaging hardware in combination with an injectable fluorescent dye to visualize vasculature, tissue perfusion, or biliary ducts beneath tissue surfaces in real-time.\nPrecise and Tremor-Free Endoscope Control. Our imaging system also incorporates our proprietary camera control technology that allows the surgeon to easily change, move, zoom, and rotate his or her field of vision. Surgeons can reposition the surgical camera quickly with foot controls or zoom in, out, up, down, left, or right by moving their hands while maintaining a stable image.\nAdvanced Instruments. We offer a comprehensive suite of stapling, energy, and core instrumentation for our surgical systems. Most of our proprietary instruments feature EndoWrist technology, incorporating \u201cwrist\u201d joints. Inspired by the human hand, our wristed instruments enable surgeons to orient the instruments carefully relative to the tissue and suture with precision, just as they can in open surgery.\nIntuitive Instrument Movements. Our technology is designed to transform the surgeon\u2019s natural hand movements outside of the body into corresponding micro-movements inside the patient\u2019s body. For example, with the da Vinci Surgical System, a hand movement to the right outside of the body causes the instrument inside the patient to be moved to the right. In contrast, conventional minimally invasive surgery (\u201cMIS\u201d) instruments are long, rigid levers that rotate around a fulcrum, or pivot point, located at the port created in the body wall. In conventional MIS, the instrument tip moves in the opposite direction from the surgeon\u2019s hand, and surgeons must adjust their hand-eye coordination to compensate for the direction reversal by the pivot.\nScaled, Tremor Filtered Instrument Movement. With our technology, a surgeon can also use \u201cmotion scaling,\u201d a feature that translates, for example, a three-millimeter hand movement outside the patient\u2019s body into a one-millimeter instrument movement in the surgical field inside the patient\u2019s body. Motion scaling is designed to allow precision and control for delicate tasks. In addition, our technology filters the tremor inherent in a surgeon\u2019s hands.\nImproved Surgeon Ergonomics. The da Vinci Surgical System is designed to allow surgeons to operate while seated, which may be clinically advantageous because of reduced surgeon fatigue. The da Vinci Surgical System\u2019s design provides natural hand-eye alignment at the surgeon\u2019s console. Because the da Vinci Surgical System\u2019s robotic arms hold the camera and instruments steady, there is less surgeon and assistant fatigue.\nMulti-Specialty Surgical Platform. The da Vinci Surgical System is designed to enable surgeons to perform a wide range of surgical procedures within our targeted gynecologic, urologic, general surgery, cardiothoracic, and head and neck specialties. To date, surgeons have used the da Vinci Surgical System to perform dozens of different types of surgical procedures. While we do not expect all of these different types of procedures to become widely adopted, they demonstrate the flexibility of the da Vinci Surgical System.\nAdvanced Training Tools. Training technologies include our Simulation program, which provides for independent da Vinci skills development through interactive Virtual Reality (\u201cVR\u201d) exercises, and our telementoring program, which provides real-time, surgeon-to-surgeon learning and collaboration during robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System.\nAdditionally, the FDA cleared Iris, Intuitive\u2019s augmented reality imaging product, for use in kidney procedures. Iris extracts CT scans, runs them through machine-learning algorithms, and returns a segmented model of the kidney for use in planning for a procedure and for intraoperative visualization of the area. The tool uses augmented reality to give surgeons an image with details of the kidney anatomy - blood vessels, tumor shape, and size - that they may not be able to see well with other imaging. Intuitive designed Iris, among other things, to be shared as a teaching tool among surgeons to coordinate approaches to complex cases. It can also be part of the viewing experience during a procedure to enhance information and let surgeons know where critical anatomy sits as they work through a procedure.\nIn 2019, the FDA cleared our Ion endoluminal system, which enables minimally invasive biopsies in the lung. Our Ion system is a flexible, robotic-assisted, catheter-based platform that utilizes instruments and accessories, which extends our commercial offering beyond surgery into diagnostic, endoluminal procedures with this first application. Many suspicious lesions found in the lung may be small and difficult to access, which can make diagnosis challenging, and Ion helps physicians obtain tissue samples from deep within the lung, which could help enable earlier diagnosis.\nProducts\nda Vinci Surgical Systems\nIntuitive\u2019s primary platform for robotic-assisted surgery is our family of da Vinci Surgical Systems. We have commercialized four generational platforms of da Vinci Surgical Systems: our fourth generation da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci SP Surgical Systems, our third generation da Vinci Si Surgical System, our second generation da Vinci S Surgical System, and our first generation da Vinci standard Surgical System. Da Vinci Surgical Systems are comprised of the following components:\nSurgeon\u2019s Console. The da Vinci Surgical System allows surgeons to operate while comfortably seated at an ergonomic console viewing a 3DHD image of the surgical field. The surgeon\u2019s fingers grasp instrument controls below the display with the surgeon\u2019s hands naturally positioned relative to his or her eyes. Using electronic hardware, software, algorithms, and mechanics, our technology translates the surgeon\u2019s hand movements into precise and corresponding real-time micro movements of the da Vinci instruments positioned inside the patient. On most of our current systems (da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci Si), a second surgeon\u2019s console may be used in two ways: to provide assistance to the primary surgeon during surgery or to act as an active aid during surgeon-proctor training sessions. With the da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci Si, a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da Vinci instruments during the surgery. In addition, surgeons can control 3D virtual pointers to augment the dual-surgeon experience.\nPatient-Side Cart. The patient-side cart holds electromechanical arms that manipulate the instruments inside the patient. Up to four arms attached to the cart can be positioned, as appropriate, and then locked into place. At least two arms hold surgical instruments, one representing the surgeon\u2019s left hand and one representing the surgeon\u2019s right hand. A third arm positions the endoscope, allowing the surgeon to easily move, zoom, and rotate the field of vision. A fourth instrument arm extends surgical capabilities by enabling the surgeon to add a third instrument to perform additional tasks. The fourth instrument arm is a standard, integrated feature on the da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci Si Surgical Systems. Our da Vinci SP Surgical System includes a single arm with three, multi-jointed, wristed instruments and the first da Vinci fully wristed, 3DHD camera. The instruments and the camera all emerge through a single cannula and are triangulated around the target anatomy to avoid external instrument collisions that can occur in narrow surgical workspaces.\n3DHD Vision System. Our vision system includes our InSite 3D endoscope with two separate vision channels linked to two separate color monitors through high performance video cameras and specialized image processing hardware. The resulting 3DHD image has high resolution, high contrast, low flicker, and low cross fading. A digital zoom feature in the 3DHD vision system allows surgeons to magnify the surgical field of view without adjusting the endoscope position and, thereby, reduces interference between the endoscope and instruments. The 3DHD vision system is a standard, integrated feature on the da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, da Vinci SP, da Vinci Si, and da Vinci S Surgical Systems.\nSkills Simulator. The Skills Simulator is a practice tool that gives a user the opportunity to practice their skills and gain familiarity with the surgeon console controls. The Skills Simulator incorporates 3D, physics-based computer simulation technology to immerse the user within a virtual environment and provides training capabilities that have been used extensively by surgeons. The user navigates through the environment and completes exercises by controlling virtual instruments from the surgeon console. Upon completion of a skills exercise, the Skills Simulator provides a quantitative assessment of user performance based on a variety of task-specific metrics. The Skills Simulator is intended to augment, not replace, existing training programs for the da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci SP Surgical Systems.\nDa Vinci Xi Integrated Table Motion. Integrated Table Motion coordinates the movements of the da Vinci robotic arms with an advanced operating room table, the TS 7000dV OR Table sold by HillromTM, to enable managing the patient\u2019s position in real-time while the da Vinci robotic arms remain docked. This gives operating room teams the capability to optimally position the operating table during da Vinci Surgical System procedures. Integrated Table Motion enables surgeons to maximize reach, facilitate access, and choose the angle of approach to target anatomy, as well as reposition the table during the procedure to enhance anesthesiologists\u2019 management of the patient.\nFirefly Fluorescence Imaging. Firefly is a standard feature of the da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi Surgical Systems and is available on our da Vinci Si Surgical System. This imaging capability combines a fluorescent dye with a specialized da Vinci camera head, endoscope, and laser-based illuminator to allow surgeons to identify vasculature, tissue perfusion, or biliary ducts in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces to visualize critical anatomy. Firefly is typically used in the procedure categories of urology, gynecology, and general surgery.\nInformatics\nIntuitive Cloud. The vast majority of our systems are connected to the Intuitive cloud to enable proactive monitoring and provide software updates.\nSimNow. Our cloud-enabled SimNow simulation platform is our latest generation simulator, which allows surgeons to learn and practice their surgical skills. SimNow is compatible with multiple da Vinci platforms and can be connected to the internet. The SimNow online connection drives real-time simulation performance tracking for surgeons and administrators through an online dashboard and supports remote updates of the VR content and 3DHD videos to drive a more interactive and engaging customer experience.\nIris. In February 2019, the FDA cleared Iris, Intuitive\u2019s augmented reality imaging product, for use in kidney procedures. Iris extracts CT scans, runs them through machine-learning algorithms, and returns a segmented model of the kidney for use in planning for a procedure and for intraoperative visualization of the area. The tool uses augmented reality to give surgeons an image with details of the kidney anatomy - blood vessels, tumor shape, and size - that they may not be able to see well with other imaging. Intuitive designed Iris to be shared as a teaching tool among surgeons to coordinate approaches to complex cases, for example. It can also be part of the viewing experience during a procedure to enhance information and let surgeons know where critical anatomy sits as they work through a procedure. We are currently only using Iris in pilot studies. We launched our first pilot site in the U.S. in December 2019 and have five pilot sites as of December 31, 2020.\nInstruments and Accessories\nDa Vinci Instruments. We manufacture a variety of instruments, most of which incorporate EndoWrist technology with wristed joints for natural dexterity and tips customized for various surgical procedures. Da Vinci instruments are offered in a variety of diameters, of which 8mm and 12mm diameter sizes are the most commonly sold. Various da Vinci instrument tips include forceps, scissors, electrocautery tools, scalpels, and other surgical tools that are familiar to the surgeon from open surgery and conventional MIS. A variety of instruments may be selected and used interchangeably during a surgery. Most instruments are sterilizable at the hospital, while others are provided sterile, and most are reusable for a defined number of procedures. A programmed memory chip inside each instrument performs several functions that help determine how the da Vinci system and instruments work together. In addition, the chip will generally not allow the instrument to be used for more than the prescribed number of procedures to help ensure that its performance meets specifications during each procedure.\nIn 2020, we introduced our \"Extended Use Program,\" which consists of select da Vinci Xi and da Vinci X instruments possessing 12 to 18 uses (\"Extended Use Instruments\") compared to the prior 10 use instruments. These Extended Use Instruments represent some of our higher volume instruments but exclude stapling, monopolar, and advanced energy instruments. Instruments included in the program are used across a number of da Vinci procedures. Their increased uses are the result of continuous, significant investments in the design and production capabilities of our instruments, resulting in improved quality and durability. We introduced Extended Use Instruments in the U.S. in October 2020 and in Europe in November 2020. We expect to introduce Extended Use Instruments in other geographies throughout 2021 and 2022, depending on the timing of regulatory approvals.\nDa Vinci Stapling. The EndoWrist Stapler is a wristed, stapling instrument intended for resection, transection, and/or creation of anastomoses. This instrument enables operators to precisely position and fire the stapler. We market four staplers available with the da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi Surgical Systems: the EndoWrist Stapler 30 and 45 and the SureForm 45 and 60, where the numeric designation indicates the length of the staple line. The EndoWrist Stapler 30 is intended to deliver particular utility with fine tissue interaction in lobectomy and other thoracic procedures. The EndoWrist Stapler 45 is used in general surgery, gynecologic, thoracic, and urologic procedures. The SureForm 45 is intended to deliver particular utility in thoracic procedures. The SureForm 60 is a single-use, fully wristed, stapling instrument intended to deliver particular utility in bariatric procedures. We market five stapler reloads: gray (2.0 mm), white (2.5 mm), blue (3.5 mm), green (4.3 mm), and black (4.6 mm). Not all reloads are available for use on all staplers. Not all staplers or reloads are available in all countries.\nDa Vinci Energy. The EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer is a wristed, single-use instrument intended for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to 7mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument. This instrument enables surgeons to fully control vessel sealing, while providing the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery. This instrument is designed to enhance surgical efficiency and autonomy in a variety of general surgery and gynecologic procedures. The da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend is our newest instrument in the Vessel Sealing family of products. The da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend is a single-use, fully wristed bipolar electrosurgical instrument compatible with our fourth generation multiport systems. It is intended for grasping and blunt dissection of tissue and for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to 7mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument.\nThe E-100 generator is Intuitive's first generator and is offered as an upgrade to power the da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend and SynchroSeal. SynchroSeal will enable a surgeon to perform rapid, one-step sealing and transection with a single pedal press. SynchroSeal uses advanced bipolar energy from its raised cut electrode to transect tissue and then cool down quickly.\nAccessory Products. We sell various accessory products, which are used in conjunction with the da Vinci Surgical Systems as surgical procedures are performed. Accessory products include sterile drapes used to help ensure a sterile field during surgery, vision products, such as replacement 3D stereo endoscopes, camera heads, and light guides, and other items that facilitate use of the da Vinci Surgical Systems.\nIon endoluminal system\nOur Ion endoluminal system extends our commercial offerings beyond surgery into diagnostic procedures with its first application. The Ion system is our flexible, robotic-assisted, catheter-based platform designed to navigate through very small lung airways to reach peripheral nodules for biopsies. The Ion system uses an ultra-thin articulating robotic catheter that can articulate 180 degrees in all directions. The outer diameter of the catheter is 3.5mm, which allows physicians to navigate through small and tortuous airways to reach nodules in most airway segments within the lung. The Ion system\u2019s flexible biopsy needle can also pass through very tight bends via Ion\u2019s catheter to collect tissue in the peripheral lung. The catheter\u2019s 2mm working channel can also accommodate other biopsy tools, such as biopsy forceps or cytology brushes, if necessary.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur goal aligns with the Quadruple Aim: enabling physicians and hospitals to improve outcomes for their patients, improve their patient\u2019s and the care team\u2019s experience, and lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. Through the use of smart, connected systems, robotic technologies, advanced imaging, and informatics, our objective is to create value for patients, surgeons, and hospitals as summarized below:\nPatient Value. We believe that the value of a surgical procedure to a patient can be defined: Patient Value = Procedure Efficacy / Invasiveness. We define procedure efficacy as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. When the patient value of a da Vinci procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options, patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons and hospitals that offer that da Vinci surgery, which could potentially result in a local market share shift. Adoption of da Vinci procedures occurs procedure by procedure and market by market and is driven by the relative patient value and the total treatment costs of da Vinci procedures as compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state or condition. We believe that most patients will place higher value on procedures that are not only more efficacious but also less invasive than alternative treatments. Our goal is to provide products to surgeons who, in turn, provide patients with procedure options that are both highly effective and less invasive than other surgical options.\nSurgeon Value. We offer surgeons and their operating room staff training on the technical use of our products. We provide an ergonomic platform for surgeons to perform their procedures. We seek to provide surgeons with reliable and easy-to-use products. The change to cloud-based analytics and routine use of local analytics may help surgeons track their procedures and processes and, with a network-connected smartphone and the MyIntuitive app, surgeons can access and explore their procedure data, such as console time and instrument usage, to gain insights into their program.\nHospital Value. We assist hospitals in building value by offering patient value using da Vinci products, thereby increasing surgical revenue and reducing costs through lower complication rates and reduced lengths of patient stay. We believe robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci Surgical System is a cost effective approach to many surgeries as compared to alternative treatment options, as recognized in many published studies. We also offer our Custom Hospital Analytics program, which enables the integration of data sources so that individual health institutions can analyze their data in their own environment. Using this data, administrators, chiefs of surgery, and surgeons can gain alignment around their programs based on their KPIs, determine best practices, assess gaps, and take actionable steps to address any gaps.\nClinical Applications\nWe are the beneficiaries of productive collaborations with leading surgeons in exploring and developing new techniques and applications for robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci Surgical System and minimally invasive biopsies with the Ion endoluminal system-an important part of our creative process. We primarily focus our development efforts on those procedures in which we believe our products bring the highest patient value, surgeon value, and hospital value. We currently focus on five surgical specialties: gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, general surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. Key procedures that we are focused on include da Vinci hysterectomy (\u201cdVH\u201d), da Vinci prostatectomy (\u201cdVP\u201d), da Vinci for hernia repair, da Vinci for colon and rectal procedures, da Vinci for partial nephrectomy, da Vinci for sacrocolpopexy, da Vinci for lobectomy, da Vinci for transoral robotic surgery, and da Vinci for bariatric surgery. We also focus on minimally invasive biopsies in the lung. Representative surgical applications are described below.\nGynecologic Surgery\nHysterectomy. Removal of the uterus is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in gynecology and is performed for a variety of underlying benign and cancerous conditions. Hysterectomies can be performed using open surgery (laparotomy) or MIS techniques, which include vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted approaches. Prior to the clearance of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in gynecological procedures in 2005, the majority of hysterectomies performed were open surgeries. We believe that robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci Surgical System provides patients the opportunity to receive a minimally invasive treatment as an alternative to an open hysterectomy.\nSacrocolpopexy. The abdominal (open) sacrocolpopexy is one of the operations performed to treat vaginal vault prolapse. Sacrocolpopexy involves suturing a synthetic mesh that connects and supports the vagina to the sacrum (tailbone). A sacrocolpopexy can be performed using a conventional laparoscopic technique; however, it is generally described as difficult and cumbersome to perform. Surgeons have reported that the da Vinci Surgical System\u2019s capabilities may enable a larger number of these procedures to be performed through a minimally invasive technique, conferring the benefits of MIS to a broader range of sacrocolpopexy patients.\nUrologic Surgery\nProstatectomy. Radical prostatectomy is the removal of the prostate gland in patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer. The standard approach to removal of the prostate was via an open surgical procedure. The conventional laparoscopic approach is an option, but it is difficult and poses challenges to even the most skilled urologist. The da Vinci Surgical System has enabled a large number of surgeons to convert from using an open surgical technique to a minimally invasive technique.\nPartial Nephrectomy. Partial nephrectomy is the removal of a small portion of a kidney (typically, an area of the kidney containing a tumor). Partial nephrectomies are most commonly performed in patients diagnosed with clinically localized renal cancer. Excluding robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System, there are three common surgical approaches to performing partial nephrectomies: open surgical technique, laparoscopy, and hand-assisted laparoscopy, which is a hybrid of the open and laparoscopic techniques. Surgeons have reported that the da Vinci Surgical System\u2019s capabilities may enable a large number of these procedures to be performed through a minimally invasive technique, conferring the benefits of MIS to a broader range of partial nephrectomy patients. Treatment guidelines for patients with localized renal cancer recommend partial nephrectomy due to the benefits that nephron-sparing surgery has in long-term patient outcomes. Published clinical literature has shown that the presence of a da Vinci Surgical System is associated with a higher-proportion of patients receiving a guideline-recommended partial nephrectomy.\nGeneral Surgery\nHernia Repair. A hernia occurs when an organ or other tissue squeezes through a weak spot in a surrounding muscle or connective tissue. During a hernia repair surgery, the weakened tissue is secured, and defects are repaired. Common types of hernia are ventral and inguinal. Ventral, or abdominal hernia, may occur through a scar after surgery in the abdomen. Inguinal hernia is a bulge in the groin and is more common in men. Hernia repair can be performed using traditional open surgery or MIS. There is a wide-range of complexity in hernia repair surgeries and varying surgeon opinion regarding optimal surgical approach. The benefits of minimally invasive and robotic-assisted hernia repair surgery vary by patient.\nColorectal Surgery. These procedures typically involve benign or cancerous conditions of the lower digestive system, in particular the rectum or colon. Common procedures in this area include hemicolectomy, sigmoidectomy, low anterior resection, and abdominoperineal resection. Surgeons have reported that the use of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System and our latest technologies, such as the EndoWrist Stapler and da Vinci Energy, have enabled them to offer MIS approaches to a broader range of colorectal surgery patients.\nCholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy, or the surgical removal of the gall bladder, is a commonly performed general surgery procedure. Cholecystectomy is the primary method for the treatment of gallstones and other gall bladder diseases. Most cholecystectomies are performed using multi-port MIS techniques, although some surgeons choose to perform cholecystectomy using manual single-port instrumentation. Firefly technology can be used to visualize biliary anatomy in three dimensions beneath the tissue surfaces during multi-port da Vinci cholecystectomies.\nBariatric Surgery. A body of literature points to the benefit of surgery to treat patients for morbid obesity and its secondary effects, such as diabetes. Sleeve gastrectomy and roux-en-Y gastric bypass (\u201cRYGB\u201d) are commonly performed surgical procedures for morbid obesity in the U.S. The body habitus of morbidly obese patients can make laparoscopic surgery physically challenging for the surgeon, and certain surgeons have found value in using the da Vinci Surgical System to improve upon the ergonomics when performing MIS in morbidly obese patients. In addition, RYGB can be a technically challenging procedure due to the suturing, stapling, and tissue (bowel) manipulation that is required. Surgeons using the da Vinci Surgical System have reported a reduction in a critical complication (anastomotic leaks) relative to laparoscopic RYGB. Also, we believe SureForm 60 may have particular utility in bariatric procedures.\nCardiothoracic Surgery\nThoracic Surgery. Conventional approaches to surgical procedures in the thorax include both open and video-assisted thoracoscopic approaches. Procedures performed via these methods include pulmonary wedge resection, pulmonary lobectomy, thymectomy, mediastinal mass excision, and esophagectomy. Many thoracic procedures remain open procedures. Surgeons have reported that the use of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System in thoracic surgery has enabled them to offer MIS approaches to a broader range of thoracic surgery patients and improved clinical outcomes compared to open and video-assisted thoracic surgery in published single-center, multi-center, and national database clinical studies. Also, we believe the EndoWrist Stapler 30 may have particular utility in thoracic procedures.\nMitral Valve Repair. When patients are diagnosed with mitral valve disease, there are typically two surgical treatment options from which they can choose: mitral valve replacement or mitral valve repair. Mitral valve repairs are generally preferred over mitral valve replacement for a number of reasons, which include longevity and durability of the repaired valve over a replacement valve and the elimination or reduction of the patient\u2019s post-surgical pharmaceutical regimen.\nSeveral of our surgeon customers have reported an improvement in their mitral valve repair rates over mitral valve replacements when using the da Vinci Surgical System.\nHead and Neck Surgery\nTransoral Surgery. Head and neck cancers are typically treated by either surgical resection or chemo-radiation, or a combination of both. Surgical resection performed by an open approach may require a \u201cjaw-splitting\u201d mandibulotomy. This procedure, while effective in treating cancer, is potentially traumatic and disfiguring to the patient. MIS approaches via the mouth (transoral surgery) are challenged by line-of-sight limitations dictated by conventional endoscopic tools. Chemo-radiation as a primary therapy does allow patients to avoid traumatic surgical incisions; however, literature suggests that this modality diminishes patients\u2019 ability to speak and swallow normally. Surgeons have reported that da Vinci transoral surgery allows them to operate on tumors occurring in the oropharynx (i.e., tonsil and base of tongue) and larynx via the mouth and to overcome some of the line-of-sight limitations of conventional transoral surgery.\nDa Vinci Procedure Mix\nOur da Vinci procedure business is broadly split into two categories: (1) cancer procedures and (2) procedures for benign conditions. Cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions. Thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex, benign conditions. Our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions across the spectrum of procedure complexity. Our fully featured da Vinci Xi Surgical System with advanced instruments, including the da Vinci Energy and EndoWrist and SureForm Stapler products, and our Integrated Table Motion product, targets the more complex procedure segment. Our da Vinci X Surgical System is targeted towards price sensitive markets and procedures. Our da Vinci SP Surgical System complements the da Vinci Xi and X Surgical Systems by enabling surgeons to access narrow workspaces.\nClinical Summary\nWe believe that there are numerous additional applications that can be addressed with the da Vinci Surgical System, and we work closely with our surgeon customers to refine and explore new techniques in which a da Vinci Surgical System may bring value. As of December 31, 2020, we had an installed base of 5,989 da Vinci Surgical Systems, including 3,720 in the U.S., 1,059 in Europe, 894 in Asia, and 316 in the rest of the world. We estimate that surgeons using our technology completed approximately 1,243,000 surgical procedures of various types in hospitals throughout the world during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, we believe that there are numerous additional applications that can be addressed with the Ion endoluminal system. As of December 31, 2020, we had an installed base of 36 Ion endoluminal systems, all of which are located in the U.S.\nSales and Customer Support\nSales Model\nWe provide our products through direct sales organizations in the U.S., Europe (excluding Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and most Eastern European countries), China, Japan, South Korea, India, and Taiwan. In January 2019, our Intuitive-Fosun joint venture (referred to herein as the \u201cJoint Venture\u201d) with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (\u201cFosun Pharma\u201d) acquired certain assets related to the distribution business of Chindex Medical Limited and its affiliates (\u201cChindex\u201d), a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma, which has been our distribution partner for da Vinci Surgical Systems in China since 2011, and began direct operations for da Vinci products and services in China. See \u201cItem 7. Management Discussion and Analysis\u201d for further details on the Joint Venture. In the remainder of our markets outside of the U.S. (\u201cOUS\u201d), we provide our products through distributors. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, domestic revenue accounted for 68%, 70%, and 71%, respectively, of total revenue, while revenue from our OUS markets accounted for 32%, 30%, and 29%, respectively, of total revenue. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, 83% and 85% of all long-lived assets were in the U.S., respectively.\nOur direct sales organization is composed of a capital sales team, responsible for selling systems, and a clinical sales team, responsible for supporting system use in procedures performed at our hospital accounts. Our hospital accounts include both individual hospitals and healthcare facilities as well as hospitals and healthcare facilities that are part of an integrated delivery network (\u201cIDN groups\u201d). The initial system sale into an account is a major capital equipment purchase by our customers and typically has a lengthy sales cycle that can be affected by macroeconomic factors, capital spending prioritization, timing of budgeting cycles, and competitive bidding processes. Capital sales activities include educating surgeons or physicians and hospital staff across multiple specialties on the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, total treatment costs, and the clinical applications that our technology enables. We also train our sales organization to educate hospital management on the potential benefits of adopting our technology, including the clinical benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, potential reductions in complications and length of stay, and the resulting potential for increased patient satisfaction, surgeon or physician recruitment, and procedure volume.\nOur clinical sales team works on site at hospitals, interacting with surgeons or physicians, operating room staff, and hospital administrators to develop and sustain successful robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy programs. They assist the hospital in identifying surgeons or physicians who have an interest in robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy and the potential benefits provided by the da Vinci Surgical System and the Ion endoluminal system. Our clinical sales team provides current clinical information on robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy practices and new product applications to the hospital teams. Our clinical sales team has grown with the expanded installed bases of da Vinci Surgical Systems and Ion endoluminal systems as well as the total number of procedures performed. We expect this organization to continue to grow as our business expands.\nOur customers place orders to replenish their supplies of instruments and accessories on a regular basis. Orders received are typically shipped within one business day. New direct customers who purchase a new system typically place an initial stocking order of instruments and accessories soon after they receive their system.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset. In addition, we have historically experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third quarters and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth quarters. More than half of da Vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions. These benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer procedures and surgeries for other life-threatening conditions. In the U.S., volumes for procedures associated with benign conditions are typically seasonally higher in the fourth quarter when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower in the first quarter when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside the U.S. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods. The timing of procedures and changes in procedure volume impact the timing of instrument and accessory and capital purchases. As a result of factors outlined in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-COVID-19 Pandemic\" below, including the past and potential future recommendations of authorities to defer elective procedures, historical procedure patterns have been and may continue to be disrupted.\nCustomer Support and Training Programs\nWe have a network of field service engineers across the U.S., Europe, and Asia and maintain relationships with various distributors around the globe. This infrastructure of service and support specialists offers a full complement of services for our customers, including 24/7 support, installation, repair, and maintenance. We generate service revenue by providing these services to our customers through comprehensive service contracts and time and material programs.\nWe provide basic system training that teaches the fundamental operating principles of the systems to surgeons, surgical assistants, and operating room nurses. We have established training centers where system training and ongoing surgical procedural training are provided, the latter led by expert surgeons. Training technologies include our Simulation program, which provides independent da Vinci skills development through interactive VR exercises, and our telementoring program, which provides real-time surgeon-to-surgeon learning and collaboration during robotic-assisted surgery.\nResearch and Development\nWe focus our research and development efforts on innovation and improvement for products and services that align with our mission: We believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. Through ingenuity and intelligent technology, we believe that we can expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We employ engineering and research and development staff to focus on delivering future innovations and sustaining improvements that advance our mission. In certain instances, we complement our research and development effort through collaborations with other companies, such as Trumpf Medical (a division of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.).\nManufacturing\nWe manufacture our systems at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Durham, North Carolina. We manufacture our instruments at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Mexicali, Mexico. We also have manufacturing at multiple sites in Germany.\nWe purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods relative to our anticipated demand.\nCompetition\nWe face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and emerging interventional surgical approaches. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality and reliability, as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the demonstrated results associated with robotic-assisted surgery using da Vinci Surgical Systems and its value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that have introduced or are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that the entrance or emergence of competition validates MIS and robotic-assisted surgery.\nMoreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g., da Vinci Stapling and da Vinci Energy) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well established companies, such as Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Medtronic plc.\nThe companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field, include, but are not limited to: avateramedical GmbH; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson (including their wholly owned subsidiaries Auris Health, Inc. and Verb Surgical Inc.); Medicaroid, Inc.; Medrobotics Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; MicroPort Scientific Corporation; Olympus Corporation; Samsung Group; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; Smart Robot Technology Group Co. Ltd.; Titan Medical Inc.; and TransEnterix, Inc. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics in surgery are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products.\nIntellectual Property\nWe place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes.\nWe generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own robust patent portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held ownership or exclusive field-of-use licenses for more than 4,000 U.S. and foreign patents and have filed more than 2,000 U.S. and foreign patent applications. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology.\nPatents are granted for finite terms. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products and operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, the State of California, and countries or regions in which we market our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards, which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance to such standards. Examples of standards to which we are subject include electrical safety standards, such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g., IEC 60601-ss series of standards), and composition standards, such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (\u201cRoHS\u201d) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) Directives.\nU.S. Regulation\nThe FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to markets outside of the U.S. and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad.\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFFDCA\u201d), medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II, or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class II medical devices.\nClass II medical devices are those which are subject to general controls, and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification\nprocess. Unless a Class II medical device is exempt from a premarket review, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d in intended use and technology to a \u201cpredicate device\u201d that is either:\n\u2022a device that has grandfather marketing status, because it was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or\n\u2022a device that has previously been cleared through the 510(k) process.\nIf the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission, or a guidance-based 30-day period for \u201cspecial\u201d 510(k) submissions, which have a more restrictive scope and generally involve more specific or very limited changes to a legally marketed device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d the FDA may deny the request for clearance. Although unlikely for the types of products marketed by us, the FDA may classify the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pre-market approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) requirements. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that a device is safe and effective, must be supported by data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, although the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.\nAfter a device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA application in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer\u2019s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.\nOver the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals will include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period and make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on these proposals. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.\nMore recently, in September 2019, the FDA finalized guidance describing an optional \u201csafety and performance based\u201d premarket review pathway for manufacturers of \u201ccertain, well-understood device types\u201d to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list of device types appropriate for the \u201csafety and performance based\u201d pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.\nIn addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These requirements include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA, compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur, and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims, and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make\nunsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the U.S. have similar regulations to which we are subject.\nOur manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201cGMP\u201d) requirements contained in its Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d) and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records, which demonstrate compliance with the FDA regulation, the manufacturer\u2019s own procedures, specifications, and testing, as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company\u2019s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Form FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations, which list instances where the FDA investigator believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, or Untitled Letters, which are notices of potential enforcement actions against the manufacturer. If a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter is not addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA or if the FDA becomes aware of any other serious issue with a manufacturer\u2019s products or facilities, it could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, total shutdown of production facilities, prohibition on export or import, and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the U.S. and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product.\nTo a greater or lesser extent, most other countries require some form of quality system and regulatory compliance, which may include periodic inspections, inspections by third-party auditors, and specialized documentation. Failure to meet all of the requirements of these countries could jeopardize our ability to import, market, support, and receive reimbursement for the use of our products in these countries.\nIn addition to the above, we may seek to conduct clinical studies or trials in the U.S. or other countries on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for a particular indication. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation, and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d). Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the Company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, secure reimbursement, or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot provide assurance that access to clinical investigators, sites, subjects, documentation, and data will be available on the terms and in the timeframes necessary.\nProducts manufactured outside the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products with U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays.\nCalifornia Regulation\nThe State of California requires that we obtain a license to manufacture medical devices and, until 2012, conducted periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. Our facilities and manufacturing processes were last inspected in July 2011 and were found to be in compliance. In accordance with the State of California regulations, our license to manufacture is renewed annually with any updated manufacturing information. Although the State of California has announced the suspension of routine periodic inspections, there can be no assurance that the State of California will not resume such inspections or conduct such inspections under specific circumstances that are not yet known.\nForeign Regulation\nIn order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes that are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and meet all of the local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines.\nFor example, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval to be sold in Japan. We obtained approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and\nWelfare (\u201cMHLW\u201d) for our da Vinci Si Surgical System in October 2012, for our da Vinci Xi Surgical System in March 2015, and for our da Vinci X Surgical System in April 2018. National reimbursement status in Japan was received for dVP procedures in April 2012 and for da Vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in April 2016. An additional 12 da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. An additional 7 procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2020. These additional 19 reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these 19 procedures, there can be no assurance that adoption will occur or that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to any other da Vinci procedures. If these procedures are not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursements for additional procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited. The process of reimbursement for new da Vinci surgical procedures in Japan is led by the surgical societies. The societies submit for reimbursement or incremental reimbursement to the MHLW for their evaluation. The decision to reimburse requires in-country clinical data and is fixed in April of even-numbered years.\nCommercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (\u201cCE\u201d) mark for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance mandated in applicable European medical device directives, which, once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated countries that accept the CE mark. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside of the EU, such as Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to affix the CE mark on products, a recognized European Notified Body must certify a manufacturer\u2019s quality system and design dossier for compliance with international and European requirements. We have received authorization from Presafe Denmark A/S (formerly DGM Denmark A/S), a recognized European Notified Body and part of Nemko Presafe A/S, to affix the CE mark to our da Vinci Surgical Systems and EndoWrist instruments and accessories. To maintain authorization to apply the CE mark, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. In September 2013, the European Commission adopted a recommendation indicating that all Notified Bodies, including Presafe, should carry out unannounced audits at least once every third year, of the manufacturers whose medical devices they have certified. These unannounced audits can also extend to the manufacturer\u2019s critical suppliers or sub-contractors (those that supply a critical input or perform a critical function for the manufacturer).\nIf we modify our existing products or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain authorization to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or whether we will continue to meet the safety and performance standards required to maintain the authorizations we have already received. If we are unable to maintain authorizations to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the EU or those whose marketing authorizations are based on the CE mark.\nIn May 2017, the Medical Device Regulation was implemented to replace the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The Medical Device Regulation ((EU) 2017/745) comes into force on May 26, 2021, and imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and grants Notified Bodies increased post-market surveillance authority. We may be subject to risks associated with additional testing, modification, certification, or amendment of our existing market authorizations, or we may be required to modify products already installed at our customers\u2019 facilities to comply with the official interpretations of these revised regulations.\nRegulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as China and South Korea, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and provincial approvals, as well as hospitals completing a tender process under the authorization. In October 2018, the China National Health Commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in China through 2020. After an adjustment notice was published in the third quarter of 2020, the government will now allow for the total sale of 225 new surgical robots into China, which could include da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. Sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems under the quota are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals. In addition, local regulations may apply, which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and, in general, are increasing in complexity, and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use, and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices in the regions in which we operate and\nmarket our products. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could prevent us from marketing our products in these regions.\nOther Healthcare Laws\nWe are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency, privacy, and security laws and regulations. These laws include:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022federal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act \u201cqui tam\u201d actions on behalf of the government, and such individuals may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement;\n\u2022the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires (i) manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (as described below), and teaching hospitals, and (ii) applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership any investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to such physician owners. Additionally, on October 25, 2018, President Trump signed into law the \u201cSubstance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promoted Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act,\u201d which, in part (under a provision entitled \u201cFighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine\u201d), extends the reporting and transparency requirements for physicians in the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021). Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year; and\n\u2022analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, and laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, including the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from our participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nThird-Party Coverage and Reimbursement\nIn the U.S. and most markets OUS where we sell our products, the government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and surgeon reimbursement for virtually all covered surgical procedures. Governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for surgery when the procedure is considered medically necessary. In the U.S., CMS administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable state governments). Many other third-party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the Medicare program. As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors\u2019 payment systems.\nGenerally, reimbursement for professional services performed at a facility by physicians is reported under billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (\u201cAMA\u201d), known as Current Procedural Terminology (\u201cCPT\u201d) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative value of the professional service rendered. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (\u201cNCHS\u201d) are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures, ICD-10-PCS codes. For Medicare, CMS generally reimburses hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay based on a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Medicare-Severity Diagnostic Related Groupings (\u201cMS-DRGs\u201d). MS-DRGs are assigned using a number of factors, including the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharged status, patient age, and complicating secondary diagnoses, among other things. Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (\u201cAPCs\u201d) used to determine the payment amount for services provided.\nSince October 1, 2015, a new family of ICD-10-PCS codes can be used, in conjunction with other applicable procedure codes, to describe various robotic-assisted procedures. An inpatient surgical procedure, completed with or without robotic assistance, continues to be assigned to the clinically relevant MS-DRG.\nGovernments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure performed, the third-party payor, contract terms, and other factors. Because both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services, with or without robotics, regardless of actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care, including for the specific products used in that procedure, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products.\nDomestic institutions typically bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs and private insurance plans for the primary surgical procedure that includes our products. Because our da Vinci Surgical Systems have been cleared for commercial distribution in the U.S. by the FDA, coverage and reimbursement by payors are generally determined by the medical necessity of the primary surgical procedure. Governmental and third-party payors may also consider additional factors when determining coverage and reimbursement, including the designation of the surgical procedure as a covered benefit, the appropriateness of the procedure for the specific patient, support by guidelines established by the relevant professional college or medical society, and a payor determination that the procedure is neither experimental nor investigational. We believe that the additional procedures we intend to pursue are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable by government agencies and insurance companies for appropriately selected patients. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if governmental and private payors\u2019 policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.\nIn countries outside the U.S., reimbursement is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. In most foreign countries, private insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies. In addition, health maintenance organizations are emerging in certain European countries. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such \u201cco-pay\u201d practices are not common in most countries.\nIn the U.S., there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cPPACA\u201d), was enacted. The PPACA made changes that have significantly impacted healthcare providers,\ninsurers, and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. The PPACA contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion, including, but not limited to, fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers.\nThe PPACA also appropriated funding to research the comparative effectiveness of healthcare treatments and strategies. It remains unclear how this research will influence future Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions as well as influence other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies. The PPACA, as well as other federal or state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The taxes imposed by PPACA and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits, lower reimbursement from payors for procedures that use our products, and/or reduced procedural volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension of the 2% cut in Medicare payments from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019 and are based on various performance measures and physicians\u2019 participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.\nThere have also been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as efforts by the U.S. administration to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. The Trump administration has also announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction (\u201cCSR\u201d) payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for the CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the PPACA. Legislation to appropriate funds for CSR payments has been introduced in Congress, but the future of such legislation is uncertain. In addition, CMS finalized regulations that, effective beginning with the 2020 plan year, give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017, the PPACA\u2019s individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance coverage was eliminated starting in 2019. Further, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the PPACA. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA and, therefore, because it was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Fifth Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but it remanded the case back to the district court for further analysis of whether the mandate could be severed from the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on March 2, 2020 and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. The case is expected to be decided by mid-2021. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent pending appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Although the majority of these measures have not been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may continue to consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the PPACA. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nHuman Capital\nThe future success of our company depends on our ability to attract, retain, and further develop top talent. To facilitate talent attraction, retention, and development, we strive to make Intuitive an inclusive, diverse, and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs as well as by programs that build connections between our employees and the communities in which they live and work.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had approximately 8,081 full-time employees, 1,111 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 3,559 in manufacturing and service, and 3,411 in marketing, sales and administrative activities. During 2020, the number of employees increased by approximately 755. Our employees are based in 27 different countries around the world. Our global workforce consists of diverse, highly skilled talent at all levels. During 2020, our turnover rate was less than 6.5%.\nInclusion and Diversity\nWe strive to foster a culture where mutual respect, inclusive behavior, and dignity are core to our individual expectations. Since our founding, we have remained committed to fostering an inclusive environment in which our differing backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives join to positively impact the communities in which we live and serve.\nWe continue to build a culture where the best idea wins and our doors and minds are always open. We do this by leading with inclusion and empowering everyone to do their best work as their most authentic selves-regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, disability, or military service status. We are united by our collective purpose and common set of organizational values that are core to our mission and culture.\nWe support the growth and expansion of our employee resource groups (ERGs), which foster an inclusive culture and sense of belonging for our employees. Our ERGs provide a point of connection for employees who share common community attributes and want to engage, learn, communicate, and participate in advancing our inclusion and diversity objectives. Our ERGs include the Women Intuitive Network, Intuitive Pan-Asian Community, BLACK at Intuitive, Diverse Abilities, PRIDE, and VETS. In 2020, our ERGs grew from three to 10 companywide. These employee-volunteer-led groups focus on four key impact areas including recruitment, employee development, community building, and business development. ERGs also provided ideas and insight to senior management and various departments by serving as sources of employee feedback on important aspects of our business, such as talent acquisition and retention, accessibility accommodations, and operational challenge solutions.\nFrom a governance perspective, maintaining a mix of backgrounds and experience in our board composition is essential to understanding and reflecting the needs of our diverse stakeholders. Currently, three of our 10 board members are women, one of our board members identifies as Hispanic, and one of our board members identifies as Middle Eastern.\nHealth, Safety, and Wellness\nThe health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested, and will continue to do so. These investments and the prioritization of employee health, safety, and wellness took on particular significance in 2020 in light of COVID-19. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being. Additionally, we provide programs to help support employee physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status, encourage engagement in healthy behaviors, and offer choices where possible so they are customized to meet their needs and the needs of their families.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. A number of employees critical to maintaining our essential engineering, manufacturing, repair, and logistics functions have continued to work from Intuitive locations globally. To protect and support our essential team members, we have implemented health and safety measures that included maximizing personal workspaces, changing shift schedules, providing personal protective equipment (PPE), and instituting mandatory screening before accessing buildings. We created subteam groups, keeping the same manufacturing teams working together to facilitate contact tracing and minimize potential staffing risk.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base compensation, these programs, which vary by country and region, include annual bonuses, stock awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 401(k) and pension plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, and flexible work schedules, among many others. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented modifications to our compensation program, including paying a portion of 2020 bonuses mid-year to help staff cover unforeseen pandemic-related expenses. We also offered premium pay and a subsidized lunch program.\nEnsuring fair and equitable pay is integral to our commitment to our employees. Our executive team and Board of Directors strongly support this commitment. We conduct pay equity reviews annually to help us understand whether our compensation structure is appropriate and to identify what improvements can be made. In addition, we utilize a robust inspection process with an independent consulting firm for gender and ethnicity hiring, promotion, and wage equity to determine whether any statistically significant pay differences exist between women and men and between minorities and non-minorities. If pay disparities are identified, we conduct further evaluation to determine whether remedial adjustments are appropriate. In addition, employees can raise issues regarding pay equity with their manager, their human resources partner, or confidentially through our anonymous reporting helpline.\nTalent Development\nWe value our employees and the passion, commitment, and professional depth they provide. To enhance employee retention and job satisfaction, we offer ongoing learning and leadership training opportunities that support growth.\nWith a commitment to achieving diverse representation within our leadership ranks that reflects the diversity that we see in our overall employee base, we increased our leadership development efforts in 2020 by reinforcing development around our People Leader Success Model. Leadership development focuses on people-leader effectiveness, cultural continuity, and organizational effectiveness, so that leaders at all levels have the capabilities and knowledge that they and their teams need to succeed.\nOur Global Talent Management team transitioned much of our leadership training from in-person sessions to remote learning with the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020. Our scaled learning platform of on-demand and virtual classroom learning eliminates travel and allows employees worldwide to access development at their convenience.\nWe have robust annual global performance review processes for reviewing all employees\u2019 performance and pay. To support our managers, we train them on conducting effective performance reviews and making compensation recommendations, which take into consideration market pay data and performance, as well as experience in an employee\u2019s respective role.\nCommunity Programs and Our COVID-19 Response\nWe believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities, and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members.\nThe Intuitive Foundation is a nonprofit organization established and funded by Intuitive in 2018. Since its founding, the Intuitive Foundation has been dedicated to promoting health, advancing education, and reducing human suffering. The Foundation supports outreach programs financially while we provide the volunteers and mentors from within our company. Since its inception, we have contributed $55 million to the Intuitive Foundation to fulfill its mission.\nThe events of 2020 inspired Intuitive employees to further support the Foundation\u2019s work on several key initiatives. The Foundation\u2019s multifaceted response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a major focus in 2020. From the first days of the pandemic, Intuitive and the Intuitive Foundation engaged within the communities in which we live and work. We converted some of our manufacturing lines to produce PPE, donating more than a million face shields globally through the Intuitive Foundation. Employees and their families sewed facemasks and volunteered in their communities. Our engineers helped design and implement updates to ventilators that made them easier to produce. Some of our medically trained employees volunteered as healthcare workers on the front lines. Lastly, Intuitive and the Intuitive Foundation, along with many employees, contributed financially to support COVID-19 relief.\nWe encourage you to review the \"Talent and workplace experience\" and \"Creating stronger communities\" section of our Sustainability Report 2020 (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider each of the following risk factors, which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks.\nRISK FACTORS SUMMARY\nSUMMARY OF RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\n\u2022Because our markets are highly competitive, customers may choose to purchase our competitors\u2019 products or services or may not accept da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery, which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share.\n\u2022If our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\n\u2022Public health crises or epidemic diseases, or the perception of their effects, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022If institutions or surgeons are unable to obtain coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures using our products, or if reimbursement is insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing our products, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to support our business.\n\u2022If defects occur in our products, we may incur additional unforeseen costs, hospitals may not purchase our products, and our reputation may suffer.\n\u2022We are subject to product liability and negligence claims relating to the use of our products and other legal proceedings that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, divert management\u2019s attention, and harm our business.\n\u2022We are subject to significant, uninsured liabilities.\n\u2022Negative publicity, whether accurate or inaccurate, concerning our products or our company could reduce market acceptance of our products and could result in decreased product demand and a decline in revenues.\n\u2022If we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, our ability to compete will be harmed.\n\u2022Our reliance on sole and single source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within budget.\n\u2022We experience long and variable capital sales cycles and seasonality in our business, which may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\n\u2022New product developments and introductions may adversely impact our financial results.\n\u2022We are subject to a variety of risks due to our operations outside of the U.S.\n\u2022Disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business, customer relations, and financial condition.\n\u2022Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters relating to information collection.\n\u2022If we fail to successfully acquire or integrate new businesses, products, and technology, we may not realize expected benefits or our business may be harmed.\n\u2022If we do not successfully manage our collaboration arrangements, licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or partnerships with third parties, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022Our customers may use unauthorized or unapproved instruments and accessories, which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share.\n\u2022We expect gross profit margins to vary over time, and changes in our gross profit margins could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022We utilize distributors for a portion of our sales, which subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our business.\n\u2022We offer alternative capital acquisition approaches. As a result, we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and the risk of losses of revenue, which could result in material losses.\n\u2022We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market value of our investments.\n\u2022We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.\n\u2022We may encounter manufacturing problems or delays that could result in lost revenue.\n\u2022Disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent products from being developed, approved, or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Continued consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\n\u2022Economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our company.\n\u2022Natural disasters or other events beyond our control could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or higher expenses.\n\u2022Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations.\n\u2022We use estimates, make judgments, and apply certain methods in determining our financial results and in measuring the progress of our business. As these estimates, judgments, and methods change, our results of operations and our assessment of the progress of our business could vary.\nSUMMARY OF RISKS RELATING TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\u2022Complying with FDA regulations is a complex process, and our failure to comply fully could subject us to significant enforcement actions.\n\u2022Our products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain domestic regulatory review process. If we do not obtain and maintain the necessary domestic regulatory authorizations, we will not be able to sell our products in the U.S.\n\u2022If our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal, state, or other manufacturing standards, we may be required to temporarily cease all of our manufacturing operations, import/export of our products, and/or recall some products, which would result in significant product delivery delays and lost revenue.\n\u2022Our products are subject to international regulatory processes and approval requirements. If we do not obtain and maintain the necessary international regulatory approvals, we will not be able to sell our products in foreign countries.\n\u2022Changes in healthcare legislation and policy may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws governing our business practices, which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties. Additionally, challenges to, or investigation into, our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to and, thus, could harm our business.\n\u2022If hospitals and other surgery facilities do not continue to meet federal, state, or other regulatory standards, they may be required to temporarily cease all or part of their da Vinci utilization.\nSUMMARY OF RISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\u2022If we are unable to fully protect and successfully defend our intellectual property from use by third parties, our ability to compete in the market will be harmed.\n\u2022Others may be successful in asserting that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, which may cause us to pay substantial damages and/or enjoin us from commercializing our products.\n\u2022Our products rely on licenses from third parties, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we lose access to these technologies, our revenues could decline.\nSUMMARY OF GENERAL RISKS\n\u2022Our future operating results may be below securities analysts' or investors' expectations, which could cause our stock price to decline.\n\u2022Our stock price has been, and will likely continue to be volatile.\n\u2022Changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nBECAUSE OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE TO PURCHASE OUR COMPETITORS\u2019 PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MAY NOT ACCEPT DA VINCI ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE.\nRobotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci Surgical System is a technology that competes with established and emerging treatment options in both disease management and reconstructive medical procedures. These competitive treatment options include conventional MIS, open surgery, interventional approaches, and pharmacological regimens. Some of these procedures are widely accepted in the medical community and, in many cases, have a long history of use. Technological advances could make such treatments more effective or less expensive than using our products, which could render our products obsolete or unmarketable. Studies could be published that show that other treatment options are more beneficial and/or cost-effective than robotic-assisted surgery. We cannot be certain that physicians will use our products to replace or supplement established treatments or that our products will continue to be competitive with current or future technologies.\nAdditionally, we face or expect to face competition from companies that develop or have developed wristed, robotic-assisted, or computer-assisted surgical systems and products. Companies have introduced products in the field of robotic surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field including, but not limited to, the following companies: avateramedical GmbH; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson (including their wholly-owned subsidiaries Auris Health, Inc. and Verb Surgical Inc.); Medicaroid, Inc.; Medrobotics Corporation; Medtronic plc; MicroPort Scientific Corporation; Olympus Corporation; Samsung Group; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; Smart Robot Technology Group Co. Ltd.; Titan Medical Inc.; and TransEnterix, Inc. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become competitors. Our revenues may be reduced due to pricing pressure or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective or less expensive than our products. If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues will suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations, or cash flows. We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors, especially those with greater resources.\nIn addition, third-party service providers that provide services to da Vinci Surgical System operators may emerge and compete with us on price or offerings. To date, substantially all of our customers have sourced services on their da Vinci Surgical Systems from us through service contract commitments or time and materials contracts. Furthermore, there are third-party service providers offering consulting services targeted at analyzing the cost-effectiveness of hospitals\u2019 robotic-assisted surgery programs, including procedures performed, placement of systems, and consumption of instruments and accessories. We currently provide similar services and analysis to our customers, but it is difficult to assess the impact that this may have on our business. If we are unable to compete successfully with any third-party service providers, our revenues may suffer.\nIF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE THE REVENUE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS.\nThe da Vinci Surgical System and our other products represent a fundamentally new way of performing surgery. Achieving physician, patient, and third-party payor acceptance of robotic-assisted surgery as a preferred method of performing surgery is crucial to our success. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, customers will not purchase our products, and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business. We believe that physicians\u2019 and third-party payors\u2019 acceptance of the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients. Physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing surgical techniques. Even if we can prove the effectiveness of our products through clinical trials, surgeons may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons. For example, cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional heart surgery simply because such surgery is already widely accepted. In addition, surgeons may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third-party payors, particularly in light of ongoing healthcare reform initiatives and the evolving U.S. healthcare environment.\nWe expect that there will be a learning process involved for surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products. Broad use of our products will require training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training. We may not be able to rapidly train surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products.\nPUBLIC HEALTH CRISES OR EPIDEMIC DISEASES, OR THE PERCEPTION OF THEIR EFFECTS, HAVE HAD AND COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as the current outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). To date, COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, our supply chains and distribution systems, and our expenses, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, and governments are taking. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products as healthcare customers divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of that disease. In addition, our customers have delayed, cancelled, or redirected and, in the future, may delay, cancel, or redirect planned capital expenditures in order to focus resources on COVID-19 or in response to economic disruption related to COVID-19. For example, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, in the first half of 2020, we experienced a significant decline in procedure volume in the U.S. and Western Europe, as healthcare systems diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19. In addition, U.S. and global public health bodies have, at times, recommended delaying elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic, and surgeons and medical societies are evaluating the risks of minimally invasive surgeries in the presence of infectious diseases, which we expect will continue to negatively impact the usage of our products and the number of da Vinci procedures performed. Also, we may experience delays in obtaining new product approvals or clearances from the FDA or delays in recruiting patients for clinical trials needed for new product approvals.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have experienced significant business disruptions, including restrictions on our ability to travel as well as distribute and service our products, temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers, and a reduction in access to our customers due to diverted resources and priorities and the business hours of hospitals, as governments institute prolonged shelter-in-place and/or self-quarantine mandates. For example, our corporate headquarters and many of our operations, including certain of our manufacturing facilities, are located in California, which has instituted risk reduction orders applicable to our employees in that region, significantly impacting the ability of our employees to get to their places of work to produce products and hampering our products from moving through the supply chain. These unprecedented measures to slow the spread of the virus taken by local governments and healthcare authorities globally, including the deferral of elective medical procedures and social distancing measures, have had, and will continue to have, a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the economies and financial markets of many countries, which may result in a period of regional, national, and global economic slowdown or regional, national, or global recessions that could curtail or delay spending by hospitals and affect demand for our products as well as increased risk of customer defaults or delays in payments. Our customers may terminate or amend their agreements for the purchase, lease, or service of our products due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures, or other reasons. COVID-19 and the current financial, economic, and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, volume of business, results of operations, and cash flows. Due to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we are unable to estimate the impacts on our operations and financial results.\nOutbreaks of other epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as, historically, the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or the H1N1 virus, could also divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of that disease. An outbreak of other contagious diseases could negatively affect hospital admission rates or disrupt our business similar to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted above. Any of these outbreaks could negatively impact the number of da Vinci procedures performed and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIF INSTITUTIONS OR SURGEONS ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FOR PROCEDURES USING OUR PRODUCTS, OR IF REIMBURSEMENT IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF PURCHASING OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT SALES TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS.\nIn the U.S., hospitals generally bill for the services performed with our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, other government programs, and private insurance plans. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if government and private payors\u2019 policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. In addition, to the extent that there is a shift from an inpatient setting to outpatient settings, we may experience pricing pressure and a reduction in the number of procedures performed. Our success in OUS markets also depends upon the eligibility of our products for coverage and reimbursement through government-sponsored healthcare payment systems and third-party payors. Reimbursement practices vary significantly by country. Many OUS markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. Other foreign markets have both\nprivate insurance systems and government-managed systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. Market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability and level of coverage and reimbursement in any country within a particular time. In addition, healthcare cost containment efforts similar to those in the U.S. are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we intend to sell our products, and these efforts are expected to continue. Please see our risk factor below titled \u201cChanges in Healthcare Legislation and Policy May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional risks related to the ability of institutions or surgeons to obtain reimbursements.\nIF DEFECTS OCCUR IN OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL UNFORESEEN COSTS, HOSPITALS MAY NOT PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR REPUTATION MAY SUFFER.\nOur success depends on the quality and reliability of our products. While we subject components sourced and products manufactured to stringent quality specifications and processes, our products incorporate mechanical parts, electrical components, optical components, and computer software, any of which may contain errors or exhibit failures, especially when products are first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures, due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure, we and our customers have an increased sensitivity to such defects. In the past, we have voluntarily recalled certain products. Although our products are subject to stringent quality processes and controls, we cannot provide assurance that our products will not experience component aging, errors, or performance problems. If we experience product flaws or performance problems, any or all of the following could occur:\n\u2022delays in product shipments;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022delay in market acceptance;\n\u2022diversion of our resources;\n\u2022damage to our reputation;\n\u2022product recalls;\n\u2022regulatory actions;\n\u2022increased service or warranty costs; or\n\u2022product liability claims.\nCosts associated with product flaws or performance problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS RELATING TO THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, DIVERT MANAGEMENT\u2019S ATTENTION, AND HARM OUR BUSINESS.\nWe are, and may become, subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. Certain current lawsuits and pending proceedings to which we are party, including purported class actions, product liability litigation, and patent litigation, are described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nIn particular, our business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims, which are inherent to the medical device industry. Product liability claims have been brought against us by, or on behalf of, individuals alleging that they have sustained personal injuries and/or death as a result of purported product defects, the alleged failure to warn, and/or the alleged inadequate training by us of physicians regarding the use of the da Vinci Surgical System. The individuals who have brought the product liability claims seek recovery for their alleged personal injuries and, in many cases, punitive damages. Current product liability claims have resulted in negative publicity regarding our Company, and these and any other product liability or negligence claims or product recalls also could harm our reputation. Please see our risk factor below titled \u201cNegative Publicity, Whether Accurate or Inaccurate, Concerning Our Products or Our Company Could Reduce Market Acceptance of Our Products and Could Result in Decreased Product Demand and a Decline in Revenues\u201d for additional risks related to the potential effects of negative publicity on our business.\nThe outcome of these product liability claims and other legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. We currently self-insure our product liability risk and maintain third-party insurance coverage for certain other liabilities. However, we cannot determine whether our insurance coverage from third-party carriers, or our self-insurance of product liability risk, would be sufficient to cover the costs or potential losses related to these lawsuits and proceedings or otherwise be excluded under the terms of any third-party policy. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant legal costs (including settlements, judgments, legal fees, and other related defense costs) and diversion of management attention. If we do not prevail in the purported class actions, product liability litigation, or other legal proceedings,\nwe may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT, UNINSURED LIABILITIES.\nFor certain risks, we do not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or availability. For example, we self-insure our product liability risks, and we indemnify our directors and officers for third-party claims and do not carry insurance to cover that indemnity or the related underlying losses. We also do not carry, among other types of coverage, earthquake and cyber insurance. In addition, in the future, we may not continue to maintain certain existing insurance coverage or adequate levels of coverage. Premiums for many types of insurance have increased significantly in recent years and, depending on market conditions and our circumstances, in the future, certain types of insurance, such as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Because we retain some portion of our insurable risks and, in some cases, we are entirely self-insured, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insurance coverage could require us to pay substantial amounts, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNEGATIVE PUBLICITY, WHETHER ACCURATE OR INACCURATE, CONCERNING OUR PRODUCTS OR OUR COMPANY COULD REDUCE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND COULD RESULT IN DECREASED PRODUCT DEMAND AND A DECLINE IN REVENUES.\nThere have been articles published and reports questioning patient safety and efficacy associated with robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci Surgical System and its cost relative to other disease management methods and the adequacy of surgeon training. Negative publicity, including statements made by public officials, whether accurate or inaccurate, concerning our products or our Company could reduce market acceptance of our products and could result in decreased product demand and a decline in revenues. In addition, significant negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims, regardless of whether these claims are meritorious. The number of claims could be further increased by plaintiffs\u2019 law firms that use a wide variety of media to advertise their services and solicit clients for product liability cases against us.\nIF WE LOSE KEY PERSONNEL OR ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WILL BE HARMED.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. For example, our product development plans depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain engineers with experience in mechanics, electronics, software, and optics. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and competition for qualified personnel is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among technology and healthcare companies and universities. The loss of any of these persons or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nOUR RELIANCE ON SOLE AND SINGLE SOURCE SUPPLIERS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR WITHIN BUDGET.\nSome of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers or single-sourced suppliers. We generally purchase components through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory. While alternative suppliers exist and could be identified for sole-sourced components, the disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components, which could affect our operating results. A disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction, and damage our reputation. Furthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products, we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or within budget, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE EXPERIENCE LONG AND VARIABLE CAPITAL SALES CYCLES AND SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS, WHICH MAY CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nThe sales and purchase order cycle of our da Vinci Surgical System is lengthy, because it is a major capital item and its purchase generally requires the approval of senior management of hospitals, their parent organizations, purchasing groups, and government bodies, as applicable. In addition, sales to some of our customers are subject to competitive bidding or public tender processes. These approval and bidding processes can be lengthy. As a result, hospitals may delay or accelerate system purchases in conjunction with the timing of their capital budget timelines. Further, IDN groups are creating larger networks of da Vinci system users with increasing purchasing power and are increasingly evaluating their robotic-assisted surgery programs to optimize the efficiency of surgeries using da Vinci Surgical Systems. Further, the introduction of new products could adversely impact our sales cycle as customers take additional time to assess the benefits and costs of such products. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict the length of capital sales cycles and, therefore, the exact timing of capital sales. Historically, our\nsales of da Vinci Surgical Systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset.\nWe have experienced procedure growth for a number of benign conditions, including hysterectomies, sacrocolpopexies, hernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and certain other surgeries. Many of these types of surgeries may be postponed in the short term by patients to avoid vacation periods and for other personal scheduling reasons. Patients may also accelerate procedures to take advantage of insurance funding cut-off dates. Historically, we have experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third quarters of the year and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth quarters of the year. The timing of procedures and changes in procedure growth directly affect the timing of instrument and accessory purchases and capital purchases by customers.\nThe above factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Because of these fluctuations, it is possible that, in future periods, our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. These fluctuations, among other factors, also mean that our operating results in any particular period may not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nNEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS AND INTRODUCTIONS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nWe develop and introduce new products with enhanced features and extended capabilities from time to time. We may introduce new products that target different markets than what our existing products target. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful research and development, regulatory clearances or approvals, pricing, competition, market and consumer acceptance, the effective forecasting and management of product demand, inventory levels, the management of manufacturing and supply costs, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.\nWe invest substantially in various research and development projects to expand our product offerings. Our research and development efforts are critical to our success, and our research and development projects may not be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers or meet our expectations. Our research and development investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. In addition, the introduction or announcement of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or reduce demand for our current products, thereby offsetting any benefits of successful product introductions and potentially leading to challenges in managing inventory of existing products.\nOur products are subject to various regulatory processes, and we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals in order to sell our new products. If a potential purchaser believes that we plan to introduce a new product in the near future or if a potential purchaser is located in a country where a new product that we have introduced has not yet received regulatory clearance, planned purchases may be deferred or delayed. In the past, we have experienced a slowdown in demand for existing products in advance of new product introductions and may experience a slowdown in demand in the future as well. It is also possible that a new product introduction could cause downward pressure on the prices of our existing products or require us to change how we sell our products, either of which could have material adverse effect on our revenues.\nIf we fail to effectively develop new products and manage new product introductions in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS DUE TO OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.\nWe manufacture, perform research and development activities, and distribute our products in OUS markets. Revenue from OUS markets accounted for approximately 32%, 30%, and 29% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our OUS operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022failure to obtain or maintain the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property rights as we have in the U.S.;\n\u2022multiple OUS regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products;\n\u2022changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022protectionist laws, policies, and business practices that favor local competitors or lead to non-U.S. customers favoring domestic technology solutions, which could slow our growth in OUS markets;\n\u2022local or national regulations that make it difficult or impractical to market or use our products;\n\u2022U.S. relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate;\n\u2022inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;\n\u2022the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing OUS operations, including differing labor relations;\n\u2022the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets;\n\u2022building and maintaining an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations, including appropriate business procedures and controls;\n\u2022anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials;\n\u2022antitrust and anti-competition laws;\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; and\n\u2022business interruptions due to natural disasters, outbreak of disease, and other events beyond our control.\nWe have increased, and will continue to increase, our operations in China. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China and the U.S., that political, diplomatic, military, or other events could result in business disruptions, including increased regulatory enforcement against companies, tariffs, trade embargoes, and export restrictions. Any of these events could reduce customer demand, increase the cost of our products and services, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our customers' and suppliers' businesses and results of operations.\nFor example, in 2020, the U.S. government amended the Entity List rules to expand the requirement to obtain a license prior to the export of certain technologies. In addition, in 2020, a new U.S. regulation seeks to prohibit the U.S. government from contracting with companies who use the products or services of certain Chinese companies. We believe that these regulations do not materially impact our business at this time but cannot predict the impact that additional regulatory changes may have on our business in the future. These actions or similar actions may result in policies and regulations in response that could adversely affect our business operations in China, or may otherwise limit our ability to offer our products and services in China and other parts of the world.\nFollowing a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d), the UK formally withdrew from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the EU. The agreement, which is being applied provisionally from January 1, 2021, until it is ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation, and a governance framework, including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the UK and the EU, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and our business would likely be impacted and the demand for our products could be depressed.\nIn addition, the U.S. federal government has made changes to U.S. trade policy, including entering into a successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\"), effective as of July 1, 2020. In addition, the U.S. federal government has implemented, or is considering the imposition of, tariffs on certain foreign goods. Such tariffs and, if enacted, any further legislation or actions taken by the U.S. federal government that restrict trade, such as additional tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist or retaliatory measures taken by governments in Europe, Asia, and other countries, could adversely impact our ability to sell products and services in our OUS markets. Tariffs could increase the cost of our products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that we earn on our products, which could make our products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit our ability to offer our products and services.\nFurthermore, a large portion of our OUS sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive and/or less affordable in OUS markets.\nIf we are unable to meet and manage these risks, our OUS operations may not be successful, which would limit the growth of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations, or cash flows.\nDISRUPTION OF CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR MATERIAL BREACHES IN THE SECURITY OF OUR SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, CUSTOMER RELATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nInformation technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast, and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.\nOur business requires us to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d). This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of security breaches by unauthorized persons, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. For example, our employees have received \u201cphishing\u201d emails and phone calls attempting to induce them to divulge passwords and other sensitive information.\nIn addition, unauthorized persons may attempt to hack into our products or systems to obtain personal data relating to patients or employees, our confidential or proprietary information, or confidential information we hold on behalf of third parties. If the unauthorized persons successfully hack into or interfere with our connected products or services, they may create issues with product functionality that could pose a risk of loss of data, a risk to patient safety, and a risk of product recall or field activity, which could adversely impact our business and reputation. We have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents, and we make ongoing improvements to our information-sharing products in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may not be able to anticipate and prevent these intrusions or mitigate them when and if they occur.\nWe also rely on external vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems. The systems of these external vendors may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security of our own systems, and we are dependent on these third parties to deploy appropriate security programs to protect their systems.\nWhile we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. We may experience a breach of our systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, including several years or longer. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs, and security vulnerabilities could be significant. Our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and harm to our business operations. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, and use of our products and services could decrease. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPLEX AND EVOLVING LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, AND OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO INFORMATION COLLECTION.\nThere are numerous state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, decisions, and directives regarding privacy and the collection, storage, transmission, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of different types of personal data and personal information (\"Personal Information\") and other customer or other data, the scope of which is continually evolving and subject to differing interpretations. We may be subject to significant consequences, including penalties and fines, for any failure to comply with such laws, regulations, and directives.\nFor example, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"), which is in effect across the European Economic Area (the \"EEA\"), imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data and increased our obligations, for example, by imposing higher standards when obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, requiring more robust disclosures to individuals, strengthening individual data rights, shortening timelines for data breach notifications, limiting retention periods and secondary use of information, increasing requirements pertaining to health data as\nwell as pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and imposing additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric, or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year and other administrative penalties. Compliance with the new data protection rules imposed by GDPR may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCalifornia recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which is considered by many to be the most far-reaching data privacy law introduced in the US to date and which introduces new compliance burdens on many organizations doing business in California who collect Personal Information about California residents. The CCPA\u2019s definition of Personal Information is very broad and specifically includes biometric information. The CCPA took effect in 2020 and will allow for significant fines by the state attorney general, as well as a private right of action from individuals in relation to certain security breaches. The enactment of the CCPA is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other US states and creating the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. These developments are increasing our compliance burden and our risk, including risks of regulatory fines, litigation and associated reputational harm. Additionally, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d) recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.\nIn addition, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of Personal Information from the EEA to the United States. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (\"Privacy Shield\") under which Personal Information could be transferred from the EU to US entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of EU-specified standard contractual clauses (a form of contract approved by the EU commission as an adequate Personal Information transfer mechanism), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that their use must be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the surveillance laws and right of individuals in the destination country. The CJEU went on to state that, if the competent supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the recipient country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means, such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer unless the data exporter has already done so itself.\nWe rely on a mixture of mechanisms to transfer personal data from our EU business to the U.S. (including having previously relied on Privacy Shield) and are evaluating what additional mechanisms may be required to establish adequate safeguards for Personal Information. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on Personal Information export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, and/or regulatory investigations or fines. Moreover, if we are unable to transfer Personal Information between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services and could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn Israel, The Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981 (the \u201cIsraeli Privacy Law\u201d) regulates the protection of privacy and personal data, along with several other specific regulations enacted thereunder and, in particular, the Privacy Protection Regulations (Data Security), 5777-2017 (together, the \u201cIsraeli Privacy Law and Regulations\u201d). Under the Israeli Privacy Law and Regulations, organizations are subject to various privacy and data protection requirements, including mandatory registration of databases with the Israeli Registrar of Databases (if certain conditions are met), executing data processing agreements with data recipients, safeguarding the collection and processing of personal data, safeguarding the transfer of personal data (which is specifically subject to the requirements of the Privacy Protection Regulations), personal data breach notification obligations, and other requirements. The Privacy Protection Authority (the \u201cPPA\u201d) is responsible for enforcement of the Israeli Privacy Law and Regulations and periodically publishes opinions and guidelines on privacy matters. In terms of enforcement, failure to comply with the Israeli Privacy Law and Regulations can result in PPA investigations, administrative fines or sanctions, and civil or criminal actions (civil proceedings may include statutory damages without the need to prove actual damages).\nFurthermore, any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with or make effective modifications to our policies or to comply with any federal, state, or international privacy, data-retention, or data-protection-related laws, regulations, orders, or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, a loss of customer confidence, damage to our brand and reputation, and a loss of customers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, various federal, state, and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data-retention, and data-protection issues, including laws or regulations mandating disclosure to domestic or international law enforcement bodies, which could adversely impact our business or our reputation\nwith customers. For example, some countries have adopted laws mandating that some Personal Information regarding customers in their country be maintained solely in their country. Having to maintain local data centers and redesign product, service, and business operations to limit Personal Information processing to within individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly.\nIF WE FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRE OR INTEGRATE NEW BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, AND TECHNOLOGY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE EXPECTED BENEFITS OR OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED.\nWe need to grow our businesses in response to changing technologies, customer demands, and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may decide to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses, products, or technologies rather than through internal development.\nIdentifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or successfully complete identified acquisitions. In addition, completing an acquisition can divert our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could harm our business and affect our financial results. Even if we complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations, products, technologies, or employees into our operations or may not fully realize some of the expected synergies. An acquired company may have deficiencies in product quality, regulatory marketing authorizations, or intellectual property protections, which are not detected during due diligence activities or which are unasserted at the time of acquisition. It may be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming for us to re-establish market access, regulatory compliance, or cure such deficiencies in product quality or intellectual property protection in such cases, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIntegrating an acquisition can also be expensive and time-consuming and may strain our resources. In many instances, integrating a new business will also involve implementing or improving internal controls appropriate for a public company at a business that lacks them. In addition, we may be unable to retain the employees of acquired companies or the acquired company\u2019s customers, suppliers, distributors, or other partners for a variety of reasons, including that these entities may be our competitors or may have close relationships with our competitors. In 2019, we acquired certain assets and operations from Sch\u00f6lly Fiberoptic GmbH, a supplier of endoscopes and other visualization equipment and, in 2020, we acquired Orpheus Medical Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (\u201cOrpheus Medical\u201d) to deepen and expand our integrated informatics platform. The integration of these acquisitions involves complex operations across different geographic locations and new products, distribution networks, and legal jurisdictions. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we can successfully integrate either or both of these acquisitions or realize the expected benefits from these acquisitions. Failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS, LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS, JOINT VENTURES, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, OR PARTNERSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM SUCH ALLIANCES, WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.\nFrom time to time, we enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or partnerships to complement or augment our research and development, product development, training, procedure development, and marketing efforts. For example, in 2016, we entered into an agreement to form the Joint Venture. In January 2019, the Joint Venture acquired certain assets related to the da Vinci distribution business of Chindex, a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma, which has been our distribution partner for da Vinci Surgical Systems in China since 2011, following which the Joint Venture began direct distribution operations for da Vinci products and services in China. There can be no assurance that we and the Joint Venture can successfully complete the development of robotic-assisted, catheter-based medical devices, or that we and the Joint Venture will successfully commercialize such products. There can also be no assurance that the Joint Venture will not require additional contributions to fund its business, that the Joint Venture will become profitable, or that the acquired Chindex assets will be successfully integrated and that the expected benefits will be realized. Proposing, negotiating, and implementing collaborations, in-licensing agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. In addition, other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, technology, or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. As a result, we may not identify, secure, or complete any such arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or on otherwise favorable terms, if it all.\nThere can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits from these alliances. In addition, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding any collaboration or other arrangement, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our alliances may have economic or business interests that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our interests. It is possible that conflicts may arise in these relationships, such as conflicts concerning the achievement of performance milestones or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations, termination rights, or the ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the\ncollaboration. These alliances can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of the parties involved, and we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.\nThere can be no assurance that we will realize a return on our strategic investments. Further, if we acquire privately held companies, valuations of such companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that our investments in privately held companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record impairments, which could be material and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThese alliances may also involve significant expense and divert the focus and attention of our management and other key personnel. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, or disrupt our ordinary business activities. Such arrangements may also expose us to numerous known and unknown risks, including unique risks with respect to the economic, political, and regulatory environment of any foreign entities with whom we partner, including Fosun Pharma. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOUR CUSTOMERS MAY USE UNAUTHORIZED OR UNAPPROVED INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated through our sales of instruments and accessories. Third parties have attempted to and may discover ways to manufacture and sell counterfeit reprocessed instruments and/or alter instruments that are compatible and function with the da Vinci Surgical System, and such activities may reduce our market share. While our sales arrangements with customers generally prohibit the use of unauthorized or unapproved instruments and accessories with da Vinci Surgical Systems, warranties will be void if such instruments and accessories are used, and a programmed memory chip inside each instrument is designed to prevent the instrument from being used for more than the prescribed number of procedures to help ensure that its performance meets specifications during each procedure, these measures may not prevent the use of unauthorized or unapproved instruments and accessories by our customers. In addition to potential reductions to our revenues and market share, sales of unauthorized instruments and accessories by third parties may create safety and health risks to da Vinci patients and could cause negative publicity for us if these products cause injuries and/or do not function as intended when used with da Vinci Surgical Systems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE EXPECT GROSS PROFIT MARGINS TO VARY OVER TIME, AND CHANGES IN OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGINS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur gross profit margins have fluctuated from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. Our gross profit margins may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including the mix of da Vinci Surgical System models sold or leased;\n\u2022changes in the portion of sales involving a trade-in of another system and the amount of trade-in credits given;\n\u2022introduction of new products, which may have lower margins than our existing products;\n\u2022our ability to maintain or reduce production costs;\n\u2022changes to our pricing strategy;\n\u2022changes in competition;\n\u2022changes in production volume driven by demand for our products;\n\u2022changes in material, labor, or other manufacturing-related costs, including the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for foreign currency-denominated costs;\n\u2022changes to U.S. and foreign trade policies, such as the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. including, but not limited to, goods imported from Mexico where we manufacture a majority of our instruments that we sell;\n\u2022inventory obsolescence and product recall charges; and\n\u2022market conditions.\nIf we are unable to offset the unfavorable impact of the factors noted above by increasing the volume of products shipped, reducing product manufacturing costs, or otherwise, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWE UTILIZE DISTRIBUTORS FOR A PORTION OF OUR SALES, WHICH SUBJECTS US TO A NUMBER OF RISKS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.\nWe have strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products in certain foreign countries. If these strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced, our revenues and/or ability to sell or service our products in the markets serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits against our distributors related to sales or service of our products performed by them. Please see our risk factor below titled \u201cWe Are Subject to Product Liability and Negligence Claims Relating to the Use of Our Products and Other Legal Proceedings That Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Divert Management\u2019s Attention, and Harm Our Business.\u201d Our distributors may affect our ability to effectively market our products in certain foreign countries or regulatory jurisdictions if a distributor holds the regulatory authorization in such countries or within such regions and causes, by action or inaction, the suspension of such marketing authorization or sanctions for non-compliance. It may be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming for us to re-establish market access or regulatory compliance in such cases.\nWE OFFER ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL ACQUISITION APPROACHES. AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE RISK OF LOSSES OF REVENUE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES.\nWe believe customer financing through leasing is an important consideration for some of our customers and have experienced an increase in demand for customer financing. We may experience loss from a customer\u2019s failure to make payments according to the contractual lease terms. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty, or other customer-specific factors.\nAlthough we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing credit risks relating to these lease financing arrangements. If the level of credit losses we experience in the future exceed our expectations, such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our leasing arrangements allow customers to cancel, return, or upgrade the systems leased prior to the end of the lease term without incurring a financial penalty. We also lease our systems to certain qualified customers where the lease payments are based on their usage of the systems. While leases and usage-based arrangements enable our customers to upgrade and get access to new technologies faster, it may also enable competitors to more easily induce customers to switch to a competitor system. If customers do not perform a sufficient number of procedures on systems leased under usage-based arrangements, or return or terminate leases prematurely, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations, or cash flows.\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS.\nOur investment portfolio includes both domestic and international investments. The credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity concerns, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could fluctuate substantially. Our other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of investments, impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments, changes in interest rates, increases or decreases in cash balances, volatility in foreign exchange rates, and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty could increase the risk that actual amounts realized on our investments may differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.\nOur Intuitive Ventures fund plans to invest in early-stage companies, which involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, uncertainties inherent in research and development; uncertainties regarding the ability of Intuitive Ventures to identify investment candidates; uncertainties regarding the success of Intuitive Ventures\u2019 investments; uncertainties and variables inherent in the operating and financial performance in investments made, including, among other things, competitive developments and general economic, political, business, industry, regulatory and market conditions; future exchange and interest rates; and changes in tax and other laws, regulations, rates and policies.\nWhile we have not realized any significant losses on our cash equivalents, marketable securities, or other investments, future fluctuations in their value could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE MAY INCUR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE.\nOur operating results are subject to volatility due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects our foreign currency-denominated revenue. Margins on OUS revenue could also be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as we may not be able to raise local prices to fully offset the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to our foreign currency-denominated revenue and earnings, may cause us to reduce pricing on our products in our OUS markets and may cause us to incur losses on our foreign currency hedging instruments, thereby limiting the benefit that strengthened foreign currencies could have on our results of operations.\nWe attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity, and expense. Although we have established a hedging program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily related to transactions denominated in the Euro, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, British Pound, and Swiss Franc, and we regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary, our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact caused by unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. See \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional discussion on the impact of foreign exchange risk.\nWE MAY ENCOUNTER MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS OR DELAYS THAT COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE.\nManufacturing our products is a complex process. We (or our critical suppliers) may encounter difficulties in scaling up or maintaining production of our products, including:\n\u2022problems involving production yields;\n\u2022quality control and assurance;\n\u2022component supply shortages;\n\u2022import or export restrictions on components, materials, or technology;\n\u2022shortages of qualified personnel; and\n\u2022compliance with state, federal, and foreign regulations.\nIf demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders. If we are unable to develop or maintain larger-scale manufacturing capabilities, our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nDISRUPTIONS AT THE FDA AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CAUSED BY FUNDING SHORTAGES OR GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERNS COULD HINDER THEIR ABILITY TO HIRE, RETAIN, OR DEPLOY KEY LEADERSHIP AND OTHER PERSONNEL, OR OTHERWISE PREVENT PRODUCTS FROM BEING DEVELOPED, APPROVED, OR COMMERCIALIZED IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.\nHospital, health systems, and physicians depend on a number of government agencies and services to effectively deliver healthcare to their patients. A prolonged government shutdown could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants, or approvals or could cause other situations that could impede their ability to effectively deliver healthcare, including attempts to reduce payments and other reimbursements to hospitals by federal healthcare programs. These situations could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to perform procedures with our devices and/or their decisions to purchase additional products from us.\nIn addition, the ability of the FDA to review and clear or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies, including a prolonged government shutdown, may cause significant regulatory delays and, therefore, delay our efforts to seek clearances or approvals from the FDA and adversely affect business travel and import and export of products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government\nhas shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products through April 2020 and, subsequently, on March 18, 2020, the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, on July 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to resume certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA intends to use this risk-based assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from mission-critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCONTINUED CONSOLIDATION IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe healthcare industry has been consolidating, and organizations continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers. Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators, and third-party payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power within the markets in which we sell our products. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify, resulting in pricing pressures and decreased average selling prices. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further consolidation, which may exert further downward pressure on prices of our products and services and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPANY.\nUncertainty about global economic conditions, including credit and sovereign debt concerns in certain European countries and concerns about slowed economic growth in China and other OUS markets, has caused and may continue to cause disruptions in the financial credit markets, volatile currency exchange rates, concerns about inflation, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, and liquidity concerns. Customers and distributors may choose to postpone or reduce spending due to financial difficulties or may be unable to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products due to restraints on credit. There could be additional effects from adverse conditions in the credit markets on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance the development and/or manufacturing of our products resulting in product delays.\nIn addition, our business is closely tied to the overall U.S. healthcare system, relating to which there are concerns and uncertainties as a result of efforts made by the U.S. federal government to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. In addition, the U.S. federal government has called for, or enacted, substantial changes to trade, fiscal, and tax policies, which may include changes to existing trade agreements including, but not limited to, the replacement of NAFTA by the USMCA (effective July 1, 2020), that may have a significant impact on our operations. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these changes could have on our business.\nIf economic conditions worsen or new legislation is passed related to the healthcare system or trade, fiscal, or tax policies, customer demand may not materialize to the levels we require to achieve our anticipated financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULT IN LOSS OF REVENUE OR HIGHER EXPENSES.\nNatural disasters, terrorist activities, and other business disruptions including, but not limited to, internet security threats and violence motivated by political or social causes, could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and their aftermath created economic uncertainty and disrupted economic activities in Japan, including a reduction in hospital spending. Moreover, global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Our corporate headquarters and many of our operations, including certain of our manufacturing facilities, are located in California, which has experienced both severe earthquakes and other natural disasters in the past and is vulnerable to climate change effects. For example, increasing intensity of drought throughout the state and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages in the communities where we work and live. This danger has the potential to impact our employees' abilities to commute to work or to work from home and stay connected effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not\nhave multiple-site capacity for all of our operations in the event of a business disruption. Furthermore, parties in our supply chain and our customers are similarly vulnerable to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen, and severe adverse events. A natural disaster in any of our major markets, or an unanticipated business disruption caused, for example, by internet security threats, damage to global communication networks, or similar events, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate, including:\n\u2022the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022changes in availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions;\n\u2022changes in share-based compensation; and\n\u2022changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe are unable to predict what changes to the tax laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWE USE ESTIMATES, MAKE JUDGMENTS, AND APPLY CERTAIN METHODS IN DETERMINING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND IN MEASURING THE PROGRESS OF OUR BUSINESS. AS THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND METHODS CHANGE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRESS OF OUR BUSINESS COULD VARY.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in any of our assumptions may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nWe utilize methods for determining surgical market sizes as well as the number and type (cancerous or benign) of certain da Vinci procedures performed that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our estimates of surgical market sizes or the number and type of da Vinci procedures performed do not have an impact on our results of operations but are used to estimate the progress of our business. Estimates and judgments for determining surgical market sizes and the number and type of da Vinci procedures and the accuracy of these estimates may be impacted over time with changes in treatment modalities, hospital reporting behavior, system internet connectivity, distributor reporting behavior, increases in procedures per field employee, and other factors. In addition, from time to time, we may change the method for determining market sizes and the number and type of da Vinci procedures, causing variation in our reporting.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nCOMPLYING WITH FDA REGULATIONS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS, AND OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY FULLY COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.\nBecause our products, including the da Vinci Surgical System, are commercially distributed, numerous quality and post-market regulatory requirements apply, including the following:\n\u2022continued compliance to the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during the development and manufacturing process;\n\u2022labeling regulations;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against false or misleading statements in the labeling or promotion of products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses;\n\u2022stringent complaint reporting and Medical Device Reporting (\u201cMDR\u201d) regulations, which require that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;\n\u2022adequate use of the Corrective and Preventive Actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant, systemic failures of products or processes or in trends which suggest the same; and\n\u2022the reporting of Corrections and Removals, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA recalls and field corrective actions taken to reduce a risk to health or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFFDCA\u201d) that may pose a risk to health.\nWe are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from inspectional observations (Form FDA 483) to a public Warning Letter to more severe civil and criminal sanctions, including the seizure of our products and equipment or ban on the import or export of our products. The FDA has, in the past, issued and could, in the future, issue Warning Letters or other communications to us. If we fail to satisfy or remediate the matters discussed in any such Warning Letters or communications, the FDA could take further enforcement action, including prohibiting the sale or marketing of the affected product. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The receipt of a Warning Letter places certain limits on the ability to obtain FDA-issued Certificates to Foreign Government (\u201cCFGs\u201d) used for new and re-registration of products in certain foreign countries.\nThe FDA also strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion, and other activities relating to the marketing of our products. Medical devices may be promoted only for their cleared or approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the cleared or approved label. It is possible that federal or state enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under a variety of statutory authorities, including under the FFDCA as well as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, any modification or change of medical devices cleared for market requires the manufacturer to make a determination whether the change is significant enough to require new 510(k) clearance. We have created labeling, advertising, and user training for the da Vinci Surgical System to describe specific surgical procedures that we believe are fully within the scope of our existing 510(k) indications for use stated in our 510(k) clearances. Although we have relied on expert in-house and external staff, consultants, and advisors, some of whom were formerly employed by the FDA and are familiar with the FDA perspective, we cannot provide assurance that the FDA would agree that all such specific procedures are within the scope of the existing general clearance or that we have compiled adequate information to support the safety and efficacy of using the da Vinci Surgical System for all such specific procedures. From time to time, we modify our products, including the hardware and software in the da Vinci Surgical System, after we obtain 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the devices in ways that we do not believe require new 510(k) clearance. We cannot provide assurance that the FDA would agree in all cases with our determinations not to seek new 510(k) clearance for any of these changes. If the FDA disagrees with our assessments that a new 510(k) clearance was not required prior to commercializing the devices with these changes or modifications, then the FDA could impose enforcement sanctions and/or require us to obtain 510(k) clearance for any modification to our products. We may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until such 510(k) clearance is granted.\nWe have a wholly owned manufacturing facility located in Mexicali, Mexico, which manufactures reusable and disposable surgical instruments. This facility is registered with the FDA as well as with Mexican authorities. The facility is operated under U.S. and international quality system regulations, including those applicable to Canada, the EU, and Japan among others. Our wholly owned manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico has an FDA Establishment Registration but has not been inspected by the FDA to date. If the FDA were to identify non-conformances in our product documentation or quality system compliance, it could hold indefinitely the importation of instruments at the border, which would deprive us of the ability to sell and supply the majority of our customers until the FDA requirements have been satisfied. Similar supply disruptions could occur if key suppliers outside of the U.S. were to encounter non-conformances with their documentation or quality system compliance.\nOUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO A LENGTHY AND UNCERTAIN DOMESTIC REGULATORY REVIEW PROCESS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY DOMESTIC REGULATORY AUTHORIZATIONS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE U.S.\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, promotion, sales, distribution, and post-market support and medical device reporting in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In order for us to market products for use in the U.S., we generally must first obtain clearance from the FDA pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Clearance under Section 510(k) requires demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered (\u201cpre-amendment\u201d) status. If we significantly modify our products after they receive FDA clearance, the FDA may require us to submit a separate 510(k) or premarket approval application (\u201cPMA\u201d) for the modified product before we are permitted to market the products in the U.S. In addition, if we develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially equivalent to a device with 510(k)\nclearance or grandfathered status, we will be required to obtain FDA approval by submitting a PMA. A PMA is typically a much more complex, lengthy, and burdensome application than a 510(k). To support a PMA, the FDA would likely require that we conduct one or more clinical studies to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective. In some cases, such studies may be requested for a 510(k) as well. The FDA may not act favorably or quickly in its review of our 510(k) or PMA submissions, or we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain FDA clearance or approval, either of which could delay or preclude the sale of new products in the U.S. Moreover, we may not be able to meet the requirements to obtain 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, in which case the FDA may not grant us necessary clearances or approvals. In addition, the FDA may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition to a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Product applications can also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following clearance or approval. Any delays or failure to obtain FDA clearance or approvals of new products that we develop, any limitations imposed by the FDA on new product use, or the costs of obtaining FDA clearance or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may change their policies, adopt additional regulations, revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. We may be found non-compliant as a result of future changes in, or interpretations of, regulations by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it plans to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals include plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on these proposals. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. Accordingly, it is unclear the extent to which any proposals, if adopted, could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances, or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business.\nMore recently, in September 2019, the FDA finalized guidance describing an optional \u201csafety and performance based\u201d premarket review pathway for manufacturers of \u201ccertain, well-understood device types\u201d to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list device types appropriate for the \u201csafety and performance based\u201d pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible. The FDA may establish performance criteria for classes of devices for which we or our competitors seek or currently have received clearance, and it is unclear the extent to which such performance standards, if established, could impact our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation, administrative, or executive action. For example, the results of the 2020 election may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration took several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities, such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict whether or how these requirements will be implemented and whether or how they will be rescinded or replaced under the Biden administration. The policies and priorities of a new administration are unknown and could materially impact the regulation of our products. If executive actions impose constraints on the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nIn order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a \u201csignificant risk\u201d (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption (\u201cIDE\u201d) application. Many of our products to date have been or would be considered significant risk devices requiring IDE approval prior to investigational use. We may not be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the U.S. for any new devices that we intend to market in the U.S. in the future. If we do obtain such approvals, we may not be able to conduct studies which comply with the IDE and other regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device. Failure to obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Certainty that clinical trials will meet desired endpoints, produce meaningful or useful data, and be free of unexpected adverse effects or that the FDA will accept the validity of foreign clinical study data cannot be assured, and such uncertainty could preclude or delay market clearance or authorizations resulting in significant financial costs and reduced revenue.\nIn addition, some products may be regulated by the FDA as drugs, biologics, or combination devices, which carry still greater requirements for clinical trials, regulatory submissions, and approvals.\nIF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES DO NOT CONTINUE TO MEET FEDERAL, STATE, OR OTHER MANUFACTURING STANDARDS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TEMPORARILY CEASE ALL OR PART OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND/OR RECALL SOME PRODUCTS, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT DELIVERY DELAYS AND LOST REVENUE.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities, and our operations will continue to be regulated and inspected by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements contained in the QSR and other regulatory requirements. We are also required to comply with International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d) quality system standards as well as European Directives and norms in order to produce products for sale in the EU. In addition, many countries, such as Canada and Japan, have very specific additional regulatory requirements for quality assurance and manufacturing. If we fail to continue to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, as well as ISO or other regulatory standards, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations.\nWe continue to be subject to FDA and certain other inspections at any time. Maintaining such compliance is difficult and costly. We cannot be certain that our facilities will be found to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements or ISO standards and other regulatory requirements in future inspections and audits by regulatory authorities.\nWe started participating in the Medical Device Single Audit Program (\u201cMDSAP\u201d), which allows an MDSAP-recognized auditing organization to conduct a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer that evaluates the Company\u2019s quality system to confirm compliance with the requirements of multiple regulatory jurisdictions, including the U.S., Japan, Brazil, Australia, and Canada. The information will be shared and reviewed amongst all the regulatory authorities in the MDSAP, who may or may not determine that additional information or auditing is required.\nOur Sunnyvale, California facility is licensed by the State of California to manufacture medical devices. We have been subject to periodic inspections by the California Department of Health Services Food and Drug Branch and, if we are unable to maintain this license following any future inspections, we will be unable to manufacture or ship some products, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In 2012, the State of California announced suspension of routine inspections, but this policy could be modified or inspections could be resumed for specific circumstances. In addition, both our Sunnyvale, California and Mexicali, Mexico facilities are subject to periodic inspections by other regulatory bodies, including third-party auditors on behalf of national regulatory authorities. Compliance with multiple regulatory standards is complex, difficult, and costly to maintain, and material deficiencies could result in significant limitations on our ability to manufacture, transport, and sell our products in one or more countries.\nOUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY PROCESSES AND APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY APPROVALS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.\nTo be able to sell our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries, which may differ substantially from those of the U.S. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals is complex, and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products or obtain such approvals on a favorable schedule. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, our ability to generate revenue will be harmed. In particular, if the FDA refuses to provide CFGs, our ability to register products or renew such registrations may be delayed or denied.\nThe EU requires that manufacturers of medical products obtain the right to affix the CE mark for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC), as amended, to their products before selling them in member countries of the EU. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European medical device directives. In order to obtain the authorization to affix the CE mark to products, a manufacturer must obtain certification that its processes and products meet certain European quality standards. In January 1999, we received permission to affix the CE mark to our da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments and have maintained this authorization\ncontinuously since that time. From time to time, we seek the authorization to affix the CE mark to new or modified products. Subsequent products and accessories have received marketing authorization by our Notified Body, Presafe.\nAs we modify existing products or develop new products in the future, including new instruments, we currently plan to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. In addition, we are subject to annual regulatory audits in order to maintain the CE mark authorizations we have already obtained, including inspection of our compliance to required standards and directives. We cannot be certain that we will be able to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or that we will continue to meet the quality and performance standards required to maintain the authorizations that we have already received. If we are unable to maintain permission to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the EU and many affiliated countries that accept the CE mark, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Some member states of the EU have additional requirements for registration and notification, which may add to the time and effort to obtain market access. In addition, the regulations applied to end users of our products may increase over time, forcing us to provide additional solutions to regulations that do not apply directly to us but which apply indirectly, as they may limit our customers\u2019 ability to use our products.\nIn May 2017, the EU Medical Device Regulation was implemented to replace the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC), as amended. The Medical Device Regulation ((EU) 2017/745) comes into force on May 26, 2021, and imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and grants Notified Bodies increased post-market surveillance authority. We may be subject to risks associated with additional testing, modification, certification, or amendment of our existing market authorizations, or we may be required to modify products already installed at our customers\u2019 facilities to comply with the official interpretations of these revised regulations. Further, Switzerland, which is the country from which we import our products into the EU and where our EU regulatory team is based, has not yet entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU that covers the Medical Device Regulation and allows medical devices to move freely between Switzerland and the EU. Therefore, we may be required to adjust the manner in which we bring our products into the EU market. Any such adjustments could cause temporary disruptions in and have adverse financial implications to our business in Europe.\nTo date, we received approvals from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (\u201cMHLW\u201d) for our da Vinci S, Si, Xi, and X Surgical Systems and various associated instruments and accessories for use in certain da Vinci procedures. We may seek additional approvals for other products and/or indications; however, there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted. In addition, because not all of our instruments have received product approvals and reimbursement is an additional process to generate market acceptance, it is possible that procedures will be adopted slowly or not at all. Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are reimbursed by governmental health administration authorities. In April 2012 and April 2016, we have received reimbursement approval for prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy, respectively. An additional 12 procedures were granted reimbursement for Japan in April 2018, including gastrectomy, anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. An additional 7 procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2020. These additional 19 reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these 19 procedures, there can be no assurance that adoption will occur or that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to any other da Vinci procedures. There are multiple pathways to obtain reimbursement for procedures including those that require in-country clinical data and which are considered for reimbursed status in April of even-numbered years. If we are not successful in obtaining the necessary reimbursement approvals or obtaining approvals for future products and procedures, then the demand for our products could be limited. These limitations could eliminate a significant market opportunity for our products in Japan.\nOur capital sales in China are subject to importation authorizations and purchasing tender processes. In October 2018, the China National Health Commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in China through 2020. After an adjustment notice was published in the third quarter of 2020, the government will now allow for the total sale of 225 new surgical robots into China, which could include da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. Future system sales and our ability to grow future procedure volumes are dependent on the completion of these purchasing tender authorizations. The timing and magnitude of these future authorizations, which may determine our system placements in future years, is not certain, and we expect to continue to experience variability in the timing of capital sales in China.\nCHANGES IN HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION AND POLICY MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIn the U.S., there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which made changes that have impacted and are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.\nThe PPACA contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansions among other things. This includes fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. The PPACA also implemented a number of Medicare payment system reforms, including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models and appropriated funding for comparative effectiveness research.\nThe taxes imposed by the PPACA and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors for our products, and/or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA as well as efforts by the Trump administration to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. The Trump administration has also announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction (\u201cCSR\u201d) payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for the CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the PPACA. Legislation to appropriate funds for CSR payments has been introduced in Congress, but the future of such legislation is uncertain. In addition, CMS finalized regulations that, effective beginning with the 2020 plan year, give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.\nBecause of the 2017 Tax Act, the PPACA\u2019s individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance coverage was eliminated starting in 2019. It is unclear what impact the elimination of the individual mandate penalty will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA and, therefore, because it was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but it remanded the case back to the district court for further analysis of whether the mandate could be severed from the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on March 2, 2020, and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. The case is expected to be decided by mid-2021. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent pending appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business.\nFurther, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the PPACA. Although the majority of these measures have not been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may continue to consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the PPACA.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension of the 2% cut in Medicare payments from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. MACRA repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019, which are based on various performance measures and physicians\u2019 participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations. It is unclear what impact new quality and payment programs, such as MACRA, may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.\nWe expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our customers. Any changes to, or uncertainty with respect to, future reimbursement rates or changes in hospital admission rates could impact our customers\u2019 demand for our products and services, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFurther, the federal, state, and local governments, Medicare, Medicaid, managed-care organizations, and foreign governments have, in the past, considered, are currently considering, and may, in the future, consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the U.S. or other countries,\nincluding retroactive and prospective rate and coverage criteria changes, competitive bidding or tender processes for certain products and services, and other changes intended to reduce expenditures along with uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether other healthcare policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future, what effect such policies would have on our business, or what effect ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE, AND FOREIGN LAWS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, WHICH, IF VIOLATED, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES. ADDITIONALLY, CHALLENGES TO, OR INVESTIGATION INTO, OUR PRACTICES COULD CAUSE ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND BE COSTLY TO RESPOND TO AND, THUS, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to track and disclose the source of any tantalum, tin, gold, and tungsten used in manufacturing that may originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining regions (so called \u201cconflict minerals\u201d). These metals are central to the technology industry and are present in some of our products as component parts. In most cases, no acceptable alternative material exists that has the necessary properties. Because it is not possible to determine the source of the metals by analysis, we must obtain a good faith description of the source of the intermediate components and raw materials from parties in our supply chain. The components that incorporate those metals may originate from many sources, and we purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have a long and difficult-to-trace supply chain. As the spot price of these materials varies, producers of the metal intermediates can be expected to change the mix of sources used. Accordingly, components and assemblies we buy may have a mix of sources as their origin. We are required to carry out a diligent effort to determine and disclose the source of these materials. There can be no assurance that we can obtain this information accurately or reliably, or at all, from intermediate producers who may be unwilling or unable to provide this information or further identify their sources of supply or to notify us if these sources change. In addition, these metals are subject to price fluctuations and shortages that can affect our ability to obtain the manufactured materials that we rely on at favorable terms or from consistent sources. These changes could have an adverse impact on our ability to manufacture and market our devices and products.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, prohibit payments or other remuneration that could be considered to induce hospitals, physicians, or other potential purchasers of our products either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease, or order of healthcare products or services for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and any other third-party payor programs. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.\nThe government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to government payors, manufacturers can be held liable under the federal false claim act if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.\nThese laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements that we may have with hospitals, physicians, or other potential purchasers of our products. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, speaker, education, and training programs, physician consulting, and other service arrangements. These laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances. Violating anti-kickback laws and false claims laws can result in civil and criminal fines and penalties, which can be substantial and include monetary damages and penalties, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs for non-compliance. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to defend and, thus, could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe federal Physicians Payments Sunshine Act imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians (including family members), certain other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals. Such information must be made publicly available in a searchable format. In addition, device manufacturers\nare required to report and disclose any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, as well as any transfers of value made to such physician owners and investors, during the preceding calendar year. Additionally, on October 25, 2018, President Trump signed into law the \u201cSubstance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promoted Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act\u201d which in part (under a provision entitled \u201cFighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine\u201d) extends the reporting and transparency requirements for physicians in the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021). Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year.\nIn addition, there has been increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians, including the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices, and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians or marketing expenditures and pricing information. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may be found out of compliance with one or more of the requirements, subjecting us to significant civil monetary penalties.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our OUS operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties in the U.S. and/or abroad. These numerous, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations include U.S. laws, such as the FCPA, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nOur operations are subject to certain antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements or practices are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe upon these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and government investigations involving labor and employment. Such claims, lawsuits, and government investigations are inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nIF HOSPITALS AND OTHER SURGERY FACILITIES DO NOT CONTINUE TO MEET FEDERAL, STATE, OR OTHER REGULATORY STANDARDS, THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO TEMPORARILY CEASE ALL OR PART OF THEIR DA VINCI UTILIZATION.\nOur global customers are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities. Our customers are required to comply with applicable local and international regulations, including with respect to the reprocessing of da Vinci instruments and accessories. Hospitals may not follow cleaning and sterilization instructions properly, or equipment used for cleaning and sterilization may malfunction or be used improperly. If our customers deviate from cleaning and sterilization instructions, regulatory authorities may require them to suspend use of da Vinci Surgical Systems.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY PROTECT AND SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM USE BY THIRD PARTIES, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET WILL BE HARMED.\nOur commercial success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for the proprietary technologies contained in our products and on successfully defending our patents against infringing products and/or services in litigation or administrative proceedings, including patent oppositions, reviews, or reexaminations. We will incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and, if necessary, defending our patent rights. We do not know whether we will be successful in obtaining the desired patent protection for our new proprietary technologies or that the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable when challenged. The success of defending our proprietary rights can be highly uncertain, because it involves complex and often evolving legal issues and procedures that are dependent on the particular facts of each case.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on other intellectual property rights, such as trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws to protect proprietary technologies. We further utilize nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as technical measures to protect our proprietary technologies. Nevertheless, these measures may be inadequate in protecting our technologies. If these measures are proved to be inadequate in protecting our technologies, our competitive advantages may be reduced. Moreover, we may not have adequate remedies for potential breaches by employees, consultants, and others who participate in developing our proprietary technologies against their agreements with us regarding intellectual property. As a result, our trade secrets may be lost. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal to or superior to our technologies without infringing any of our intellectual property, which would harm our ability to compete in the market.\nAs foreign markets become more significant in revenue for us, our foreign operations and strategic alliances with foreign entities will likely increase. Our exposure to risks associated with these operations requires us to increase our reliance on protecting our intellectual property against infringing products and/or services in markets outside the U.S. The laws and judicial systems in these countries may introduce yet another level of uncertainty to our effort to obtain the desired protection as well as defending our rights.\nOTHERS MAY BE SUCCESSFUL IN ASSERTING THAT OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES AND/OR ENJOIN US FROM COMMERCIALIZING OUR PRODUCTS.\nAs we continue to introduce and commercialize new products and technologies, there may be U.S. and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to our products. Some of these patents may be broad enough to cover one or more aspects of our products. We do not know whether any of these patents, if challenged, would be held valid, enforceable, and infringed. From time to time, we receive, and likely will continue to receive, letters from third parties accusing us of infringing and/or inviting us to license their patents. We may be sued by, or become involved in an administrative proceeding with, one or more of these third parties.\nWe cannot be certain that a court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses that we may have concerning invalidity, unenforceability, or non-infringement of any third-party patent. In addition, other parties may have filed or will file patent applications covering products that are similar to or identical to ours. We cannot be certain that patents issuing from our own patent applications covering our products will have a priority date over any patents issuing from applications filed by a third party.\nThe medical device industry has experienced extensive intellectual property litigation and administrative proceedings. If third parties assert infringement claims or institute administrative proceedings against us, our technical and management personnel will need to spend significant time and effort, and we will incur large expenses in defending against these attacks. We cannot be certain that we will prevail in defending against infringement, validity, or enforceability claims against us. If plaintiffs in patent administrative proceedings are successful, our patent portfolio may be adversely affected. If plaintiffs in any patent action are successful, we may be enjoined from selling or importing our products, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, or we may be required to obtain a license that requires us to pay substantial royalties or relocate our manufacturing facilities. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline.\nOUR PRODUCTS RELY ON LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE LOSE ACCESS TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES, OUR REVENUES COULD DECLINE.\nWe rely on technology that we license from others, including technology that is integral to our products. There is no assurance that we can obtain licenses on acceptable terms or at all. The license agreements we have entered into with several industry partners may be terminated for breach. If any of these agreements are terminated, we may be unable to reacquire the necessary license on satisfactory terms or at all. The failure to obtain or maintain the licenses could prevent or delay further development or commercialization of our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE BELOW SECURITIES ANALYSTS\u2019 OR INVESTORS\u2019 EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.\nDue to the nascent nature of our industry, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge in our market and affect our business. The revenue and income potential of our market are unproven, and we may be unable to maintain or grow our revenue. Our products typically have lengthy sales cycles. In addition, our costs may be higher than we anticipated. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of operations may be materially adversely\naffected. Further, future revenue from sales of our products is difficult to forecast, because the market for new surgical technologies is still evolving. Our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u2022the extent to which our products achieve and maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022actions relating to regulatory matters;\n\u2022our timing and ability to develop our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022demand for our products;\n\u2022the size and timing of particular sales and any collection delays related to those sales;\n\u2022product quality and supply problems;\n\u2022the progress of surgical training in the use of our products;\n\u2022our ability to develop, introduce, and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis;\n\u2022third-party payor reimbursement policies;\n\u2022our ability to protect our proprietary rights and defend against third-party challenges;\n\u2022our ability to license additional intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022the progress and results of clinical trials.\nOur operating results in any particular period will not be a reliable indication of our future performance. It is possible that, in future periods, our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock and the value of your investment will likely decline.\nOUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN, AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE, VOLATILE.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate significantly in the future. For example, during 2018, it reached a high of $574.74 and a low of $375.25; during 2019, it reached a high of $598.81 and a low of $450.24; and during 2020, it reached a high of $818.10 and a low of $367.75. Our stock price can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022announcements about us or our competitors;\n\u2022variations in operating results and financial guidance;\n\u2022introduction or abandonment of new technologies or products;\n\u2022regulatory approvals and enforcement actions;\n\u2022changes in product pricing policies;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022changes in accounting policies;\n\u2022economic changes and overall market volatility;\n\u2022litigation;\n\u2022media coverage, whether accurate or inaccurate, fair or misleading;\n\u2022political uncertainties;\n\u2022short sales on shares of our common stock or other activities by short sellers; and\n\u2022our stock repurchase program.\nIn addition, stock markets generally have experienced, and in the future may experience significant price and volume volatility. This volatility has a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies. Further, the securities of many medical device companies, including us, have historically been subject to extensive price and volume fluctuations that may affect the market price of their common stock. If these broad market fluctuations continue, it may have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nCHANGES TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nA change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing standards or the reevaluation of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nCOMMON STOCK\nOur common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cISRG.\u201d\nAs of January 15, 2021, there were 159 stockholders of record of our common stock, although we believe that there are a significantly larger number of beneficial owners of our common stock.\nDIVIDENDS\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.\nSECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\nThe following table contains information as of December 31, 2020, for two categories of equity compensation plans.\n(1)Represents options under the Amended and Restated 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan, adopted by the Board in October 2009 and first used in 2010. Options are granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and have a term not to exceed ten years. This plan expired in October 2019 and, therefore, there are no shares reserved for future issuance. However, awards granted prior to the plan's expiration continue to remain outstanding until their original expiration date.\n(2)The weighted-average exercise price is calculated based solely on the exercise prices of the outstanding options and does not reflect the shares that will be issued upon the vesting of outstanding awards of RSUs, which have no exercise price.\nMaterial Features of the Amended and Restated 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan\nIn October 2009, the Board adopted our Amended and Restated 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan, pursuant to Rule 5653(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Global Market, which was subsequently amended by the Board in February 2011, July 2011, February 2012, July 2012, January 2013, May 2013, December 2013, and April 2015.\nAwards granted under the 2009 Plan were intended to constitute \u201cemployment inducement awards\u201d under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) and, therefore, the 2009 Plan was intended to be exempt from the Nasdaq Listing Rules regarding stockholder approval of stock option and stock purchase plans. A total of 4,365,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan provided for the grant of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, dividend equivalents, or stock appreciation rights. These awards may have been granted to individuals who were then new employees, or were commencing employment with us or one of our subsidiaries following a bona fide period of non-employment with us, and for whom such awards were granted as a material inducement to commencing employment with us or one of our subsidiaries. This plan expired in October 2019 and, therefore, there are no shares reserved for future issuance. However, awards granted prior to the plan's expiration continue to remain outstanding until their original expiration date.\nThe 2009 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee or another committee of the Board. The plan administrator has broad discretion to take action under the 2009 Plan, as well as make adjustments to the terms and conditions of existing awards, in the event of certain transactions and events affecting our common stock, including a change in control, stock dividends, stock splits, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, and other corporate transactions. In addition, in the event of certain non-reciprocal transactions with our stockholders known as \u201cequity restructurings,\u201d the plan administrator will make equitable adjustments to the 2009 Plan and outstanding awards.\nThe Board may amend, suspend, or terminate the 2009 Plan at any time, provided that no such action may impair any rights under any outstanding awards without the consent of the participant.\nRECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES\nNone.\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nThe table below summarizes our stock repurchase activity for the quarter ended December 31, 2020.\n(1) Since March 2009, we have had an active stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) had authorized an aggregate amount of up to $7.5 billion for stock repurchases, of which the most recent authorization occurred in January 2019, when the Board increased the authorized amount available under our share repurchase program to $2.0 billion. The remaining $1.6 billion represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of December 31, 2020. The authorized stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nSTOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH\nThe graph set forth below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock between December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2020, with the cumulative total return of (i) the Nasdaq Composite Index, (ii) the S&P 500 Healthcare Index, and (iii) the S&P 500 Index over the same period.

    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nOpen surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. However, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to patients, typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs, and additional pain and suffering relative to minimally invasive surgery (\u201cMIS\u201d), where MIS is available. For over three decades, MIS has reduced trauma to patients by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions. MIS has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures.\nDa Vinci Surgical Systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of MIS to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic, and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of traditional open surgery or conventional MIS. Surgeons using a da Vinci Surgical System operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a 3D, high-definition image of the surgical field. This immersive console connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. While seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to open surgical technique. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of articulation of the surgical instruments used in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon\u2019s hand. In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use.\nOur da Vinci products fall into five broad categories: da Vinci Surgical Systems, da Vinci instruments and accessories, da Vinci Stapling, da Vinci Energy, and da Vinci Vision, including Firefly Fluorescence imaging systems (\u201cFirefly\u201d) and da Vinci Endoscopes. We also provide a comprehensive suite of services, training, and education programs. Within our integrated ecosystem, our products are designed to decrease variability in surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences for surgeons seeking better outcomes. We take a holistic approach, offering intelligent technology and systems designed to work together to make MIS intervention more available and applicable.\nWe have commercialized the following da Vinci Surgical Systems: the da Vinci standard Surgical System in 1999, the da Vinci S Surgical System in 2006, the da Vinci Si Surgical System in 2009, and the fourth generation da Vinci Xi Surgical System in 2014. We have extended our fourth generation platform by adding the da Vinci X Surgical System, commercialized in the second quarter of 2017, and the da Vinci SP Surgical System, commercialized in the third quarter of 2018. We are early in the launch of our da Vinci SP Surgical System, and we have an installed base of 69 da Vinci SP Surgical Systems as of December 31, 2020. Our plans for the rollout of the da Vinci SP Surgical System include putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users first while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain. We received FDA clearances for the da Vinci SP Surgical System for urological and certain transoral procedures. We also received clearance in South Korea where the da Vinci SP Surgical System may be used for a broad set of procedures. We plan to seek FDA clearances for additional indications for da Vinci SP over time. The success of the da Vinci SP Surgical System is dependent on positive experiences and improved clinical outcomes for the procedures for which it has been cleared as well as securing additional clinical clearances. All da Vinci systems include a surgeon\u2019s console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software.\nWe offer approximately 70 different multi-port da Vinci instruments to provide surgeons with flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed to perform a particular surgery. These multi-port instruments are generally robotically controlled and provide end effectors (tips) that are similar to those used in either open or laparoscopic surgery. We offer advanced instrumentation for the da Vinci Xi and da Vinci X platforms, including da Vinci Energy and da Vinci Stapler products, to provide surgeons with sophisticated, computer-aided tools to precisely and efficiently interact with tissue. Da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi Surgical Systems share the same instruments whereas the da Vinci Si Surgical System uses instruments that are not compatible with da Vinci X or da Vinci Xi systems. We currently offer nine core instruments on our da Vinci SP Surgical System. We plan to expand the SP instrument offering over time.\nTraining technologies include our Intuitive Simulation products, our Intuitive Telepresence remote case observation and telementoring tools, and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the FDA cleared our Ion endoluminal system to enable minimally invasive biopsies in the lung. Our Ion system extends our commercial offering beyond surgery into diagnostic procedures with this first application. We are introducing the Ion system in the U.S. in a measured fashion while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain and collect additional clinical data. We are early in the launch and have placed 36 Ion systems for commercial use as of December 31, 2020. Ion systems are not included in our da Vinci Surgical System installed base. We currently have 3 Ion systems placed with hospitals for gathering clinical data in addition to the systems placed for commercial use.\nThe success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, pricing, competition, market and consumer acceptance, the effective forecasting and management of product demand, inventory levels, the management of manufacturing and supply costs, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nProcedures\nPrior to the spread of COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced procedure growth trends consistent with those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019, including strength in general surgery, growth in mature procedures in the U.S., and growth in OUS urology. Beginning in January 2020, we saw a substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures in China and, by early February 2020, procedures per week in China had declined by approximately 90% compared to the weekly procedure rates experienced in early January 2020. As the COVID-19 pandemic subsided in China in March 2020, da Vinci procedure volume began to recover and, by the end of the first quarter of 2020, China procedures per week were approximately 70% of the early January 2020 weekly procedure rate. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Western Europe and the U.S., we experienced a significant decline in da Vinci procedures in the last half of March 2020, and procedures per week in the U.S. declined to approximately 65% of the weekly procedure rate experienced earlier in the first quarter of 2020.\nIn April 2020, procedures per week in the U.S. continued to decline, reaching approximately 30% of pre-COVID-19 levels. In May and June, U.S. procedures began a recovery phase, as COVID-19 cases dropped and elective procedures were permitted, and, by the middle of June, had grown to nearly the same level as that measured in the first two weeks of the first quarter of 2020. However, in the last two weeks of June and into July, with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, some regions postponed elective procedures, and we experienced a corresponding decline in da Vinci procedures. The impact of COVID-19 in Europe during the second quarter varied by country with procedures in Italy, France, and the UK declining more steeply, while Germany experienced a year-over-year increase in procedures. During the second quarter of 2020, China procedures per week continued to increase to a level consistent with the early January 2020 weekly procedure rate.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, procedures recovered slowly in the U.S., leveling off near pre-COVID-19 levels towards the end of the quarter. Outside of the U.S., da Vinci procedures varied in the third quarter of 2020, depending on the spread and/or resurgence of COVID-19. For example, COVID-19 had a less significant impact in Germany where da Vinci procedures grew at mid-single digits relative to the third quarter of 2019, while it had a more significant impact in the U.K. where da Vinci procedures declined year over year. Procedures in China grew significantly year over year in the third quarter of 2020, while regional COVID-19 outbreaks resulted in year-over-year procedure growth rates in Japan slowing somewhat relative to earlier in the year. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected the volumes of certain procedure types differently. For example, patient concerns over exposure to COVID-19 and the fact that prostate cancer can be slow growing, combined with lower prostate diagnoses and treatments, have caused the number of dVP procedures to decline in the third quarter of 2020 relative to the third quarter of 2019. Da Vinci bariatric procedures grew significantly year over year in the third quarter of 2020 due to our optimized instrument set and focus by our sales organization and may also have benefited from certain patients prioritizing weight loss as obesity is a significant COVID-19 risk factor. However, the diagnoses and treatment pathways for bariatric patients are long, and many of the patients in the third quarter may have begun their treatment pathway prior to the spread of COVID-19; therefore, we cannot assure you that we will continue to see significant growth in bariatric procedures.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, procedure volumes continued to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare systems around the world diverted resources to respond to the pandemic. The impact continued to differ significantly by geography and region, depending on the spread and resurgence of COVID-19. In the U.S., while procedures continued to recover in the early part of the quarter, the resurgence of COVID-19 infections experienced by some states had an increasingly adverse impact on our procedure volumes as the quarter progressed, a trend that continued into January. The impact of a resurgence in a particular region can be significant. Outside of the U.S., similar to the trends noted in the third quarter, procedures also continued to vary significantly by geography and region. The resurgence of COVID-19 had a more significant impact on procedures in Italy, France, and the UK. Procedures in China continued to grow significantly year over year. The trends that were noted in the third quarter of 2020 in relation to types of procedures, such as dVP and bariatric procedures, continued into the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe continue to see that the impact of COVID-19 on our procedure volumes varies widely by country, region, and type. When COVID-19 infection rates spike in a particular region, procedure volumes have been negatively impacted and the diagnoses of new conditions and their related treatments are deferred. Also, based on our experience during 2020, we do not expect all markets, regions, and procedure types to recover at the same pace. Due to the uncertainty of the recovery, including the potential for COVID-19 infection rates to increase, the extent and period of time over which the COVID-19 pandemic and any resultant economic recession will impact hospital spending, and additional policy responses that may be outlined by governments and other authorities, we cannot reliably estimate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on procedure volume in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond.\nSystem Demand\nAs the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic progressed throughout 2020, customers in affected regions deferred decisions to purchase or lease systems into future quarters and, in some cases, indefinitely. These deferral decisions continued into the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the year-over-year stagnation in procedures and, in turn, reduced utilization of our systems has resulted in unused capacity in the existing installed base. We expect hospitals to first fill their unused capacity before purchasing additional systems. The depth and extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact individual markets will vary based on the availability of testing capabilities, personal protective equipment, intensive care units and operating rooms, and medical staff, as well as government interventions. As COVID-19 continues to disrupt healthcare operations and patient flow, we expect that system placements will lag behind the recovery of da Vinci procedure volume. While we cannot reliably estimate the extent or period of time over which the COVID-19 pandemic and any resultant economic recession will impact hospital spending, we anticipate lower year-over-year system placements for the first quarter of 2021.\nCustomer Relief Program\nIn April 2020, we announced a program to provide financial relief to our customers. The program was comprised of three main elements. The first element provided credits against service fees otherwise due in the six-month period from April 1 through September 30, 2020, that generally reflected the underutilization of the system during that period. Those credits were offered to most customers worldwide. The second element of the program deferred certain lease payments, and the third element extended certain payment terms. Service fee credits resulted in an $80 million decrease in service revenue in 2020. While the short-term payment relief offered did not have a material impact to the results of operations, we deferred $15 million of lease billings and extended payment terms associated with $181 million of trade receivables since the start of the program, of which $19 million remain outstanding as of December 31, 2020. We may be subject to increased credit risks resulting in collection delinquencies and defaults, which could materially impact our bad debt write-offs and provisions for credit losses. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risks, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing credit risks relating to these lease financing arrangements and extended payment terms.\nGeneral Increase in Risks\nCapital markets and worldwide economies have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that it could cause a prolonged recession in local and/or global economies. Such an economic recession could have a material adverse effect on our long-term business as hospitals curtail and reduce capital and overall spending. The COVID-19 pandemic and local actions, such as \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and restrictions on our ability to travel and access our customers or temporary closures of our facilities, including our manufacturing operations, or the facilities of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers, could further significantly impact our sales and our ability to produce and ship our products and supply our customers. Any of these events could negatively impact the number of da Vinci procedures performed or the number of system placements and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur Response\nOur priorities and actions during the COVID-19 pandemic are as follows. First, we are focused on the health and safety of all those we serve - patients, customers, our communities, and our employees - implementing continuous updates to our health and safety policies and processes. Second, we are supporting our customers according to their priorities - clinical, operational, and economic - and ensuring continuity of supply by working with our suppliers and our distributors. Third, we are securing our workforce economically. We have built a valuable team over the years, and we believe they will be important in the recovery that follows the pandemic. Finally, we will continue to invest in our priority development programs while eliminating avoidable spend.\nBusiness Model\nOverview\nWe generate revenue from the placements of da Vinci Surgical Systems, in sales or sales-type lease arrangements where revenue is recognized up-front or in operating lease transactions and usage-based models where revenue is recognized over time. We earn recurring revenue from the sales of instruments, accessories, and services, as well as the revenue from operating leases. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for between $0.5 million and $2.5 million, depending upon the model, configuration, and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers when purchased. Our instruments and accessories have limited lives and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they need to be replaced. We generally earn between $600 and $3,500 of instruments and accessories revenue per surgical procedure performed, depending on the type and complexity of the specific procedures performed and the number and type of instruments used. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we launched our Extended Use Program (refer to further discussion immediately below) with the intention to reduce the cost for customers to treat patients, which in turn will reduce our overall instruments and\naccessories revenue per procedure. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold or leased at an annual fee between $80,000 and $190,000, depending upon the configuration of the underlying system and composition of the services offered under the contract. These service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods.\nWe generate revenue from the placements of the Ion endoluminal system in a business model consistent with the da Vinci Surgical System model described above. We generate revenue from the placement of Ion systems, and we earn recurring revenue from the sales of instruments and accessories used in biopsies and ongoing system service. The average selling price of an Ion system is generally significantly lower than the average selling price of our da Vinci Surgical Systems. We are introducing the Ion system in the U.S. in a measured fashion. For the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, the associated impact to revenue and gross margin was not significant.\nExtended Use Program\nIn 2020, we introduced our \"Extended Use Program,\" which consists of select da Vinci Xi and da Vinci X instruments possessing 12 to 18 uses (\"Extended Use Instruments\") compared to the current 10 use instruments. These Extended Use Instruments represent some of our higher volume instruments but exclude stapling, monopolar, and advanced energy instruments. Instruments included in the program are used across a number of da Vinci surgeries. Their increased uses are the result of continuous, significant investments in the design and production capabilities of our instruments, resulting in improved quality and durability. Extended Use Instruments have been introduced in the U.S. in October 2020 and in Europe in November 2020. They will be introduced at various times throughout 2021 and 2022 in other geographies, depending on regulatory processes. In addition, simultaneous with the regional launches of Extended Use Instruments, we will lower the price of certain instruments that are most commonly used in lower acuity procedures and/or lower reimbursed procedures within the region. These actions will reduce the cost for customers to treat patients, which in turn will reduce our revenue per procedure. Based on 2019 volume and mix of procedures, our Extended Use Program and the reduced pricing on certain other instruments would have reduced 2019 annual instruments and accessories revenue by approximately $150 to $170 million. The impact of these actions on future revenue will be dependent on the future volume and mix of procedures and whether cost elasticity will enable greater penetration into available markets.\nRecurring Revenue\nRecurring revenue consists of instruments and accessories revenue, service revenue, and operating lease revenue. Recurring revenue increased to $3.4 billion, or 77% of total revenue in 2020, compared to $3.2 billion, or 72% of total revenue in 2019, and $2.6 billion, or 71% of total revenue in 2018.\nInstruments and accessories revenue has grown at a faster rate than systems revenue over time. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $2.46 billion in 2020, compared to $2.41 billion in 2019 and $1.96 billion in 2018. The growth of instruments and accessories revenue largely reflects continued procedure adoption.\nService revenue was $724 million in 2020, compared to $724 million in 2019 and $635 million in 2018. Service revenue remained unchanged, driven by the growth of the base of installed da Vinci Surgical Systems, offset by the effects of the Customer Relief Program. The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems grew 7% to approximately 5,989 at December 31, 2020; 12% to approximately 5,582 at December 31, 2019; and 13% to approximately 4,986 at December 31, 2018.\nWe use the installed base, number of shipments, and utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems as metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes that the installed base, number of shipments, and utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance, as management believes that the installed base, number of shipments, and utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems are an indicator of the rate of adoption of robotic-assisted surgery as well as an indicator of future recurring revenue (particularly service revenue). Management believes that both it and investors benefit from referring to the installed base, number of shipments, and utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. The installed base, number of shipments, and utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons of our historical performance. We believe that the installed base, number of shipments, and utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems are useful to investors as metrics, because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business. The vast majority of da Vinci Surgical Systems installed are connected via the internet. System logs can also be accessed by field engineers for systems that are not connected to the internet. We utilize this information as well as other information from agreements and discussions with our customers that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial uncertainties and assumptions. Estimates and judgments for determining the installed base, number of shipments, and utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems may be impacted over time by various factors, including system internet connectivity, hospital and distributor reporting behavior, and inherent complexities in new agreements. Such estimates and judgments are also susceptible to technical errors. In addition, the relationship between the installed base, number of shipments,\nand utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems and our revenues may fluctuate from period to period, and growth in the installed base, number of shipments, and utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems may not correspond to an increase in revenue. The installed base, number of shipments, and utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, revenue or other financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of shipments of da Vinci Surgical Systems in 2020 as compared to the prior year. Based on the factors outlined in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above, historical system shipment trends may not be a good indicator of future system shipments.\nIntuitive System Leasing\nSince 2013, we have entered into sales-type and operating lease arrangements directly with certain qualified customers as a way to offer customers flexibility in how they acquire systems and expand their robotic-assisted programs while leveraging our balance sheet. These leases generally have commercially competitive terms as compared with other third-party entities that offer equipment leasing. We have also entered into usage-based arrangements with larger customers that have committed da Vinci programs where we charge for the system and service as the systems are utilized. We include operating and sales-type leases, and systems placed under usage-based arrangements, in our system shipment and installed base disclosures. We exclude operating lease-related revenue, usage-based revenue, and Ion system revenue from our da Vinci Surgical System average selling price (\u201cASP\u201d) computations.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we shipped 432, 425, and 272 da Vinci Surgical Systems, respectively, under lease and usage-based arrangements, of which 317, 384, and 229 systems, respectively, were operating lease and usage-based arrangements. Revenue from operating lease arrangements is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. More recently, we have entered into usage-based arrangements with certain large customers whereby system and service revenue is recognized as the systems are used. We set operating lease and usage-based pricing at a modest premium relative to purchased systems reflecting the time value of money and, in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risk that system utilization may fall short of anticipated levels. The proportion of revenue recognized from usage-based arrangements has not been significant and has been included in our operating lease metrics herein. Operating lease revenue has grown at a faster rate than overall systems revenue and was $177 million, $107 million, and $51 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Generally, lease transactions generate similar gross margins as our sale transactions. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 901 da Vinci Surgical Systems were installed at customers under operating lease or usage-based arrangements.\nOur system leasing and usage-based models provide customers with flexibility regarding how they acquire or obtain access to our systems. We believe that these alternative financing structures have been effective and well-received, and we are willing to expand the proportion of these structures based on customer demand. As revenue for operating leases and usage-based systems is recognized over time, total systems revenue growth is reduced in a period when the number of operating lease and usage-based placements increases as a proportion of total system placements.\nOur exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty, or other customer-specific factors. In addition, as customers divert significant resources to the treatment of or the preparation to treat patients with COVID-19, we may be exposed to defaults under our lease financing arrangements. Moreover, usage-based arrangements generally contain no minimum payments; therefore, customers may exit such arrangements without paying a financial penalty to us. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipate that some customers will exit such arrangements or seek to amend the terms of our operating lease and usage-based arrangements with them.\nFor some operating lease arrangements, our customers are provided with the right to purchase the leased system at certain points during and/or at the end of the lease term. Revenue generated from customer purchases of systems under operating lease arrangements (\u201cLease Buyouts\u201d) was $52.2 million, $92.8 million, and $48.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We expect that revenue recognized from customer exercises of the buyout options will fluctuate based on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise their buyout options.\nSystems Revenue\nSystem placements are driven by procedure growth in most markets. In geographies where da Vinci procedure adoption is in an early stage or system placements are constrained by regulation, system sales will precede procedure growth. System placements also vary due to seasonality largely aligned with hospital budgeting cycles. We typically place a higher proportion of annual system placements in the fourth quarter and a lower proportion in the first quarter as customer budgets are reset. Systems revenue is also affected by the proportion of system placements under operating lease and usage-based arrangements, recurring operating lease and usage-based revenue, operating lease buyouts, product mix, ASPs, trade-in activities, and customer mix. Systems revenue declined 12% to $1.18 billion in 2020. Systems revenue grew 19% to $1.35 billion in 2019 and 21% to $1.13 billion in 2018. Based on the factors outlined in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above, the ability to forecast\nfuture system shipments has been significantly disrupted and, therefore, we believe that historical system shipment trends may not be a good indicator of future system shipments.\nProcedure Mix / Products\nOur da Vinci Surgical Systems are generally used for soft tissue surgery for areas of the body between the pelvis and the neck, primarily in general surgery, gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. Within these categories, procedures range in complexity from cancer and other highly complex procedures to less complex procedures for benign conditions. Cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions. Thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex, benign conditions. Our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions across the spectrum of procedure complexity. Our fully featured da Vinci Xi Surgical System with advanced instruments (including da Vinci Energy and EndoWrist and SureForm Stapler products) and our Integrated Table Motion product targets the more complex procedure segment. Our da Vinci X Surgical System is targeted towards price sensitive markets and procedures. Our da Vinci SP Surgical System complements the da Vinci Xi and X Surgical Systems by enabling surgeons to access narrow workspaces.\nProcedure Seasonality\nMore than half of da Vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions, most notably hernia repairs, hysterectomies, and cholecystectomies. These benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer operations and surgeries for other life-threatening conditions. Seasonality in the U.S. for procedures for benign conditions typically results in higher fourth quarter procedure volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside the U.S. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods. As a result of the factors outlined in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above, including the recommendations of authorities to defer elective procedures, historical procedure patterns may be disrupted.\nDistribution Channels\nWe provide our products through direct sales organizations in the U.S., Europe (excluding Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and most Eastern European countries), China, Japan, South Korea, India, and Taiwan. In 2018, we began direct operations in India and Taiwan. In January 2019, our Intuitive-Fosun joint venture began direct sales for da Vinci products and services in China. In the remainder of our OUS markets, we provide our products through distributors.\nRegulatory Activities\nOverview\nOur products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards that govern the product safety, efficacy, advertising, labeling, safety reporting design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. Examples of such standards include electrical safety standards, such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission, and composition standards, such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance to such standards.\nOur products and operations are also subject to increasingly stringent medical device, privacy, and other regulations by regional, federal, state, and local authorities. We anticipate that timelines for the introduction of new products and/or indications may be extended relative to past experience as a result of these regulations. For example, we have seen elongated regulatory approval timelines in the U.S. and the EU.\nClearances and Approvals\nWe have generally obtained the clearances required to market our products associated with our da Vinci Surgical Multiport Systems (Standard, S, Si, Xi, and X systems) for our targeted surgical specialties within the U.S., South Korea, Japan, and the European markets in which we operate. Since 2018, we obtained regulatory clearances for the following products:\n\u2022In November 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our SynchroSeal instrument and E-100 generator. Following the FDA clearance, in February 2020, we received CE mark clearance for both products. In March 2020, we received regulatory clearance in Japan to market both our SynchroSeal instrument and E-100 generator. In August 2020, we received regulatory clearance in South Korea to market our E-100 generator.\n\u2022In July 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our SureForm 45 Curved-Tip stapler and SureForm 45 Gray reload, which round out our SureForm 45 portfolio. We have also received CE mark clearance for our SureForm 45 Curved-Tip stapler and SureForm 45 Gray reload.\n\u2022In June 2019, we received CE mark clearance for our da Vinci Endoscope Plus for the da Vinci Xi and da Vinci X Surgical Systems in Europe. Following the CE mark, in July 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our da Vinci Endoscope Plus. We have also received regulatory clearances in South Korea and Japan to market our da Vinci Endoscope Plus in December 2019 and May 2020, respectively.\n\u2022In June 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our da Vinci Handheld Camera and, in February 2020, we received CE mark clearance.\n\u2022In February 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our Ion endoluminal system, our new flexible, robotic-assisted, catheter-based platform, designed to navigate through very small lung airways to reach peripheral nodules for biopsies. We are introducing the Ion endoluminal system in a measured fashion while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain and collect additional clinical data. We have placed 36 Ion systems for commercial use as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022In February 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our Iris augmented reality product. Iris is a service that delivers a 3D image of the patient anatomy (initially targeting kidneys) to aid surgeons in both pre- and intra-operative settings. We are currently conducting a pilot study of our Iris product and service in the field at a small group of U.S. hospitals to gain initial product experience and insights.\n\u2022In December 2018, we received product registration for our da Vinci Xi Surgical System in China. The registration approval does not include advanced energy or stapling products that attach to the da Vinci Xi system. Separate product registrations are required for each of these products by China National Medical Products Administration (\u201cNMPA\u201d).\n\u2022In October 2018, the China National Health Commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in China through 2020. After an adjustment notice was published in the third quarter of 2020, the government will now allow for the total sale of 225 new surgical robots into China, which could include da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. As of December 31, 2020, we have sold 111 da Vinci Surgical Systems under this quota. Future sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems under the quota are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals.\n\u2022In May 2018 and July 2018, we received CE mark clearance and FDA clearance, respectively, to market SureForm 60, our first 60mm stapler that completes our product offering of 30, 45, and 60mm lengths. In January 2019 and February 2019, we obtained FDA clearance and CE mark clearance, respectively, to market SureForm 45. We have also received regulatory clearance in South Korea and Japan to market both SureForm 60 and SureForm 45.\n\u2022In May 2018, we obtained FDA clearance for the da Vinci SP Surgical System for urologic surgical procedures that are appropriate for a single port approach. In March 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for the da Vinci SP Surgical System for certain transoral procedures. We also received regulatory clearance for the da Vinci SP Surgical System in South Korea in May 2018. We continue to introduce the da Vinci SP Surgical System in a measured fashion while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain. We have an installed base of 69 da Vinci SP Surgical Systems as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022In September 2017 and April 2018, we obtained CE mark clearance and FDA clearance, respectively, for our da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend.\nRefer to the descriptions of our products that received regulatory clearances in 2020, 2019, and 2018 in the New Product Introductions section below.\nThe Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (\u201cMHLW\u201d) considers reimbursement for procedures in April of even-numbered years. The process for obtaining reimbursement requires Japanese university hospitals and surgical societies, with our support, to seek reimbursement. There are multiple pathways to obtain reimbursement for procedures, including those that require in-country clinical data/economic data. In April 2012 and April 2016, the MHLW granted reimbursement status for dVP and partial nephrectomy, respectively. Most prostatectomies and partial nephrectomies were open procedures prior to da Vinci reimbursement. Da Vinci procedure reimbursement for dVP and partial nephrectomy procedures are higher than open and conventional laparoscopic procedure reimbursements. An additional 12 da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. An additional 7 da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective April 1, 2020. These additional 19 reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional, laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these 19 procedures, there can be no assurance that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to dVP or partial nephrectomy, given their higher reimbursement, or any other da Vinci procedure.\nRecalls and Corrections\nMedical device companies have regulatory obligations to correct or remove medical devices in the field that could pose a risk to health. The definition of \u201crecalls and corrections\u201d is expansive and includes repair, replacement, inspections, relabeling, and issuance of new or additional instructions for use or reinforcement of existing instructions for use and training when such\nactions are taken for specific reasons of safety or compliance. These field actions require stringent documentation, reporting, and monitoring worldwide. There are other actions that a medical device manufacturer may take in the field without reporting including, but not limited to, routine servicing and stock rotations.\nAs we determine whether a field action is reportable in any regulatory jurisdiction, we prepare and submit notifications to the appropriate regulatory agency for the particular jurisdiction. Regulators can require the expansion, reclassification, or change in scope and language of the field action. In general, upon submitting required notifications to regulators regarding a field action that is a recall or correction, we will notify customers regarding the field action, provide any additional documentation required in their national language, and arrange, as required, return or replacement of the affected product or a field service visit to perform the correction.\nField actions as well as certain outcomes from regulatory activities can result in adverse effects on our business, including damage to our reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of the use of installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses.\nProcedures\nWe model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. In this equation, procedure efficacy is defined as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is defined as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. When the patient value of a da Vinci procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options, patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons and hospitals that offer da Vinci Surgery, which could potentially result in a local market share shift. Adoption of da Vinci procedures occurs procedure by procedure and market by market and is driven by the relative patient value and total treatment costs of da Vinci procedures as compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state or condition.\nWe use the number and type of da Vinci procedures as metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes that the number and type of da Vinci procedures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance, as management believes procedure volume is an indicator of the rate of adoption of robotic-assisted surgery as well as an indicator of future revenue (including revenue from usage-based arrangements). Management believes that both it and investors benefit from referring to the number and type of da Vinci procedures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. The number and type of da Vinci procedures also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons of our historical performance. We believe that the number and type of da Vinci procedures are useful to investors as metrics, because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business. The vast majority of da Vinci Surgical Systems installed are connected via the internet. System logs can also be accessed by field engineers for systems that are not connected to the internet. We utilize certain methods that rely on information collected from the systems installed for determining the number and type of da Vinci procedures performed that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial uncertainties and assumptions. Estimates and judgments for determining the number and type of da Vinci procedures may be impacted over time by various factors, including changes in treatment modalities, hospital and distributor reporting behavior, and system internet connectivity. Such estimates and judgments are also susceptible to algorithmic or other technical errors. In addition, the relationship between the number and type of da Vinci procedures and our revenues may fluctuate from period to period, and da Vinci procedure volume growth may not correspond to an increase in revenue. The number and type of da Vinci procedures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, revenue or other financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of da Vinci procedures performed by our customers in the first three quarters of 2020 as compared to our expectations. Based on the factors outlined in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above, the ability to forecast future procedures based on historical procedure patterns has been disrupted. Therefore, we believe that historical procedure trends may not be a good indicator of future procedure volumes.\nWorldwide Procedures\nOur da Vinci systems and instruments are regulated independently in various countries and regions of the world. The discussion of indications for use and representative or target procedures is intended solely to provide an understanding of the market for da Vinci products and is not intended to promote for sale or use any Intuitive Surgical product outside of its licensed or cleared labeling and indications for use.\nThe adoption of robotic-assisted surgery using the da Vinci Surgical System has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da Vinci alternatives and competitive total economics for healthcare providers. Our da Vinci Surgical Systems are used primarily in general surgery, gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. We focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training products and services for procedures in which da Vinci can bring patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic\nbenefit to healthcare providers. Target procedures in general surgery include hernia repair (both ventral and inguinal), colorectal procedures, bariatrics, and cholecystectomies. Target procedures in gynecology include da Vinci hysterectomy (\u201cdVH\u201d) for both cancer and benign conditions. Target procedures in urology include da Vinci prostatectomy (\u201cdVP\u201d) and da Vinci partial nephrectomy. In cardiothoracic surgery, target procedures include da Vinci lobectomy. In head and neck surgery, target procedures include certain procedures resecting benign and malignant tumors classified as T1 and T2. Not all the indications, procedures, or products described may be available in a given country or region or on all generations of da Vinci Surgical Systems. Surgeons and their patients need to consult the product labeling in their specific country and for each product in order to determine the cleared uses, as well as important limitations, restrictions, or contraindications.\nIn 2020, approximately 1,243,000 surgical procedures were performed with da Vinci Surgical Systems, compared to approximately 1,229,000 and 1,038,000 surgical procedures performed with da Vinci Surgical Systems in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The reduced growth in our overall procedure volume in 2020 reflects significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above, and was driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and worldwide urology procedures.\nU.S. Procedures\nOverall U.S. procedure volume with da Vinci Surgical Systems grew to approximately 876,000 in 2020, compared to approximately 883,000 in 2019 and approximately 753,000 in 2018. General surgery was our largest and fastest growing U.S. specialty in 2020 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 434,000 in 2020, compared to approximately 421,000 in 2019 and approximately 325,000 in 2018. Gynecology was our second largest U.S. surgical specialty in 2020 with procedure volume that declined to approximately 267,000 in 2020, compared to approximately 282,000 in 2019 and approximately 265,000 in 2018. Urology was our third largest U.S. surgical specialty in 2020 with procedure volume that declined to approximately 134,000 in 2020, compared to approximately 138,000 in 2019 and approximately 128,000 in 2018.\nProcedures Outside of the U.S.\nOverall OUS procedure volume with da Vinci Surgical Systems grew to approximately 367,000 in 2020, compared to approximately 346,000 in 2019 and approximately 285,000 in 2018. Procedure growth in most OUS markets was driven largely by urology procedure volume, which grew to approximately 214,000 in 2020, compared to approximately 206,000 in 2019 and approximately 175,000 in 2018. General surgery and thoracic procedures also contributed to OUS procedure growth with higher growth rates than urology procedures.\nRecent Business Events and Trends\nProcedures\nOverall. Total da Vinci procedures performed by our customers grew approximately 1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 18% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total da Vinci procedures performed by our customers grew approximately 6% for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 19% for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The full year and fourth quarter 2020 procedure results reflect significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our procedures in geographies and markets where there was a resurgence of the virus. Delays in both the diagnosis of and treatments of disease reflecting patient concerns over contracting COVID-19 has also impacted the number of procedures. This was most pronounced in dVP procedures.\nU.S. da Vinci procedures declined approximately 1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year. U.S. da Vinci procedures grew approximately 17% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2020 U.S. procedure results reflect significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. The 2020 U.S. procedure decline was largely attributable to a decline in gynecology procedures, most notably benign dVH procedures, and urology procedures, most notably dVP procedures. Offsetting these declines was continued growth in general surgery procedures, most notably cholecystectomy and bariatric procedures.\nU.S. da Vinci procedures grew approximately 5% for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 18% for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The fourth quarter 2020 U.S. procedure results reflect significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and regional resurgences, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. We saw varied performance in each of the procedure categories during the fourth quarter of 2020, with growth in general surgery and gynecology procedures offset by declines in urology procedures. The resurgence increased as the quarter progressed, and we saw a more severe impact on procedures later in the quarter. The resurgence continued into January, negatively impacting procedure volumes.\nOUS da Vinci procedures grew approximately 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 21% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2020 OUS procedure growth reflects significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. 2020 OUS procedure growth was driven by\ncontinued growth in urologic procedures, including nephrectomies and prostatectomies, and earlier stage growth in general surgery (particularly colorectal), thoracic, and gynecology procedures. We believe growth in these global markets is being driven by increased acceptance among surgeons and health systems, supported by expanded global evidence validating the clinical and economic value of da Vinci procedures.\nOUS da Vinci procedures grew approximately 11% for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 21% for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The fourth quarter 2020 OUS procedure growth reflects significant procedure disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. The disruption was more pronounced in the UK, Italy, France, the Nordics, Spain, and India. COVID-19 disruption was less pronounced in China, Japan, and South Korea, where we experienced procedure growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nU.S. General Surgery. In 2020, general surgery procedures in the U.S. grew to approximately 434,000 in 2020, compared to approximately 421,000 in 2019 and approximately 325,000 in 2018. Cholecystectomy and bariatric procedures contributed to the most incremental procedures in 2020, while inguinal and ventral hernia repairs contributed the most incremental procedures in 2019 and 2018.\nGiven the already very high level of laparoscopic techniques used in cholecystectomy, it is unclear whether growth is sustainable and to what extent da Vinci cholecystectomy may be adopted. Bariatric procedures grew significantly year over year. These procedures have been an increased area of focus in 2020 and may also have benefited from certain patients prioritizing weight loss as obesity is a significant COVID-19 risk factor. In addition, our SureForm 60mm stapler product provides surgeons a more optimized robotic tool set for bariatric procedures. However, the diagnoses and treatment pathways for bariatric patients are long, and many of the patients may have begun their treatment pathway prior to the spread of COVID-19; therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to see significant growth in bariatric procedures in future periods.\nWe believe that growth in da Vinci hernia repair reflects improved clinical outcomes within certain patient populations, as well as potential cost benefits relative to certain alternative treatments. We believe hernia repair procedures represent a significant opportunity with the potential to drive growth in future periods. However, given the differences in surgical complexity associated with treatment of various hernia patient populations and varying surgeon opinion regarding optimal surgical technique, it is difficult to estimate the timing of and to what extent da Vinci hernia repair procedure volume will grow in the future. We expect a large portion of hernia repairs will continue to be performed via different modalities of surgery.\nAdoption of da Vinci for colorectal procedures, which includes several underlying procedures including low anterior resections for rectal cancers and certain colon procedures for benign and cancerous conditions, has been ongoing for several years and is supported by our recently launched technologies, such as the EndoWrist Staplers and energy devices and Integrated Table Motion.\nU.S. Gynecology. In 2020, gynecology procedures in the U.S. declined modestly compared to 2019. Procedure volume was approximately 267,000 in 2020, compared to approximately 282,000 in 2019 and approximately 265,000 in 2018, driven by a decline in benign hysterectomy procedures partially offset, to a much lesser extent, by growth in hysterectomy for cancer. Combining robotic, laparoscopic, and vaginal approaches, MIS represents about 80% of the U.S. hysterectomy market for benign conditions. We believe that our growth in gynecologic procedures over the past several years has primarily been driven by consolidation of gynecologic procedures into higher volume surgeons that focus on cancer and complex surgeries. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw an increase in the deferral of non-urgent procedures, such as benign hysterectomy procedures.\nGlobal Urology. Along with U.S. general surgery, global urology procedures have also been a strong contributor to our overall procedure growth. In the U.S., dVP is the standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer, and we believe growth is largely aligned with surgical volumes of prostate cancer. In 2020, U.S. dVP procedures declined modestly, compared to modest growth in 2019. For OUS, dVP is at varying states of adoption in different areas of the world but is the largest overall da Vinci procedure. In 2020, we saw slight growth in OUS dVP procedures compared to mid-teens growth in 2019.\nKidney cancer procedures have also been a strong contributor to our recent global urology procedure growth. Clinical publications have demonstrated that the use of a da Vinci system increases the likelihood that a patient will receive nephron sparing surgery through a partial nephrectomy, which is typically the surgical society guideline recommended therapy.\nOUS Procedures. The 2020 OUS procedure growth rate reflects continued da Vinci adoption in European and Asian markets, although it also reflects significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. The disruption was most pronounced in the UK, Italy, and France.\nSystem Demand\nFuture demand for da Vinci Surgical Systems will be impacted by a number of factors: economic and geopolitical factors; the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above; hospital response to the evolving healthcare environment; procedure growth rates; hospital consolidation trends; evolving system utilization and point of care dynamics; capital replacement trends; additional reimbursements in various global markets, including Japan; the timing around governmental tenders and authorizations, including China; the timing of when we receive regulatory clearance in our other OUS markets for our da Vinci Xi Surgical System, da Vinci X Surgical System, and da Vinci SP Surgical System, and related instruments; and market response. Market acceptance of our recently launched da Vinci SP Surgical System and the nature and timing of additional da Vinci SP regulatory indications may also impact future system placements.\nDemand may also be impacted by robotic-assisted surgery competition, including from companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field including, but not limited to, the following companies: avateramedical GmbH; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson (including their wholly owned subsidiaries Auris Health, Inc. and Verb Surgical Inc.); Medicaroid, Inc.; Medrobotics Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; MicroPort Scientific Corporation; Olympus Corporation; Samsung Group; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; Smart Robot Technology Group Co. Ltd.; Titan Medical Inc.; and TransEnterix, Inc.\nMany of the above factors will also impact future demand for our Ion system, as we extend our commercial offering into diagnostics, along with additional factors associated with a new product introduction, including, but not limited to, our ability to optimize manufacturing and our supply chain, competition, clinical data to demonstrate value, and market acceptance.\nNew Product Introductions\nSynchroSeal and E-100 Generator. In November 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our SynchroSeal instrument and E-100 generator. Following the FDA clearance, in February 2020, we received CE mark clearance for both products. In March 2020, we received regulatory clearance in Japan to market both our SynchroSeal instrument and E-100 generator. In August 2020, we received regulatory clearance in South Korea to market our E-100 generator. SynchroSeal is a single-use, bipolar, electrosurgical instrument intended for grasping, dissection, sealing, and transection of tissue. With its wristed articulation, rapid sealing cycle, and refined curved jaw, SynchroSeal offers enhanced versatility to the da Vinci Energy portfolio. The E-100 generator is an electrosurgical generator developed to power two key instruments-Vessel Sealer Extend and SynchroSeal-on the da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi Surgical Systems. The generator delivers high frequency energy for cutting, coagulation, and vessel sealing of tissues.\nSureForm 45 Curved-Tip and Gray Reload. In July 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for the SureForm 45 Curved-Tip stapler and SureForm 45 Gray reload. We have also received CE mark clearance for our SureForm 45 Curved-Tip stapler and SureForm 45 Gray reload. SureForm 45 Curved-Tip is a single-use, fully wristed stapling instrument with a curved tip intended for resection, transection, and/or creation of anastomoses. SureForm 45 Gray reload is a new, single-use cartridge that contains multiple staggered rows of implantable staples and a stainless steel knife. The SureForm 45 Curved-Tip stapler and Gray reload have particular utility in thoracic procedures and round out our SureForm 45 portfolio. Not all reloads or staplers are available for use on all systems or in all countries.\nDa Vinci Endoscope Plus. In June 2019, we received CE mark clearance for our da Vinci Endoscope Plus, an enhanced 3D endoscope for use with our da Vinci X and Xi Surgical Systems. Following the CE mark, in July 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our da Vinci Endoscope Plus. We have also received regulatory clearances in South Korea and Japan to market our da Vinci Endoscope Plus in December 2019 and May 2020, respectively. The da Vinci Endoscope Plus leverages new sensor technology to allow for increased sharpness and color accuracy.\nDa Vinci Handheld Camera. In June 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our da Vinci Handheld Camera, a lightweight, 2D camera head, which can be connected to third-party laparoscopes. This allows the laparoscopic image to be displayed on the da Vinci X/Xi vision cart to address aspects of da Vinci procedures that may require use of a laparoscope, thus eliminating the need for redundant equipment in the operating room and increasing procedure efficiency. In February 2020, we received CE mark clearance for our da Vinci Handheld Camera. We broadly launched the da Vinci Handheld Camera in our European direct markets as well as in the U.S. in May 2020 and June 2020, respectively.\nIon endoluminal system. In February 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for the Ion endoluminal system, our new flexible, robotic-assisted, catheter-based platform designed to navigate through very small lung airways to reach peripheral nodules for biopsies. The Ion system uses an ultra-thin articulating robotic catheter that can articulate 180 degrees in all directions. The outer diameter of the catheter is 3.5mm, which allows physicians to navigate through small and tortuous airways to reach nodules in most airway segments within the lung. The Ion system\u2019s flexible biopsy needle can also pass through very tight bends via Ion\u2019s catheter to collect tissue in the peripheral lung. The catheter\u2019s 2mm working channel can also accommodate other biopsy tools, such as biopsy forceps or cytology brushes, if necessary. We are introducing Ion in a measured fashion\nwhile we optimize training pathways and our supply chain and collect additional clinical data. We have placed 36 Ion systems for commercial use as of December 31, 2020.\nIris. In February 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for our Iris augmented reality product. Iris is a service that delivers a 3D image of the patient anatomy (initially targeting kidneys) to aid surgeons in both the pre- and intra-operative settings. We are now in the early stages of an Iris pilot study in the field at a small group of U.S. hospitals to gain initial product experience and insights.\nSureForm 60 and SureForm 45 Staplers. In May 2018 and July 2018, we received CE mark clearance and FDA clearance, respectively, for the SureForm 60 instrument with White, Blue, Green, and Black 60mm reloads. In January 2019 and February 2019, we obtained FDA clearance and CE mark clearance, respectively, for the SureForm 45 instrument with White, Blue, Green, and Black 45mm reloads. Additionally, we received regulatory clearance in South Korea for the SureForm 60 instrument and 60mm reloads in June 2018 and July 2018, respectively, and for the SureForm 45 instrument and 45mm reloads in June 2019 and September 2019, respectively. Also, we received regulatory clearance in Japan for the SureForm 60 instrument and 60mm reloads in June 2018 and November 2018, respectively, and for the SureForm 45 instrument and 45mm reloads in September 2019. The SureForm 60 and SureForm 45 Staplers are single-use, fully wristed stapling instruments intended for resection, transection, and/or creation of anastomoses. The SureForm 60 instrument has particular utility in bariatric procedures, while the SureForm 45 instrument has particular utility in colorectal procedures. SureForm 60 and SureForm 45 Staplers broaden our existing stapler product line, which also includes EndoWrist Stapler 45 with White, Blue, and Green 45mm reloads and EndoWrist Stapler 30 with Gray, White, Blue, and Green 30mm reloads. Not all reloads or staplers are available for use on all systems or in all countries.\nDa Vinci SP Surgical System. In May 2018, we obtained FDA clearance for the da Vinci SP Surgical System for urologic surgical procedures that are appropriate for a single port approach. In March 2019, we obtained FDA clearance for the da Vinci SP Surgical System for certain transoral procedures. The da Vinci SP Surgical System includes three, multi-jointed, wristed instruments and the first da Vinci fully wristed, 3DHD camera. The instruments and the camera all emerge through a single cannula and are triangulated around the target anatomy to avoid external instrument collisions that can occur in narrow surgical workspaces. The system enables flexible port placement and broad internal and external range of motion (e.g., 360 degrees of anatomical access) through the single SP arm. Surgeons control the fully articulating instruments and the camera on the da Vinci SP system, which uses the same fourth generation surgeon console as the da Vinci X and Xi systems. The da Vinci SP Surgical System provides surgeons with robotic-assisted technology designed for deep and narrow access to tissue in the body. We anticipate pursuing further regulatory clearances for the da Vinci SP Surgical System, including colorectal applications, broadening the applicability of the SP platform over time. We continue to introduce the da Vinci SP Surgical System in a measured fashion while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain. We have an installed base of 69 da Vinci SP Surgical Systems as of December 31, 2020.\nDa Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend. In September 2017 and April 2018, we received CE mark clearance and FDA clearance, respectively, for da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend, our newest instrument in the Vessel Sealing family of products. Da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend is a single-use, fully wristed bipolar electrosurgical instrument compatible with our fourth generation multiport systems. It is intended for grasping and blunt dissection of tissue and for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to 7mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument.\nAcquisition of Orpheus Medical\nIn February 2020, we acquired Orpheus Medical Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries to deepen and expand our integrated informatics platform. Orpheus Medical provides hospitals with information technology connectivity, as well as expertise in processing and archiving surgical videos. Orpheus Medical is a wholly owned subsidiary of Intuitive.\nIntuitive Ventures\nWe launched Intuitive Ventures, an inaugural $100 million fund focused on investment opportunities in companies that share Intuitive's commitment to advancing positive outcomes in healthcare.\n2020 Operational and Financial Highlights\n\u2022Total revenue decreased by 3% to $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Approximately 1,243,000 da Vinci procedures were performed during the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 1% compared to approximately 1,229,000 da Vinci procedures for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Instruments and accessories revenue increased by 2% to $2.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.41 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Systems revenue decreased by 12% to $1.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.35 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022A total of 936 da Vinci Surgical Systems were shipped during the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 16% compared to 1,119 systems during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of approximately 5,989 systems, an increase of 7% compared to the installed base of approximately 5,582 systems as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Utilization of da Vinci Surgical Systems, measured in terms of procedures per system per year, declined 2% relative to 2019.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2020, we placed 26 Ion systems for commercial use, compared to 10 Ion systems during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 69.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Operating income decreased by 24% to $1.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating income included $399 million and $338 million of share-based compensation expense related to employee stock plans and $60.9 million and $67.2 million of intangible asset-related charges for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, we had $6.87 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $1.02 billion, compared to $5.85 billion in December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by capital expenditures.\nResults of Operations\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years indicated, certain Consolidated Statements of Income information (in millions, except percentages):\nTotal Revenue\nTotal revenue decreased by 3% to $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by 20% compared to $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulted from 12% lower systems revenue, driven by 16% fewer system placements partially offset by a 65% increase in operating lease revenue, and 2% higher instruments and accessories revenue, driven by approximately 1% higher procedure volume. Service revenue was consistent year over year, driven by a larger installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing service revenue, offset by an $80 million decrease as a result of the service fee credits provided to customers as part of our Customer Relief Program.\nRevenue denominated in foreign currencies as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 23%, 20%, and 20% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We generally sell our products and services in local currencies where we have direct distribution channels. Foreign currency rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019, or for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018.\nRevenue generated in the U.S. accounted for 68%, 70%, and 71% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We believe that U.S. revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue due to U.S. patients\u2019 ability to choose their provider and method of treatment, reimbursement structures supportive of innovation and MIS,\nand our initial investments focused on U.S. infrastructure. We have been investing in our business in the OUS markets, and our OUS procedures have grown faster in proportion to U.S. procedures. We expect that our OUS procedures and revenue will make up a greater portion of our business in the long term. However, the current increase in OUS revenue as a percentage of total revenue is a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and is reflective that U.S. procedures and revenue were more impacted than OUS procedures and revenue.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to cause strain on hospital resources, as outlined in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above, including recommended deferrals of elective procedures by various authorities and policy makers, we cannot reliably estimate the extent procedures and system placements will be impacted in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond.\nThe following table summarizes our revenue and system unit shipments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively (in millions, except percentages and unit shipments):\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue decreased by 3% to $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by 22% compared to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInstruments and accessories revenue increased by 2% to $2.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.41 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in instruments and accessories revenue was driven primarily by procedure growth of 1%, stocking orders in Q4 associated with the Company's launch of Extended Use Instruments, and\nincremental sales of our advanced instruments. The 2020 U.S. procedure volumes declined by approximately 1%, primarily as a result of the significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above, compared to 2019 U.S. procedure growth of 17%. The 2020 OUS procedure volumes grew by approximately 6%, compared to 2019 OUS procedure growth of 21%, also driven by the significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in the COVID-19 Pandemic section above. Geographically, the 2020 OUS procedure growth was driven by China, Japan, Korea, and Germany with varying results in other countries.\nSystems revenue decreased by 12% to $1.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.35 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower 2020 systems revenue was primarily driven by fewer system shipments, lower 2020 ASPs, and lower lease buyouts, partially offset by higher operating lease revenue.\nDuring 2020, a total of 936 da Vinci Surgical Systems were shipped compared to 1,119 systems during 2019. By geography, 600 systems were shipped into the U.S., 136 into Europe, 157 into Asia, and 43 into other markets during 2020, compared to 728 systems shipped into the U.S., 169 into Europe, 182 into Asia, and 40 into other markets during 2019. During 2020, 317 of the 936 systems were shipped under operating lease arrangements, compared to 384 of the 1,119 systems shipped during 2019. The decrease in system shipments was primarily driven by decisions by customers to defer purchases or leases of systems into future quarters and, in some cases, indefinitely, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the decline in procedures, which lead to excess capacity at certain hospitals.\nWe shipped 432 and 425 da Vinci Surgical Systems under lease or usage-based arrangements, of which 317 and 384 systems were classified as operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Operating lease revenue was $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $107 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Systems placed as operating leases represented 34% of total shipments during 2020, compared to 34% during 2019. A total of 901 da Vinci Surgical Systems were installed at customers under operating lease or usage-based arrangements as of December 31, 2020, compared to 658 as of December 31, 2019. Revenue from Lease Buyouts was $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect revenue from Lease Buyouts to fluctuate period to period based on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise the buyout options embedded in their leases.\nThe da Vinci Surgical System ASP, excluding the impact of systems shipped under operating lease or usage-based arrangements and Ion systems, was approximately $1.50 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately $1.52 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower 2020 ASP was largely driven by higher relative trade-in volume, partially offset by favorable geographic and product mix. ASP fluctuates from period to period based on geographic and product mix, product pricing, systems shipped involving trade-ins, and changes in foreign exchange rates.\nService Revenue\nService revenue remained unchanged at $724 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $724 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by 14% compared to $635 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Service revenue in 2020 was primarily driven by a larger installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing service revenue, offset by an $80 million decrease as a result of the service fee credits provided to customers as part of our Customer Relief Program.\nGross Profit\nProduct gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by 9% to $2.4 billion, representing 66.2% of product revenue, compared to $2.6 billion, representing 70.2% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower 2020 product gross profit was primarily driven by lower product revenue and lower product gross profit margin. The lower product gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily driven by higher excess and obsolete inventory costs related to transitioning to new technologies coupled with the decrease in demand for older technologies, period costs associated with abnormally low production, and higher freight costs. These higher charges were primarily a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There were also increased costs associated with da Vinci Si product transitions and higher intangible assets amortization expense and share-based compensation expense.\nProduct gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, included share-based compensation expense of $58.9 million and $46.6 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $35.5 million and $31.5 million, respectively.\nService gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by 4% to $457 million, representing 63.1% of service revenue, compared to $475 million, representing 65.6% of service revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower 2020 service gross profit was driven by lower service revenue and lower service gross profit margin. The lower service gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily driven by the $80 million decrease in service revenue as a result of our Customer Relief Program.\nService gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, included share-based compensation expense of $24.0 million and $20.4 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $3.7 million and $3.7 million, respectively.\nAs a result of the continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, our production facilities may run at less than normal capacity in the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, certain fixed production overhead costs may be expensed as incurred, reducing our gross profit margin. We cannot reliably estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our overall demand in the first quarter and beyond.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees, and general corporate expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by 3% to $1.22 billion, compared to $1.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, were primarily driven by higher headcount, resulting in increased share-based compensation expense, and increased infrastructure to support our growth, partially offset by lower marketing, travel, and training expenses as well as lower variable compensation. Also, in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, we made charitable contributions of $25 million and $5 million, respectively, to the Intuitive Foundation, a not-for-profit entity whose mission is to reduce the global burden of disease and suffering through research, education, and philanthropy aimed at better outcomes for patients around the globe.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, included share-based compensation expense of $202 million and $170 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $6.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively.\nOur spending in 2020 reflected a curtailment of certain costs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel, marketing events, surgeon training, clinical trials, and other related expenses. We expect that these costs will increase to the extent that the impact of COVID-19 decreases and decline to the extent that the impact of COVID-19 increases. However, we will continue to support our customers, invest in innovation focused on the quadruple aim, and invest in manufacturing and our supply chain to ensure supply for our customers. We will continue to manage the hiring of volume-related roles, such as sales representatives and manufacturing employees, to meet the needs of the business.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, and significant enhancement of our products.\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by 7% to $595 million, compared to $557 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses and other project costs incurred to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including Ion and SP platform investments, informatics, advanced instrumentation, advanced imaging, and future generations of robotics, partially offset by lower intangible asset-related charges.\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, included share-based compensation expense of $114 million and $101 million, respectively, and intangible asset charges of $15.8 million and $26.3 million, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses fluctuate with project timing. Based upon our broader set of product development initiatives and the stage of the underlying projects, we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net, was $157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $127.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest and other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily driven by unrealized gains on strategic investments and realized gains on the sale of certain securities, partially offset by lower interest income earned, despite higher cash and investment balances, due to the decline in average interest rates, and realized foreign exchange losses.\nThe Company held an equity investment in preferred shares of InTouch Technologies, Inc. (\"InTouch\"), which was reflected in the Company's financial statements on a cost basis. On July 1, 2020, Teladoc Health, Inc. (\"Teladoc\"), a publicly traded company, completed its acquisition of InTouch. Based on the terms of the agreement, the Company has received Teladoc shares on the date of closing and recognized a gain on its investment of approximately $45 million. The Company was\nrestricted from selling these shares for a period of six months. In January 2021, the Company sold all of its shares in Teladoc. Additionally, the Company recorded unrealized gains on other strategic investments of approximately $22 million.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur income tax expense was $140 million, $120 million, and $155 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2020 was approximately 11.6% compared to 8.0% for 2019 and 12.1% for 2018. Our effective tax rate for 2020, 2019, and 2018 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the excess tax benefits recognized for employee share-based compensation, the effect of income earned by certain overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, and the federal research and development credit benefit, partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign earnings and state income taxes (net of federal benefit). In addition, our 2020 tax rate reflected a $39.3 million increase in income tax expense discussed below, and our 2019 tax rate reflected a $51.3 million benefit associated with re-measurement of our Swiss deferred tax assets due to a Swiss statutory tax rate increase enacted as part of Swiss tax reform in August 2019.\nOur 2020, 2019, and 2018 provisions for income taxes included excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans of $166 million, $147 million, and $116 million, respectively, which reduced our effective tax rate by 13.8, 9.8, and 9.1 percentage points, respectively. The amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies will fluctuate from period to period based on the price of our stock, the volume of share-based awards settled or vested, and the value assigned to employee equity awards under U.S. GAAP, which results in increased income tax expense volatility.\nWe intend to repatriate earnings from our Swiss subsidiary and our joint venture in Hong Kong, as needed, and the U.S. and foreign tax implications of such repatriations are not expected to be significant. We will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from the rest of our foreign subsidiaries, which are not significant.\nIn July 2015, a U.S. Tax Court opinion (the \u201c2015 Opinion\u201d) was issued involving an independent third party related to charging foreign subsidiaries for share-based compensation. Based on the findings of the U.S. Tax Court, direct share-based compensation had been excluded from our intercompany charges starting in 2015. In June 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (the \"Ninth Circuit\") reversed the 2015 Opinion (the \u201cNinth Circuit Opinion\u201d). Subsequently, a re-hearing of the case was requested, but was denied in November 2019. In February 2020, a petition was filed to appeal the Ninth Circuit Opinion to the U.S. Supreme Court. The petition was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 22, 2020, which makes the Ninth Circuit Opinion binding precedent in the Ninth Circuit. As a result, we recorded an increase in the income tax provision of $39.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. We will continue to monitor future IRS actions or other developments regarding this matter and will assess the impact of any such developments to our income tax provision in the quarter that they occur. We are treating share-based compensation expense in accordance with the Ninth Circuit Opinion for 2020 and future periods.\nWe file federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the U.S. and abroad. Years prior to 2016 are considered closed for most significant jurisdictions. Certain of our unrecognized tax benefits could reverse based on the normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect our effective tax rate in the period in which they reverse.\nWe are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The outcome of these audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Management regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u2019s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Joint Venture\nThe Company\u2019s majority-owned joint venture (the \u201cJoint Venture\u201d) with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (\u201cFosun Pharma\u201d), a subsidiary of Fosun International Limited, was established to research, develop, manufacture, and sell robotic-assisted, catheter-based medical devices. The Joint Venture is owned 60% by us and 40% by Fosun Pharma and is located in China. The catheter-based technology will initially target early diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world. Distribution of catheter-based medical devices in China will be conducted by the joint venture, while distribution outside of China will be conducted by us.\nIn January 2019, the Joint Venture acquired certain assets, including distribution rights, customer relationships, and certain personnel, from Chindex and its affiliates, a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma, and began direct operations for da Vinci products and services in China. As of December 31, 2020, the companies have contributed $55 million of up to $100 million required by the joint venture agreement.\nWe do not expect the Joint Venture to generate revenue in 2021 related to the sale of robotic-assisted, catheter-based medical devices. There can be no assurance that we and the Joint Venture will successfully commercialize such products. There can also be no assurance that the Joint Venture will not require additional contributions to fund its business, that the Joint\nVenture will continue to be profitable, or that the acquired Chindex assets will be successfully integrated and the expected benefits will be realized.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest in Joint Venture for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $6.2 million, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $(2.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in Joint Venture for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to the increase in sales in China, partially offset by re-measurement losses related to the contingent consideration from the acquisition.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and by the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. Cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments increased by $1.02 billion to $6.87 billion as of December 31, 2020, from $5.85 billion as of December 31, 2019, primarily from cash provided by our operations and proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases, partially offset by capital expenditures, taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards, and share repurchases. Cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments increased by $1.02 billion to $5.85 billion as of December 31, 2019, from $4.83 billion as of December 31, 2018, primarily from cash provided by our operations, partially offset by capital expenditures and share repurchases.\nOur cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products, and other factors. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. We have made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities, and intellectual property. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided by our operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to experience reduced cash flow from operations as a result of decreased revenues and extending payment terms on sales and operating lease and usage-based arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $556 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments was held by foreign subsidiaries. We intend to repatriate earnings from our Swiss subsidiary and joint venture in Hong Kong, as needed, since the U.S. and foreign tax implications of such repatriations are not expected to be significant. We will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from the rest of our foreign subsidiaries, which are not significant.\nSee \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for discussion on the impact of interest rate risk and market risk on our investment portfolio.\nConsolidated Cash Flow Data\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.48 billion exceeded our net income of $1.07 billion, primarily due to the following factors:\n1.Our net income included non-cash charges of $691 million, consisting primarily of the following significant items: share-based compensation of $395 million; depreciation expense and losses on the disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $226 million; deferred income taxes of $58 million; gains on investments, accretion, and amortization, net, of $55 million; and amortization of intangible assets of $50 million.\n2.The non-cash charges outlined above were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $273 million of cash used by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020. Inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment, increased by $170 million, primarily due to the increased number of systems under operating lease and usage-based arrangements and build-up to mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supply, or other matters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased by $112 million, primarily due to an increase in leasing and an increase in deferred commissions. Accounts payable decreased by $32 million, primarily due to the timing of payments. Accrued compensation and employee benefits decreased by $17 million, primarily due to the timing of bonus payments. The unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $37 million increase in other liabilities, primarily due to additional income tax reserves, and a $15 million increase in deferred revenue, primarily due to the effects of the Customer Relief Program.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.60 billion exceeded our net income of $1.38 billion, primarily due to the following factors:\n1.Our net income included non-cash charges of $538 million, consisting primarily of the following significant items: share-based compensation of $336 million; depreciation expense and losses on the disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $160 million; and amortization of intangible assets of $43 million.\n2.The non-cash charges outlined above were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $322 million of cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019. Inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment, increased by $361 million, primarily due to the increased number of systems under operating lease and usage-based arrangements and build-up to address the growth in the business as well as to mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supply, or other matters. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased by $117 million, primarily due to an increase in leasing, an increase in deferred commissions, and an increase in prepaid taxes, driven by the timing of tax payments. The unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $57 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits, primarily due to higher headcount, a $39 million decrease in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of collections, and a $36 million increase in deferred revenue, primarily due to the increased volume of sales contracts.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $561 million, the acquisition of property and equipment of $342 million, and the Orpheus Medical acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $38 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, consisted of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $669 million, the acquisition of property and equipment of $426 million, and the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, of $60 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, consisted of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $774 million, the acquisition of property and equipment of $187 million, and the acquisition of businesses of $88 million.\nWe invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may, at any time, contain investments in U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-U.S. government agency securities, cash deposits, and money market funds.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted primarily of taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards of $175 million, cash used in the repurchase of approximately 0.2 million shares of our common stock in the open market for $134 million, and the payment of deferred purchase consideration of $85 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $309 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, consisted primarily of cash used in the repurchase of approximately 0.6 million shares of our common stock in the open market for $270 million and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards of $159 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $273 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $237 million, partially offset by taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards of $120 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur business is not capital equipment intensive. However, with the growth of our business and our investments in property and facilities and in manufacturing automation, capital investments in these areas have increased. We expect these capital investments to exceed $300 million in 2021 and remain in a relatively consistent range in 2022. We intend to fund these needs with cash generated from operations.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe have the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nOperating leases. We lease spaces for operations in the U.S. as well as in Japan, Mexico, China, South Korea, and other foreign countries. We also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. These leases have varying terms up to 15 years. Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all of our non-cancellable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further details.\nPurchase commitments and obligations. These amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services, commitments for capital expenditures and construction-related activities for which we have not received the services, and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration, and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, and/or commercial milestones. For instances in which the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above.\n2017 Tax Act deemed repatriation tax. As of December 31, 2020, our obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax is $204 million, which is expected to be paid in installments in accordance with the 2017 Tax Act.\nWe are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions. See \u201cNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d which describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include:\n\u2022the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments;\n\u2022the standalone selling prices used to allocate the contract consideration to the individual performance obligations, which impacts revenue recognition;\n\u2022the allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts, which impacts revenue;\n\u2022the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit margins;\n\u2022the valuation of and assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross profit margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization;\n\u2022the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, which impacts gross profit margin and operating expenses;\n\u2022the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and\n\u2022the estimate of probable loss associated with legal contingencies, which impacts accrued liabilities and operating expenses.\nInvestments Valuation\nFair Value. Our investment portfolio may, at any time, contain investments in U.S. treasuries and U.S. government agency securities, non-U.S. government securities, taxable and/or tax-exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits, money market funds, and equity investments with and without readily determinable value. The assessment of the fair value of investments can be difficult and subjective. U.S. GAAP establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Valuation of Level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult. Level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. There were no Level 3 securities for the periods presented.\nAfter determining the fair value of our available-for-sale instruments, we identify instruments with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value. Available-for-sale instruments in an unrealized loss position are written down to fair value through a charge to other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. For the remaining securities, we assess what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Factors considered in determining whether a credit-related loss exists include the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the extent of the loss related to credit of the issuer, and the expected cash flows from the security. These judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations.\nAdditionally, we have investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which are generally recorded at cost, plus or minus subsequent observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments, less impairments. As part of our assessment for impairment indicators, we consider significant deterioration in the earnings performance and overall business prospects of the investee as well as significant adverse changes in the external environment these investments operate. If our qualitative assessment indicates the investments are impaired, the fair value of these equity securities would be estimated, which would involve a significant degree of judgement and subjectivity.\nNo significant impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, net unrealized losses on investments of $29.5 million and $20.4 million, net of tax, respectively, were included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).\nRevenue recognition. Our system sale arrangements contain multiple products and services, including system(s), system components, system accessories, instruments, accessories, and service. Other than service, we generally deliver all of the products upfront. Each of these products and services is a distinct performance obligation. System accessories, instruments, accessories, and service are also sold on a standalone basis.\nFor multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which we separately sell the products or services. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then we estimate the standalone selling prices considering market conditions and entity-specific factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the products and services, geographies, type of customer, and market conditions. We regularly review standalone selling prices and maintain internal controls over establishing and updating these estimates.\nOur system sales arrangements generally include a five-year period of service. The first year of service is generally free and included in the system sale arrangement and the remaining four years are billed at a stated service price. Revenue that is allocated to the service obligation is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period.\nAllowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. We record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of certain products by customers. As a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result.\nSimilarly, we make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable, especially analyzing the aging and nature of accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sales transactions before shipment is authorized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount that we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result.\nInventory valuation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. The cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excessive or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nIntangible assets. Our intangible assets include identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets include developed technology, patents, distribution rights, customer relationships, licenses, and non-competition arrangements. All of our identifiable intangible assets have finite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair value-based test. There have been no such impairments.\nIdentifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. If the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.\nThe valuation and classification of intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment of useful lives for purposes of amortization involves judgments and the use of estimates. The evaluation of these intangible assets and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to the assumptions made. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets\u2019 new, shorter useful lives. No impairment charge or accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. If conditions are different from management\u2019s current estimates, material write-downs of long-lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nBusiness combinations. We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration, including contingent consideration, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. The estimates\nand assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows, and the determination of the assets\u2019 life cycle. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made.\nAccounting for stock options. We account for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term. The assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value of stock options. Changes in expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value and determining this input is not highly subjective.\nWe use implied volatility based on our traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of relying on implied volatility, we considered the following:\n\u2022the sufficiency of the trading volume of our traded options;\n\u2022the ability to reasonably match the terms, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price of our traded options to options granted; and\n\u2022the length of the term of our traded options used to derive implied volatility.\nThe expected term represents the weighted-average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the observed and expected time to exercise. We determine expected term based on historical exercise patterns and our expectation of the time it will take for employees to exercise options still outstanding.\nChanges in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of stock options and, consequently, the related amount of share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAccounting for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period.\nWe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of our deferred tax assets are not recoverable in the future, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. In order for our deferred tax assets to be recoverable, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, in determining the need for a valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2020, we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets ultimately will be recovered with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. We believe that, due to the computation of California taxes under the single sales factor, it is more likely than not that our California deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nAccounting for legal contingencies. From time to time, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings involving product liability, intellectual property, shareholder derivative actions, securities class actions, insurance, employee-related, and other matters. We record a liability and related charge to earnings in our Consolidated Financial Statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment is re-evaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with any outside legal counsel that\nrepresents us. If a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWhen determining the estimated probable loss or range of losses, significant judgment is required to be exercised in order to estimate the amount and timing of the loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. The final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict and, therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. Consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee \u201cNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate and Market Risk\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while supporting the Company's liquidity requirements. To achieve this objective, we maintain a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments in a variety of high quality securities, including U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-U.S. government agency securities, cash deposits, and money market funds. The securities are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The weighted average duration of our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, was approximately 0.7 years. If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity. A hypothetical increase in interest rate by 25 basis points would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $10.5 million as of December 31, 2020. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks.\nUncertain financial markets could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income and credit markets. The credit ratings of the securities we have invested in could deteriorate and may have an adverse impact on the carrying value of these investments.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we generally sell our products and services in local currencies where we have direct distribution channels. We operate in a number of markets on a direct sales basis and incur operating expenses in local currencies. We also purchase certain product components from non-U.S. suppliers in local currency. As a result, because a portion of our operations consist of sales activities outside of the U.S., we have foreign exchange exposures to non-U.S. dollar revenues, operating expenses, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and foreign currency bank balances.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 23% of total revenue. The objective of our hedging program is to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our net cash flow from foreign currency denominated sales and expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenue would have decreased by approximately $72.6 million if the U.S. dollar exchange rate strengthened by 10%. We also hedge the net recognized non-functional currency balance sheet exposures with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. A 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate against all currencies to which we have exposure, after considering foreign currency hedges and offsetting positions as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in an approximately $1.7 million increase in the carrying amounts of those net assets. Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the hypothetical gains and losses discussed above based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposure and hedging transactions. Bank counterparties to foreign exchange forward contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties that meet certain minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor credit ratings and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk, we will adjust our exposure to various counterparties.\nAlthough we sell to distributors outside of the U.S. in U.S. dollars, strengthening of the dollar can impact our distributors\u2019 margins and could impact the end customers\u2019 ability to purchase our product if our distributors seek to recover the impact of the change in the dollar by increasing product and service prices. Less than 10% of our revenue is conducted through distributors outside the U.S. Strengthening of the dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. are subject to risks typical of operations outside of the U.S. including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.",

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, in 2018.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nDetermination of Standalone Selling Prices Related to System Sale Arrangements\nAs described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $1,178.9 million of systems revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company's system sale arrangements include a combination of the following performance obligations: system(s); system components; system accessories; instruments; accessories; and system service. For multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products or services. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then management estimates the standalone selling price considering market conditions and entity-specific factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the products and services, geographies, and type of customer.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the determination of standalone selling prices related to system sale arrangements is a critical audit matter are the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the estimates of standalone selling prices used to allocate the transaction price of an arrangement to each distinct performance obligation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls over the revenue recognition process, including controls over the determination of the estimates of standalone selling prices. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for determining the estimates of standalone selling prices; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the overall methodology used by management to develop the estimates, including the appropriateness of the data inputs related to the products and services, geographies, and type of customer used in the methodology; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the methodology; and (iv) testing the accuracy of management's calculations of estimated selling prices.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 9, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2014.\nINTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PAR VALUE AMOUNTS)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(IN MILLIONS)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(IN MILIONS)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(IN MILLIONS)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc. (\u201cIntuitive\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) develops, manufactures, and markets the da Vinci\u00ae Surgical System and the Ion\u00ae endoluminal system. The Company\u2019s products and related services enable physicians and healthcare providers to improve the quality of and access to minimally invasive care. The systems consist of a surgeon console or consoles, a patient-side cart, a high-performance vision system, and proprietary instruments and accessories.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the results and balances of the Company\u2019s majority-owned joint venture (\u201cJoint Venture\u201d) with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (\u201cFosun Pharma\u201d). Chindex Medical Limited (\u201cChindex\u201d), a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma, has been its distribution partner for da Vinci Surgical Systems in China. The Company holds a controlling financial interest in the Joint Venture, and the noncontrolling interest is reflected as a separate component of the consolidated stockholders\u2019 equity. The noncontrolling interest\u2019s share of the earnings in the Joint Venture is presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nBeginning in 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory. The Company adopted this standard using the modified retrospective approach and, as a result, recorded a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting estimates that require management\u2019s most significant, complex, and subjective judgments include the valuation and recognition of investments, revenue recognition and the valuation of revenue and allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts, the valuation of inventory, the valuation of and assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives, the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets, along with the assessment of recoverability, and liabilities, and the estimates for legal contingencies. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties\nThe carrying amounts for financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Marketable securities and derivative instruments are stated at their estimated fair values, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Company\u2019s investment securities and derivative instruments consist of various major corporations, financial institutions, municipalities, and government agencies of high credit standing.\nThe Company\u2019s accounts receivable are primarily derived from billings related to revenue arrangements with customers and distributors located throughout the world. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The Company provides reserves for potential credit losses but has not experienced significant losses to date. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, 67% and 66%, respectively, of accounts receivable were from domestic customers.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, domestic revenue accounted for 68%, 70%, and 71% of total revenue, respectively, while outside of the U.S. revenue accounted for 32%, 30%, and 29%, respectively, of total revenue for each of the years then ended.\nThe Company is subject to additional risks and uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict. The Company's customers are diverting resources to treat COVID-19 patients and deferring elective surgical procedures, both of which are likely to impact customers' ability to meet their obligations, including to the Company. Furthermore, capital markets and economies worldwide have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that the impact could cause an extended local and/or global economic recession. Such economic disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business as hospitals curtail and reduce capital and overall spending. Policymakers around the globe have responded with fiscal policy actions to support the healthcare industry and economy as a whole. However, the magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain.\nThe severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact on the Company's customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Company's future results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by delays in payments of outstanding receivables, supply chain disruptions, uncertain or reduced demand, and the impact of any initiatives or programs that the Company may undertake to address financial and operational challenges faced by its customers. As of the date of issuance of these Financial Statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations is uncertain.\nCustomer Relief Program\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, the Company introduced a series of programs to provide financial relief to customers (the \u201cCustomer Relief Program\u201d). As part of the Customer Relief Program, the Company provided its customers service fee credits, extended payment terms, and deferred payments related to Intuitive System Leasing arrangements. The Customer Relief Program ended at the end of the third quarter of 2020.\nService fee credits. As part of the Customer Relief Program, the Company provided service fee credits to customers based on the reduction in the utilization of their systems during the second and third quarters of 2020 relative to a pre-COVID-19 level baseline. The Company reflected the service fee credits as a reduction of service revenue and accounts receivable in the quarter they were earned by its customers. The service fee credit program resulted in a $80 million decrease in service revenue in 2020.\nShort-term payment relief. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company introduced a payment deferral program to provide financial relief to qualified customers. This relief extended payment terms up to 180 days for qualified and creditworthy customers.\nThe Company also introduced a lease payment deferral program in which creditworthy customers with active Intuitive System Leasing arrangements could elect to defer lease payments up to five months that are payable at the end of the lease by extending the lease term. This program did not result in substantial increases in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee, and the Company elected to apply the relief provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) FAQ on accounting for COVID-19 and market volatility by not applying the lease modification guidance in ASC 842 to the lease arrangements affected by the deferrals and lease extensions.\nFor operating lease arrangements where the lease term was extended by adding the deferred period to the end of the contract, the Company recalculated the straight-line revenue based on the revised terms, consistent with the treatment accepted by the FASB FAQ on accounting for COVID-19. For its sales-type lease arrangements impacted, the Company accounted for the deferral in the timing of lease payments as if there were no changes in the lease contract, consistent with the treatment accepted by the FASB FAQ on accounting for COVID-19. While the short-term payment relief offered did not have a material impact on the results of operations, the Company deferred $15 million of lease billings and extended payment terms associated with $181 million of billings during the program, of which $19 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity from date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $18.0 million of restricted cash associated with its insurance programs and bank guarantee collateral. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $15.0 million of restricted cash associated with its insurance programs. Restricted cash was included in prepaids and other current assets and intangible and other assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInvestments\nAvailable-for-sale investments. The Company\u2019s investments may consist of U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-U.S. government agency securities, and money market funds. The Company has designated all investments as available-for-sale and, therefore, such investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For securities sold prior to maturity, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are recorded in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments with remaining maturities at date of purchase greater than 90 days and remaining maturities as of the reporting period less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term investments.\nAll of the Company\u2019s investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Available-for-sale investments in an unrealized loss position are written down to fair value through a charge to other income, net, if the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company evaluates the remaining securities to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Factors considered in determining whether a credit-related loss exists include the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the extent of the loss related to credit of the issuer, and the expected cash flows from the security. No significant charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures the fair value of money market funds, certain U.S. treasury securities, and equity investments with readily determinable value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets as Level 1 securities. Marketable securities measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs are primarily comprised of commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies, municipal notes, and equity investments without readily determinable value. The Company reviews trading activity and pricing for these investments as of the measurement date. When sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not available, the Company uses market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third-party data providers. These inputs either represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observable market data. This approach results in the Level 2 classification of these securities within the fair value hierarchy.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs include direct materials, direct labor, and normal manufacturing overhead. The cost basis of the Company\u2019s inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excessive or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Additionally, the cost basis of the Company's inventory does not include any unallocated fixed overhead costs associated with abnormally low utilization of our factories.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally, as follows:\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, was $220.6 million, $156.7 million, and $105.9 million, respectively.\nCapitalized Software Costs for Internal Use\nThe Company capitalizes direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use software, including enterprise-wide business software, that are incurred during the application development stage. These capitalized costs are recorded as capitalized software within property, plant, and equipment. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Once the software is ready for its intended use, amounts capitalized are amortized over an estimated useful life of up to 5 years, generally on a straight-line basis.\nImplementation Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\nThe Company capitalizes qualified implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract for which it is the customer in accordance with the requirements for capitalizing costs incurred to develop internal-use software. These capitalized implementation costs are recorded within intangible and other assets, net, and are generally amortized over the fixed, non-cancellable term of the associated hosting arrangement on a straight-line basis.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree using acquisition-date fair values. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination, including contingent consideration. The excess of the acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. The Company includes the results of operations of the businesses that are acquired as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter, or if circumstances indicate their value may no longer be recoverable. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities. The Company continues to operate in one segment, which is considered to be the sole reporting unit and, therefore, goodwill was tested for impairment at the enterprise level.\nIntangible assets are carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. The Company does not have intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the intangible assets\u2019 useful lives, which range from approximately 2 to 9 years.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets, which include finite-lived intangible and tangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the net book value to the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. The Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds its fair value. No material impairment losses were incurred in the periods presented.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company\u2019s revenue consists of product revenue resulting from the sale of systems, system components, instruments and accessories, and service revenue. The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is a legally enforceable contract between the Company and its customer, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. The Company\u2019s revenues are measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with each customer, net of any sales incentives and taxes collected from customers that are remitted to government authorities.\nThe Company\u2019s system sale arrangements generally contain multiple products and services. For these bundled sale arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services as separate performance obligations if they are a distinct product or service that is separately identifiable from other items in bundled packages and if a customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The Company\u2019s system sale arrangements include a combination of the following performance obligations: system(s); system components; system accessories; instruments; accessories; and system service. The Company\u2019s system sale arrangements generally include a five-year period of service. The first year of service is generally free and included in the system sale arrangement, and the remaining four years are generally included at a stated service price. The Company considers the service terms in the arrangements that are legally enforceable to be performance obligations. Other than service, the Company generally satisfies all of the performance obligations up-front. System components, system accessories, instruments, accessories, and service are also sold on a stand-alone basis.\nThe Company recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. The Company generally recognizes revenue for the performance obligations at the following points in time:\nSystem sales. For systems (including system components and system accessories) sold directly to end customers, revenue is recognized when the Company transfers control to the customer, which is generally at the point when acceptance occurs that indicates customer acknowledgment of delivery or installation, depending on the terms of the arrangement. For systems sold through distributors, revenue is recognized generally at the time of shipment. The Company\u2019s system arrangements generally do not provide a right of return. The systems are generally covered by a one-year warranty. Warranty costs were not material for the periods presented.\nInstruments and accessories. Revenue from sales of instruments and accessories is recognized when control is transferred to the customers, which generally occurs at the time of shipment but also occurs at the time of delivery,\ndepending on the customer arrangement. The Company allows its customers in the normal course of business to return unused products for a limited period of time subsequent to initial purchase and records an allowance against revenue for estimated returns.\nService. Service revenue is recognized over the term of the service period, as the customer benefits from the services throughout the service period. Revenue related to services performed on a time-and-materials basis is recognized when performed.\nThe Company offers its customers the opportunity to trade in their older systems for a credit towards the purchase of a newer generation system. The Company generally does not provide specified price trade-in rights or upgrade rights at the time of system purchase. Such trade-in or upgrade transactions are separately negotiated based on the circumstances at the time of the trade-in or upgrade, based on the then fair value of the system, and are generally not based on any pre-existing rights granted by the Company. Accordingly, such trade-ins and upgrades are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement for a system sale. Traded-in systems could be reconditioned and resold. The Company accounts for the fair value of the traded-in system in the total consideration in the arrangement by including the net realizable value of the traded-in system less a normal profit margin. The value of the traded-in system is determined as the amount, after reconditioning costs are added, that will allow a normal profit margin on the sale of the reconditioned unit to be generated. When there is no market for the traded-in units, no value is assigned. Traded-in units are reported as a component of inventory until resold, or otherwise disposed.\nIn addition, customers may also have the opportunity to upgrade their systems at a price determined at the time of the upgrade, for example, by adding a second surgeon console for use with the da Vinci Surgical System. Such upgrades are performed by completing component level upgrades at the customer\u2019s site. Upgrade revenue is recognized when the component level upgrades are complete and all revenue recognition criteria are met.\nFor multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products or services. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then the Company estimates the standalone selling price considering market conditions and entity-specific factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the products and services, geographies, and type of customer. The Company regularly reviews standalone selling prices and updates these estimates as necessary.\nAssets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nThe Company has determined that certain sales incentives provided to the Company\u2019s sales team are required to be capitalized when the Company expects to generate future economic benefits from the related revenue-generating contracts subsequent to the initial system sales transaction. When determining the economic life of the contract acquisition assets recognized, the Company considers historical service renewal rates, expectations of future customer renewals of service contracts, and other factors that could impact the economic benefits that the Company expects to generate from the relationship with its customers. The costs capitalized as contract acquisition costs included in intangible and other assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $53.1 million and $51.5 million as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Company did not incur any impairment losses during the periods presented.\nIntuitive System Leasing\nThe Company enters into lease arrangements with certain qualified customers. Leases have terms that generally range from 24 to 84 months and are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. The Company also leases systems to certain qualified customers under usage-based arrangements that have terms up to 84 months. For these usage-based lease arrangements, the lease fee is generally billed monthly in arrears based on a predetermined per-use fee, and usage is generally defined as the number of da Vinci procedures performed with the system.\nRevenue related to multiple-element arrangements are allocated to lease and non-lease elements based on their relative standalone selling prices as prescribed by the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy. Lease elements generally include a system or system component, while non-lease elements generally include service, instruments, and accessories. For some lease arrangements, customers are provided with the right to purchase the system leased at some point during and/or at the end of the lease term. Except for certain usage-based lease arrangements, lease arrangements generally do not provide rights for the customers to exit or terminate the lease without incurring a penalty. Certain lease arrangements may also include upgrade rights that allow customers to upgrade the leased system to newer technology at some point during the lease term. Generally, these upgrade rights do not specify the terms, including the price or structure of the future upgrade transactions, as those terms are negotiated based on the circumstances at the time of the upgrade, including the then-fair value of the system as well as other factors.\nIn determining whether a transaction should be classified as a sales-type or operating lease, the Company considers the following terms at lease commencement: (1) whether title of the system transfers automatically or for a nominal fee by the end\nof the lease term, (2) whether the present value of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the leased system, (3) whether the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the leased system, (4) whether the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the leased system that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, and (5) whether the underlying system is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the Company at the end of the lease term.\nThe Company generally recognizes revenue from sales-type lease arrangements at the time the system is accepted by the customer, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenue related to lease elements from sales-type leases is presented as product revenue. Revenue related to lease elements from operating lease arrangements is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term or based upon system usage and is presented as product revenue. Revenue related to usage-based arrangements is recognized as the customers utilize the systems.\nOther Leasing Arrangements\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. For arrangements where the Company is the lessee, operating leases are included in intangible and other assets, net, other accrued liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Company currently does not have any finance leases.\nOperating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and operating leases liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities, as the Company does not have insight to the inputs necessary to calculate the implicit rate of the leases. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate when the Company is reasonably certain the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company also has lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The Company elected the practical expedient not to separate non-lease components from lease components for the Company's real estate and automobile leases. Additionally, the Company applied a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities for the Company's automobile leases. The Company also elected to apply the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption in which ROU assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for leases with terms of 12 months or less.\nCredit Losses\nTrade accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer\u2019s ability to pay. For the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, bad debt expense was not significant.\nNet investment in sales-type leases. The Company enters into sales-type leases with certain qualified customers to purchase its systems. Sales-type leases have terms that generally range from 24 to 84 months and are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. The allowance for loan loss is based on the Company's assessment of current expected lifetime loss on lease receivables. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the lease receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. Lease receivables are considered past due 90 days after invoice.\nThe Company manages the credit risk in net investment in sales-type leases using a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following: size of operations; profitability, liquidity, and debt ratios; payment history; and past due amounts. The Company also uses credit scores obtained from external providers as a key indicator for the purposes of determining credit quality. The following table presents credit quality by class of net investment in sales-type lease as of December 31, 2020. The following table summarizes the amortized cost basis by year of origination and credit quality indicator as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, credit losses related to net investment in sales-type leases were not significant.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities. The Company's investment portfolio at any point in time contains investments in U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-U.S. government agency securities, cash deposits, and money market funds. The Company segments its portfolio based on the underlying risk profiles of the securities and have a zero loss expectation for U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities. The Company regularly reviews the securities in an unrealized loss position and evaluates the current expected credit loss by considering factors such as historical experience, market data, issuer-specific factors, and current economic conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the credit losses related to available-for-sales debt securities were not significant. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no credit losses recognized related to available-for-sales debt securities.\nThe Company's exposure to credit losses may increase if its customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage, and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty associated with local or global economic recessions, disruption associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, or other customer-specific factors. Although the Company has historically not experienced significant credit losses, it is possible that there could be a material adverse impact from potential adjustments of the carrying amount of lease and trade receivables as hospital cash flows are impacted by their response to the COVID-19 pandemic and deferral of elective surgical procedures.\nAllowance for Sales Returns\nThe allowance for sales returns is based on the Company\u2019s estimates of potential future returns of certain products related to current period product revenue. The Company analyzes historical returns, current economic trends, and changes in customer demand and acceptance of the Company\u2019s products.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based employee compensation plans using the fair value recognition and measurement provisions under U.S. GAAP. The Company\u2019s share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company estimates expected forfeitures at the time of grant and revises the estimate, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimated.\nExpected Term: The expected term represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to be outstanding prior to being exercised. The Company determines expected term based on historical exercise patterns and its expectation of the time that it will take for employees to exercise options still outstanding.\nExpected Volatility: The Company uses market-based implied volatility for purposes of valuing stock options granted. Market-based implied volatility is derived based on actively traded options with expirations greater than one year on the Company\u2019s common stock. The extent to which the Company relies on market-based volatility when valuing options depends, among other things, on the availability of traded options on the Company\u2019s stock and the term of such options. Due to sufficient volume of the traded options, the Company used 100% market-based implied volatility to value options granted, which the Company believes is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock option.\nThe fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing quoted price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of the grant. See \u201cNote 10. Share-Based Compensation,\u201d for a detailed discussion of the Company\u2019s stock plans and share-based compensation expense.\nComputation of Net Income per Share\nBasic net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is computed using the weighted-average number of the Company\u2019s shares and dilutive potential shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares primarily consist of employee stock options, restricted stock units, and shares to be purchased by employees under the Company\u2019s employee stock purchase plan.\nU.S. GAAP requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares, and similar equity instruments granted by the Company be treated as potential common shares outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of equity awards, which is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising\nstock options and the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and include amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with co-development research and development licensing arrangements, costs of prototypes, salaries, benefits and other headcount-related costs, contract and other outside service fees, and facilities and overhead costs.\nForeign Currency and Other Hedging Instruments\nFor subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency, their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses from foreign currency translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders\u2019 equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For all non-functional currency account balances, the re-measurement of such balances to the functional currency results in either a foreign exchange gain or loss, which is recorded to interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same accounting period that the re-measurement occurred.\nThe Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The terms of the Company\u2019s derivative contracts are generally twelve months or shorter. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and expenses. The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The hedging program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedging or non-hedging instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Gains and losses in OCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into earnings through interest and other income, net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in interest and other income, net.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected more likely than not to be realized in the future.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes interest and penalty on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax expense.\nThe Company recognizes excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the provision for income taxes as discrete items in the period when the awards vest or are settled. The Company accounts for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) as period costs when incurred.\nSegments\nThe Company operates in one segment. The chief operating decision maker regularly reviews the operating results of the Company on a consolidated basis as part of making decisions for allocating resources and evaluating performance. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, 83% and 85% of long-lived assets were in the United States, respectively. Revenue is attributed to a geographic region based on the location of the end customer.\nLegal Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings involving product liability, intellectual property, shareholder derivative actions, securities class actions, and other matters. A liability and related charge are recorded to earnings in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and\nthe amount can be reasonably estimated. The assessment is re-evaluated each period and is based on all available information, including discussion with outside legal counsel. If a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. If a material loss is reasonably possible but not probable and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred.\nWhen determining the estimated probable loss or range of losses, significant judgment is required to be exercised in order to estimate the amount and timing of the loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. The final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict and, therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. Consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326) (\"Topic 326\"), which replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost. The Company adopted Topic 326 on January 1, 2020, using a modified retrospective transition method, which requires a cumulative-effect adjustment, if any, to the opening balance of retained earnings to be recognized on the date of adoption with prior period not restated. The cumulative-effect adjustment recorded on January 1, 2020, was not material. Refer to the description of the Company's \"Credit Losses\" accounting policy in the \"Significant Accounting Policies\" section above.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company continues to monitor new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and does not believe any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nThe following tables summarize the Company\u2019s cash and available-for-sale marketable securities\u2019 amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair value by significant investment category reported as cash and cash equivalents or short-term or long-term investments as of December 31, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\nThe following table summarizes the contractual maturities of the Company\u2019s cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments (excluding cash and money market funds) at December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities, because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. Gross realized gains recognized on the sale of investments was $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and not material for the prior year comparative period. Gross realized losses recognized on the sale of investments were not material for the periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2020, and 2019, net unrealized gains/(losses) on investments of $29.5 million and $20.4 million, net of tax, respectively, were included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following tables present the breakdown of the available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses at December 31, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\nThe unrealized losses on the available-for-sale investments are related to corporate securities, U.S. treasuries, and U.S. government agencies. The Company determined these unrealized losses to be temporary. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary included the length of time and extent to which the investment\u2019s fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the extent of the loss related to credit of the issuer, the expected cash flows from the security, the Company\u2019s intent to sell the security, and whether or not the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost.\nEquity Investments\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company generally recognizes equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments (in millions):\nThe Company recognized a $66.2 million increase in fair value, which was reflected in Interest and other income, net, due to changes in observable prices for certain equity investments that had been held at cost, because they lacked readily determinable market values. A total of $44.8 million of this increase in fair value was related to an equity investment in preferred shares of InTouch Technologies, Inc. (\"InTouch\"), an entity that was acquired by Teladoc Health, Inc. (\"Teladoc\"), a publicly traded company, on July 1, 2020. Upon acquisition, the Company's shares were converted to shares in Teladoc, which have a readily determinable value. The Company was restricted from selling these shares for a period of six months. There were no decreases in fair value reflected in net income due to impairments.\nForeign Currency Derivatives\nThe objective of the Company\u2019s hedging program is to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flow from foreign currency-denominated sales, expenses, and intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d). The derivative assets and liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs.\nCash Flow Hedges. The Company enters into currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the USD, primarily the Euro (\u201cEUR\u201d), the British Pound (\u201cGBP\u201d), the Japanese Yen (\u201cJPY\u201d), and the Korean Won (\u201cKRW\u201d). The Company also enters into currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted expense transactions denominated in EUR and Swiss Franc (\u201cCHF\u201d).\nFor these derivatives, the Company reports the unrealized after-tax gain or loss from the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders\u2019 equity and reclassifies the amount into earnings in the same period in which the hedge transaction affects earnings. The amounts reclassified to revenue and expenses related to the hedged transactions and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges were not material for the periods presented.\nOther Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments. Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts that the Company uses to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the USD, primarily the EUR, GBP, JPY, KRW, CHF, Indian Rupee (\"INR\"), Mexican Peso (\"MXN\"), Chinese Yuan (\"CNY\"), and New Taiwan Dollar (\"TWD\").\nThese derivative instruments are used to hedge against balance sheet foreign currency exposures. The related gains and losses were as follows (in millions):\nThe notional amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume. Total gross notional amounts (in USD) for derivatives and the aggregate gross fair value outstanding at the end of each period were as follows (in millions):\nNOTE 4. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT DETAILS\nThe following tables provide details of selected consolidated financial statement items (in millions):\nSupplemental Cash flow Information\nThe following table provides supplemental cash flow information (in millions):\nNOTE 5. REVENUE\nThe following table presents revenue disaggregated by types and geography (in millions):\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations relates to amounts allocated to products and services for which revenue has not yet been recognized. A significant portion of this amount relates to performance obligations in the Company\u2019s service contracts that will be satisfied and recognized as revenue in future periods. In addition, non-lease elements associated with the Company\u2019s lease arrangements are primarily comprised of service contracts that will be satisfied and recognized as revenue in future periods. The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations and the non-lease elements associated with the lease arrangements were $1,682 million as of December 31, 2020. The remaining performance obligations are expected to be satisfied over the term of the individual sales arrangements, which generally are 5 years. Service revenue associated with the lease arrangements will generally be recognized over the service period, which generally coincides with the lease term.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nThe following information summarizes the Company\u2019s contract assets and liabilities (in millions):\nThe Company invoices its customers based on the billing schedules in its sales arrangements. Payments are generally due 30 days from date of invoice. Contract assets for the periods presented primarily represent the difference between the revenue that was recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of the related performance obligations satisfied and the contractual billing terms in the arrangements. Deferred revenue for the periods presented primarily relates to service contracts where the service fees are billed up-front, generally quarterly or annually, prior to those services having been performed. The associated deferred revenue is generally recognized over the term of the service period. The Company did not have any significant impairment losses on its contract assets for the periods presented.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $282 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $307 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018.\nIntuitive System Leasing\nThe following table presents product revenue from Intuitive System Leasing arrangements (in millions):\nNOTE 6. LEASES\nLessor Information related to Intuitive System Leasing\nSales-type Leases. Lease receivables relating to sales-type lease arrangements are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (in millions):\nContractual maturities of gross lease receivables as of December 31, 2020, are as follows (in millions):\nOperating Leases. The Company\u2019s operating lease terms are generally less than seven years. Future minimum lease payments related to the non-cancellable portion of operating leases (which excludes contingent payments related to usage-based arrangements) as of December 31, 2020, are as follows (in millions):\nVariable lease revenue relating to usage-based arrangements was not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nLessee Information\nThe Company enters into operating leases for real estate, automobiles, and certain equipment. Operating lease expense was $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For leases with terms of 12 months or less, the related expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not material.\nSupplemental cash flow information for the year ended December 31, 2020, related to operating leases was as follows (in millions):\nSupplemental balance sheet information, as of December 31, 2020, related to operating leases was as follows (in millions, except lease term and discount rate):\nAs of December 31, 2020, the future payments related to the Company's operating lease liabilities are scheduled as follows (in millions):\nNOTE 7. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nAcquisitions in 2020\nOrpheus Medical\nIn February 2020, the Company acquired Orpheus Medical Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (\u201cOrpheus Medical\u201d) to deepen and expand the Company's integrated informatics platform (the \u201cOrpheus Medical Acquisition\u201d). Orpheus Medical provides hospitals with information technology connectivity, as well as expertise in processing and archiving surgical videos.\nAcquisitions in 2019\nChindex\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the Company's majority-owned Joint Venture with Fosun Pharma acquired certain assets from Chindex and its affiliates, a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma, including distribution rights, customer relationships, and certain personnel on January 5, 2019, which collectively met the definition of a business. Chindex was the Company's distributor of da Vinci products and services in China. The transaction enhances the Company's ability to serve patients, surgeons, and hospitals in China.\nThe total purchase consideration of $66.0 million, as of the acquisition date, included a contingent consideration liability of $64.7 million and an upfront cash payment of $1.3 million. The amount and timing of the contingent consideration payments were based upon the underlying performance of the business in 2019 and 2020. As of the acquisition date, the estimated total undiscounted contingent consideration was approximately $81 million. As of December 31, 2020, the total undiscounted contingent consideration has decreased by approximately $1 million due to a change in the timing of the milestone achievements. The contingent consideration liability was measured at estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant inputs not observable in the market and, thus, represents a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions included (1) the probability and timing of milestone achievements based on projected future revenues through 2019 and 2020, and (2) the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the milestone payments. At each reporting period until the contingent consideration is settled, the Company remeasures the contingent consideration liability and records changes in fair value within selling, general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the contingent consideration liability changed due to payments of $53.7 million and net additional expenses of $11.3 million, primarily related to accretion due to the passage of time. Changes to the contingent consideration estimate can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion due to the passage of time, or change in estimates in the performance of the business. The assumptions related to determining the fair value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration adjustment recorded in any given period.\nThe Company recorded $1.7 million of net tangible assets, $58.6 million of intangible assets, and $5.7 million of residual goodwill. Intangible assets included distribution rights of $48.2 million and customer relationships of $10.4 million, which are being amortized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. Key assumptions included (1) the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, and (2) the discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows. The goodwill is not amortizable for income tax purposes. The allocation of purchase consideration was completed in the third quarter of 2019. There were no adjustments to the provisional amounts in the measurement period.\nSch\u00f6lly\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company acquired certain assets and operations from Sch\u00f6lly Fiberoptic GmbH (\"Sch\u00f6lly\"), including manufacturing process technology, a non-compete agreement, certain personnel, and net tangible assets on August 31, 2019, which collectively met the definition of a business. The Company believes that the transaction strengthens the Company's supply chain and manufacturing capacity for imaging products used in the Company's da Vinci systems. The total purchase consideration of $101.4 million consists of an initial cash payment of $34.4 million and deferred cash payments totaling approximately $67.0 million, of which $13.6 million continues to be deferred as of December 31, 2020. The timing of the future payments is based upon achieving certain integration steps, which will be substantially completed in early 2021.\nThe Company recorded $11.5 million of net tangible assets, which included $6.7 million of inventory and $1.4 million of cash, $31.0 million of intangible assets, and $58.9 million of residual goodwill. The balances include the net impact of adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price within the one year measurement period, which decreased goodwill by $0.8 million during 2020. There was no significant impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income as result of these adjustments. Intangible assets included manufacturing process technology of $28.0 million and non-compete provisions of $3.0 million, which are being amortized over a weighted-average period of 6.6 years. Key assumptions included (1) the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, and (2) the discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows. The allocation of purchase consideration is considered preliminary with provisional amounts primarily related to working capital.\nGoodwill primarily consists of the manufacturing and other synergies of the combined operations and the value of the assembled workforce. The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nIn 2019, the Company has included the results of the acquired businesses, since their acquisition dates, in its Consolidated Financial Statements, and the revenues and earnings were not material in the year. Pro forma results of operations related to the acquisitions have not been presented, because the operating results of the acquired businesses are not considered material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill (in millions):\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed. As of December 31, 2020, there has been no impairment of goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table summarizes the components of gross intangible asset, accumulated amortization, and net intangible asset balances as of December 31, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets was $49.8 million, $43.0 million, and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets as of December 31, 2020, is as follows (in millions):\nThe preceding expected amortization expense is an estimate. Actual amounts of amortization expense may differ from estimated amounts due to additional intangible asset acquisitions, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, impairment of intangible assets, accelerated amortization of intangible assets, and other events.\nNOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nOur commitments include an estimated amount of approximately $630 million relating to the Company\u2019s open purchase orders and contractual obligations that occur in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which the Company has not received the goods or services, commitments for capital expenditures and construction-related activities for which the Company has not received the services, and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust its requirements based on its business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Additionally, the Company has committed to make certain future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration, and development arrangements. Payments under these arrangements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain specified developmental, regulatory, and/or commercial milestones. For instances in which the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies are not included in the estimated amount.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings relating to securities laws, product liability, intellectual property, insurance, contract disputes, employment, and other matters. Certain of these lawsuits and claims are described in further detail below. It is not possible to predict what the outcome of these matters will be, and the Company cannot guarantee that any resolution will be reached on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nA liability and related charge to earnings are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The assessment is re-evaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to each case. Nevertheless, it is possible that additional future legal costs (including settlements, judgments, legal fees, and other related defense costs) could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, and future results of operations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recorded pre-tax litigation charges (benefits) of $(1.2) million, $0.5 million, and $45.2 million, respectively, related to securities class action lawsuits and product liability claims.\nProduct Liability Litigation\nThe Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of individual product liability lawsuits filed in various state and federal courts. The plaintiffs generally allege that they or a family member underwent surgical procedures that utilized the da Vinci Surgical System and sustained a variety of personal injuries and, in some cases, death as a result of such surgery. Several of the filed cases have trial dates in the next 12 months.\nThe cases raise a variety of allegations including, to varying degrees, that plaintiffs\u2019 injuries resulted from purported defects in the da Vinci Surgical System and/or failure on the Company\u2019s part to provide adequate training resources to the healthcare professionals who performed plaintiffs\u2019 surgeries. The cases further allege that the Company failed to adequately disclose and/or misrepresented the potential risks and/or benefits of the da Vinci Surgical System. Plaintiffs also assert a variety of causes of action, including, for example, strict liability based on purported design defects, negligence, fraud, breach of express and implied warranties, unjust enrichment, and loss of consortium. Plaintiffs seek recovery for alleged personal injuries and, in many cases, punitive damages. The Company disputes these allegations and is defending against these claims.\nThe Company\u2019s estimate of the anticipated cost of resolving the pending cases is based on negotiations with attorneys for the claimants. The final outcome of the pending lawsuits and claims, and others that might arise, is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict, and the ultimate cost associated with these product liability lawsuits and claims may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, and future results of operations. Although there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount recognized at this time.\nPatent Litigation\nOn June 30, 2017, Ethicon LLC, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., and Ethicon US LLC (collectively, \u201cEthicon\u201d) filed a complaint for patent infringement against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint, which was served on the Company on July 12, 2017, alleges that the Company\u2019s EndoWrist Stapler instruments infringe several of Ethicon\u2019s patents. Ethicon asserts infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,585,658, 8,479,969, 9,113,874, 8,998,058, 8,991,677, 9,084,601, and 8,616,431. A claim construction hearing occurred on October 1, 2018, and the court issued a scheduling order on December 28, 2018. On March 20, 2019, the court granted the Company's Motion to Stay pending an Inter Partes Review to\nbe held at the Patent Trademark and Appeals Board to review patentability of six of the seven patents noted above and vacated the trial date. On August 1, 2019, the court granted the parties' joint stipulation to modify the stay in light of Ethicon's U.S. International Trade Commission (\"USITC\") complaint against Intuitive involving U.S. Patent Nos. 8,479,969 and 9,113,874, discussed below.\nOn August 27, 2018, Ethicon filed a second complaint for patent infringement against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges that the Company\u2019s SureForm 60 Staplers infringe five of Ethicon\u2019s patents. Ethicon asserts infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,884,369, 7,490,749, 8,602,288, 8,602,287, and 9,326,770. The Company filed an answer denying all claims. On March 19, 2019, Ethicon filed a Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint, removing allegations related to U.S. Patent No. 9,326,770 and adding allegations related to U.S. Patent Nos. 9,844,379 and 8,479,969. On July 17, 2019, the court entered an order denying the amendment, without prejudice, and granting the parties' joint stipulation to stay the case in its entirety in light of the USITC investigation involving U.S. Patent Nos. 9,844,369 and 7,490,749, discussed below.\nOn May 30, 2019, Ethicon filed a complaint with the USITC, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,884,369, 7,490,749, 9,844,379, 9,113,874, and 8,479,969. On June 28, 2019, the USITC voted to institute an investigation (No. 337-TA-1167) with respect to the claims in this complaint. The accused products include the Company's EndoWrist 30, EndoWrist 45, SureForm 45, and SureForm 60 Staplers, as well as the stapler reload cartridges. In March 2020, Ethicon dismissed its claims concerning U.S. Patent No. 7,490,749. The evidentiary hearing has been set for February 8, 2021. An unfavorable ruling by the USITC could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, including a prohibition on importing the accused products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nBased on currently available information, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters.\nCommercial Litigation\nOn February 27, 2019, Restore Robotics LLC and Restore Repair LLC (\"Restore\") filed a complaint alleging anti-trust claims against the Company. On May 13, 2019, Restore filed an amended complaint alleging anti-trust claims relating to the da Vinci Surgical System and EndoWrist service, maintenance, and repair processes. On September 16, 2019, the Court partially granted and partially denied the Company's Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint.\nOn September 30, 2019, the Company filed an answer denying the anti-trust allegations and a counterclaim against Restore. The Company filed amended counterclaims after the Court partially granted and partially denied Restore's motion to dismiss the counterclaim. The amended counterclaims allege that Restore violated the Federal Lanham Act, the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and that Restore is also liable to the Company for Unfair Competition and Tortious Interference with Contract. On January 7, 2020, the Court denied Restore's motion to dismiss the amended counterclaims. In its initial scheduling order, the Court stated that it anticipated trial in this case to occur in or before February 2022.\nOn September 28, 2020, Rebotix Repair Inc. (\u201cRebotix\u201d) filed a complaint alleging anti-trust claims against the Company relating to EndoWrist service, maintenance, and repair processes. The complaint was formally served on the Company on October 6, 2020, and the Court anticipates trial in this case to occur in or around March 2022. On December 8, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.\nBased on currently available information, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters.\nNOTE 9. STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nStock Repurchase Program\nThrough December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has authorized an aggregate of $7.5 billion of funding for the Company\u2019s common stock repurchase program (the \u201cRepurchase Program\u201d) since its establishment in March 2009. The most recent authorization occurred in January 2019 when the Board increased the authorized amount available under the Repurchase Program to $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining amount of share repurchases authorized by the Board under the Repurchase Program was approximately $1.6 billion.\nThe following table provides the stock repurchase activities during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in millions, except per share amounts):\nThe Company uses the par value method of accounting for its stock repurchases. As a result of share repurchase activities during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company reduced common stock and additional paid-in capital by an aggregate of $8 million, $15 million, and zero, respectively, and charged $126 million, $255 million, and zero, respectively, to retained earnings.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, are as follows (in millions):\nNOTE 10. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nStock Plans\n2010 Incentive Award Plan. In April 2010, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the 2010 Incentive Award Plan (\u201c2010 Plan\u201d). Under this plan, the Company issues nonqualified stock options (\u201cNSOs\u201d) and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) to employees and certain consultants. The 2010 Plan generally permits NSOs to be granted at no less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, with terms of 10 years from the date of grant. The 2010 Plan expires in 2029. In April 2020, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved an amended and restated 2010 Plan to provide for an increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance from 28,450,000 to 32,450,000. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 8.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2010 Plan. A maximum of 3.5 million of these shares can be awarded as RSUs.\n2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. In October 2009, the Board adopted the 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan (\u201cNew Hire Plan\u201d). The New Hire Plan provides for the shares to be used exclusively for the grant of RSUs and NSOs to new employees (\u201cNew Hire Options\u201d), who were not previously employees or non-employee directors of the Company. The Compensation Committee approves all equity awards under the New Hire Plan, which are granted to newly-hired employees once a month on the fifth business day of each month after their hire. Options are granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and have a term not to exceed 10 years.\nIn April 2015, the Board of Directors amended and restated the New Hire Plan to provide for an increase in the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the New Hire Plan from 3,465,000 to 4,365,000. The New Hire Plan expired in October 2019 and, therefore, there are no shares reserved for future issuance under the New Hire Plan. However, awards granted prior to the plan's expiration continue to remain outstanding until their original expiration date.\nEmployee Option Vesting. Historically, the Company has made annual option grants on February 15 (or the next business day if the date is not a business day) and on August 15 (or the next business day if the date is not a business day). Beginning in 2020, the Company changed the timing of its annual equity award grants to the last business day of February and on the same date in August, or if that date is not a business day, the next business day. The February grants vest 6/48 upon completion of 6 months of service and 1/48 per month thereafter. The August stock option grants vest 7/48 at the end of one month and 1/48 per month thereafter through a 3.5-year vesting period.\nNew Hire Options generally vest 12/48 upon completion of one year of service and 1/48 per month thereafter. Option vesting terms are determined by the Board and, in the future, may vary from past practices.\n2000 Non-Employee Directors\u2019 Stock Option Plan. In March 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Non-Employee Directors\u2019 Stock Option Plan (the \u201cDirectors\u2019 Plan\u201d). In October 2009, the automatic evergreen increase provisions were eliminated so that no further automatic increases will be made to the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Directors\u2019 Plan. In addition, the common stock authorized for issuance under the Directors\u2019 Plan was reduced to 450,000. Options are granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and have a term not to exceed 10 years. Prior to 2016, initial stock option grants to new non-employee directors vested over a three-year period with 12/36 of the shares vesting after one year from the date of grant and 1/36 of the shares vesting monthly thereafter. Annual stock option grants vested one year from the date of the grant. Since 2016, new non-employee directors receive pro-rated stock option grants that vest on the same term as the annual stock option grants. The Directors' Plan was terminated in November 2020 and, therefore, there are no shares reserved for future issuance under the Directors' Plan. However, options granted prior to the plan's termination continue to remain outstanding until their original expiration date.\n2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In March 2000, the Board adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d). Employees are generally eligible to participate in the ESPP if they are customarily employed by the Company for more than 20 hours per week and more than 5 months in a calendar year and are not 5% stockholders of the Company. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may select a rate of payroll deduction up to 15% of their eligible compensation subject to certain maximum purchase limitations. The duration for each offering period is 24 months and is divided into four purchase periods of approximately six months in length. Offerings are concurrent. The purchase price of the shares under the offering is the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the shares on the offering date or 85% of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date. A two-year look-back feature in the ESPP causes the offering period to reset if the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the first or last day of the purchase period is less than that on the original offering date. ESPP purchases by employees are settled with newly-issued common stock from the ESPP\u2019s previously authorized and available pool of shares. In April 2017, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved an amended and restated ESPP to provide for an increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance from 6,090,315 to 7,590,315.\nThe Company issued 0.2 million, 0.2 million, and 0.2 million shares under the ESPP, representing approximately $71.2 million, $56.4 million, and $46.8 million in employee contributions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 1.1 million shares reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.\nRestricted Stock Units. Equity awards granted to employees and non-employee directors include a mix of stock options and RSUs. The RSUs to employees vest in one-fourth increments annually over a four-year period. The RSUs to existing non-employee directors vest one year from the date of grant or at the next Annual Shareholders Meeting, whichever comes first. New non-employee directors receive pro-rated RSU grants that vest on the same term as the annual RSU grants. The number of shares issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory tax withholdings, which are paid in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of the Company\u2019s employees.\nStock Option Information\nOption activity during fiscal 2020 under all the stock plans was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised under the Company\u2019s stock plans determined as of the date of option exercise was $598 million, $512 million, and $527 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Cash received from option exercises and employee stock purchase plans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, was $309 million, $273 million, and $237 million, respectively. The income tax benefit from stock options exercised was $135 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes significant ranges of outstanding and exercisable options as of December 31, 2020 (number of shares and aggregate intrinsic value in millions):\n(1)The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the Company\u2019s closing stock price of $818.10 at December 31, 2020, which would have been received by the option holders had all in-the-money option holders exercised their options as of that date.\nAs of December 31, 2020, a total of 4.4 million shares of stock options vested and expected to vest had a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 5.2 years, an aggregate intrinsic value of $2,275 million, and a weighted-average exercise price of $299.61.\nRestricted Stock Units Information\nRSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2020, was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nAs of December 31, 2020, 1.6 million shares of RSUs were expected to vest with an aggregate intrinsic value of $1,309 million. The aggregate vesting date fair value of RSUs vested was $478 million, $433 million, and $334 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes share-based compensation expense (in millions):\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted under the Company\u2019s share-based compensation plans and rights to acquire stock granted under the Company\u2019s employee stock purchase plan. The weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options, the rights to acquire stock under the ESPP, and RSUs, as well as the weighted average assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock options and rights to acquire stock under the ESPP that were granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were as follows:\nAs share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was a total of $119 million, $534 million, and $19 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchases, respectively. The unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years for unvested stock options, 2.2 years for unvested restricted stock units, and 1.0 years for rights granted to acquire common stock under the ESPP.\nNOTE 11. INCOME TAXES\nIncome before provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, consisted of the following (in millions):\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, consisted of the following (in millions):\nIncome tax expense differs from amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, as a result of the following (in millions):\nDeferred income taxes reflect tax carry forwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company had valuation allowances of $81.4 million and $57.2 million, respectively, primarily related to California research and development credit carry forwards, for which the Company does not believe a tax benefit is more likely than not to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had foreign federal net operating loss carryforwards of $253 million and foreign local net operating loss carryforwards of $534 million, which will begin to expire in 2024, if not utilized. Utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations. The Company does not expect the limitations to result in any permanent loss of these tax benefits.\nThe Company intends to repatriate earnings from its Swiss subsidiary and joint venture in Hong Kong, as needed, and the U.S. and foreign tax implications of such repatriations are not expected to be significant. The Company will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from the rest of our foreign subsidiaries, which are not significant.\nIn August 2019, Swiss tax reform was enacted, which resulted in a higher statutory rate for the Company's Swiss entity for years after 2019. The Company remeasured its Swiss deferred tax asset at the enacted tax rate and recorded an income tax benefit of $51.3 million in its 2019 income tax provision.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, gross interest related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued was $11.0 million, $2.9 million, and $2.6 million, respectively. The Company\u2019s net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest are presented in other long-term liabilities and long term deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTotal gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, were $176.3 million, which, if recognized, would result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s effective tax rate.\nIn July 2015, a U.S. Tax Court opinion (the \u201c2015 Opinion\u201d) was issued involving an independent third party related to charging foreign subsidiaries for share-based compensation. Based on the findings of the U.S. Tax Court, direct share-based compensation had been excluded from our intercompany charges starting in 2015. In June 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (the \"Ninth Circuit\") reversed the 2015 Opinion (the \u201cNinth Circuit Opinion\u201d). Subsequently, a re-hearing of the case was requested, but was denied in November 2019. In February 2020, a petition was filed to appeal the Ninth Circuit Opinion to the U.S. Supreme Court. The petition was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 22, 2020, which makes the Ninth Circuit Opinion binding precedent in the Ninth Circuit. As a result, the Company recorded an increase in the income tax provision of $39.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company will continue to monitor future IRS actions or other developments regarding this matter and will assess the impact of any such developments to our income tax provision in the quarter that they occur. We are treating share-based compensation expense in accordance with the Ninth Circuit Opinion for 2020 and future periods.\nThe Company files federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in many U.S. and OUS jurisdictions. Years before 2016 are closed for the significant jurisdictions. Certain of the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits could change due to activities of various tax authorities, including potential assessment of additional tax, possible settlement of audits, or through normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rate in the period in which they change. Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, the Company cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in the next 12 months.\nThe Company is subject to the examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The outcome of these audits cannot be predicted with certainty. The Company\u2019s management regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes. If any issues addressed in the Company\u2019s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u2019s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\nNOTE 12. NET INCOME PER SHARE\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (in millions, except per share amounts):\nShare-based compensation awards of approximately 0.6 million, 0.7 million, and 0.4 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. common stockholders, because the effect of including such shares would have been anti-dilutive in the periods presented.\nNOTE 13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company sponsors various retirement plans for its eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. For employees in the U.S., the Company maintains the Intuitive Surgical, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). As allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides tax-deferred salary contributions for eligible U.S. employees. The Plan allows employees to contribute up to 100% of their annual compensation to the Plan on a pre-tax and after-tax basis. Employee contributions are limited to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches 200% of employee contributions up to $1,500 per calendar year per person. All matching employer contributions vest immediately.\nSELECTED QUARTERLY DATA\n(UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\nSCHEDULE II\nVALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS\n(IN MILLIONS)\n(1)Primarily represents products returned.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nInherent Limitations Over Internal Controls\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of our assessment under the framework in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included under \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial statements.",
