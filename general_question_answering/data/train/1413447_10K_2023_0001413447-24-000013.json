We engage with leading global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and sell products in all major geographic regions.\nOur legal name is NXP Semiconductors N.V. and our commercial name is \u201cNXP\u201d or \u201cNXP Semiconductors.\u201d We were incorporated in the Netherlands in 2006 and are a Dutch public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap).\nOur corporate seat is in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. Our principal executive office is at High Tech Campus 60, 5656 AG Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and our telephone number is +31 40 2729999. Our registered agent in the United States is NXP USA, Inc., 6501 William Cannon Dr. West, Austin, Texas 78735, United States of America, phone number +1 512 9338214.\nSemiconductor Market Overview\nSemiconductors perform a broad variety of functions within electronic products and systems, including processing data, sensing, storing information and converting or controlling electronic signals. Semiconductors vary significantly depending upon the specific function or application of the end product in which the semiconductor is used and the customer who is deploying it. Semiconductors also vary on a number of technical characteristics including the degree of integration, level of customization, programmability and the process technology utilized to manufacture the semiconductor. Advances in semiconductor technology have increased the functionality and performance of semiconductors, improving their features and power consumption characteristics while reducing their size and cost. These advances have resulted in growth of semiconductors and electronic content across a diverse array of products. The semiconductor market totaled $527 billion in 2023.\nReporting Segment\nNXP has one reportable segment representing the entity as a whole, which reflects the way in which our chief operating decision maker executes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the Company.\nEnd Market Exposure\nOur product groups are focused on four primary end markets that we believe are characterized by long-term, attractive growth opportunities and where we believe we enjoy sustained, competitive differentiation through our technology leadership. The four end markets are Automotive, Industrial & IoT, Mobile, and Communication Infrastructure & Other.\nAutomotive Industrial & IoT Mobile Comm Infra & Other\nCore Applications ADAS\nElectrification\nVehicle Networks\nSecure Car Access\neCockpit\nBody Comfort & Convenience\nPowertrain Smart Home\nEdge Nodes\nFactory and Building Automation\nHome Entertainment\nPower and Energy\nSmart Appliances\nMedical\nSmart Retail Smartphones\nWearables\nMobile Accessories Wireless Basestations\nNetwork & Security\nBanking Cards Government ID documents\nTransit Cards\nRFID Tagging\nKey Growth Drivers Radar systems\nSoftware Defined Vehicle, incl. Vehicle Computer\nDomain and zonal\nprocessors\nElectrification systems Secure connected Edge solutions\nSmart home and industrial automation\nConnectivity and crossover processors UWB mobile access solutions RF Power Systems\ni.Automotive\nGrowth in automotive semiconductor sales relies on (1) global vehicle sales and production trends and (2) the increase in semiconductor content per vehicle. In the past few years, and going forward, we believe the later will be the most important driver for growth in the automotive semiconductor market, while the stagnation of global vehicle sales will make the former less relevant. The increase of the average semiconductor content is being driven by the proliferation of electronic features throughout the vehicle, especially for driver assistance (ADAS), and by the increasing penetration of electrified vehicles, which have much higher semiconductors content. Despite the decline in vehicles sales and production in 2020 due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 and the moderate growth in 2021 and 2022 due to the global supply crisis, the increase in semiconductor content per vehicle continued. In 2023, the supply chain crisis eased and vehicle production rebounded to the level of 2019.\nWe believe three mega-trends will drive the semiconductor content increase in the future: Autonomous driving, electrification and the software defined vehicle. Each of the megatrends involve new functions and each new function requires new technologies. The path to full autonomy is driving the increase of driver assistance systems in the car already today. In the same way, strict emissions regulations as well as consumer willingness for energy efficient cars are accelerating the penetration of electrification. Last but not least, many consumers want their cars to be service oriented, hyper-connected, configurable and upgradeable, in the same way as they are used to with their smartphones. We expect such consumer demands will lead to new vehicle architectures and eventually to software defined vehicles (SDV).\nSemiconductor content per vehicle continues to increase due to government regulation of safety and emissions, standardization of higher-end options across a greater number of vehicle classes as well as consumer demand for greater fuel efficiency, advanced safety, multimedia applications and connectivity. Automotive safety features are evolving from passive safety systems to active safety systems with Advanced Driving Assisted Systems (ADAS) such as radar and vision systems. Semiconductor content is also increasing in engine management and fuel economy applications, like Battery Management Systems (BMS). Comfort and convenience systems and user interface applications, as well as infotainment features such as digital audio broadcasting are also areas with high semiconductor content increases. In addition, the use of networking in automotive applications continues to increase as various subsystems communicate within the automobile and with external devices and networks. Furthermore, we believe networking will play a key role in the electrical/electronic architecture transformation towards domain and zonal architectures. Smart car access, automotive Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and Near-Field Communication (NFC) are gaining ground in automotive as well, enabling the connection of vehicles and car keys to portable devices and the infrastructure. Data integrity and security hardware features for safeguarding memory, communication and system data are also increasing in importance.\nDue to the high degree of regulatory scrutiny and safety requirements, the automotive semiconductor market is characterized by stringent qualification processes, zero defect quality processes, functionally safe design architecture, high reliability, extensive design-in timeframes and long product life cycles, which results in significant barriers to entry.\nii.Industrial & IoT\nThe world is becoming smarter, more connected and more data driven, and the Industrial & IoT market sits at the center of this global digital transformation. The Industrial & IoT market is highly fragmented with a diverse collection of products and applications such as factory automation, smart home, smart appliances, home entertainment, smart retail, power and energy and medical electronics.\nGrowth in the Industrial market is driven by the replacement of traditional mechanical equipment by smart, energy-saving and connected electronic equipment using various sensors, processors, connectivity, analog and security chipsets that align well with NXP\u2019s ability to provide a complete range of processing, connectivity and secure solutions. We expect that carbon emissions reduction efforts (e.g., global net zero emission commitments) will also be a key growth driver with large transformations expected of our energy systems. Factories, buildings and homes will need to rely much more on renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind) and increase efficient use of energy. The way we generate and store energies will likely be more distributed. The energy ecosystem needs to develop and ensure smart, efficient and reliable power delivery.\nIn IoT, growth is driven by the increasing use of high-performance edge and media devices (e.g., home entertainment, connected home assistants, home and building control and security) and low power IoT nodes where NXP scalable solutions across the entire embedded processing spectrum are ideally suited.\nThe increase in productivity with real-time insights and efficient processes for factory automation, the enhancement in consumer convenience, security and comfort for smart homes, the reduction of resource consumption and better energy efficiency for smart factories and cities, the increase in performance of rich media content in smart consumer devices and the need for better health prevention and monitoring solutions (wearables, smart patches and smart drug delivery devices) to help ensure the future health of millions of people are some of the key use-cases driving growth in Industrial & IoT.\nFinally, with the growing number of connected devices, latency, privacy and bandwidth have become critical limiting factors and Edge computing solves this by bringing the intelligence closer to the source. Security and tamper-detection capabilities are also becoming essential features of these Industrial & IoT solutions.\niii.Mobile\nMobile includes applications such as smartphones, feature phones, tablets, wearables and mobile accessories. NXP has a strong focus on mobile wallet, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and specialty custom analog solutions. The demand for faster speeds, improved battery life, fast charging, mobile wallets, highly secure localization and sensing technology, mobile transit and authentication is driving increased semiconductor content for NXP. The growth in this market is mainly driven by the increasing attach rate of these features across devices, vendors and regions, from flagship smartphones down to feature phones, from developed countries to emerging regions. UWB, thanks to its unique precision, robustness, and reliability, is emerging as a secure, fine-ranging technology capable of enabling a wide range of innovative location-based user experiences. The technology is gaining momentum thanks to wider chipset availability, adoption across various devices by multiple brands, and the formation of a strong UWB ecosystem across the whole supply chain where NXP is well positioned.\niv.Communication Infrastructure & Other\nThe Communication Infrastructure & Other end market is a combination of three different application markets, namely 5G networks, digital network communications and secure edge identification solutions.\nThe transition to 5G and the cloudification of the network present a significant opportunity for NXP. More base stations are needed and massive MIMO radio technology - which provides better throughput and better spectrum efficiency - is greatly expanding the number of antennas and power amplifiers needed. Small cells are also deployed to improve coverage and capacity of wireless networks. In power amplification, as more bandwidth and higher frequencies are needed, we observe an increasing adoption of GaN technology because of its higher power output and efficiency.\nWorkplaces are evolving from offices to homes, and consumers and enterprises need to adapt to changing working conditions, leading to increasing demand for better digital communication capabilities and digital content. This creates strong growth in the network communications market. Meanwhile, billions of connected devices exchange more and more data, leading to strong demand for device edge and cloud processing solutions.\nFinally, in secure edge identification solutions, NXP has extensive experience providing customers with solutions for applications demanding the highest security and reliability (ePassports, eID credentials, transportation & payment cards and RFID solutions). Further digitalization of governmental services, the trend towards secure contactless payment and the need to improve tracking, traceability and authentication of products are driving demand across these applications.\nProducts\nWe offer customers a broad portfolio of semiconductor products, including microcontrollers, application processors, communication processors, connectivity chipsets, analog and interface devices, RF power amplifiers, security controllers and sensors. Using our strong Automotive & Industrial portfolios, we are enhancing our product offerings by providing solutions for the growing ecosystems in & around the vehicle, in smart factories and in homes and buildings. Enabling innovation at our customers as well as reducing complexity, integration efforts and shorten time to market is a key element of our strategy. We believe we have the broadest ARM processor portfolio in the industry, from microcontrollers to crossover processors and from application processors to communication processors.\ni.Microcontrollers\nWe have been a provider of MCU solutions for more than 40 years. MCUs integrate all of the major components of a computing system onto a single semiconductor device. Typically, this includes a programmable processor core, memory, interface circuitry and other components. MCUs provide the digital logic, or intelligence, for electronic applications, controlling electronic equipment or analyzing sensor inputs. We are a trusted, long-term supplier of MCUs to many of our customers, especially in the automotive, smartcards, industrial and consumer markets. Our MCU product portfolio ranges from 8-bit products to higher performance 16-bit and 32-bit products with on-board flash memory. Our portfolio is highly scalable, and is coupled with our extensive software and design tools. This enables our customers to design-in and deploy our MCU families, leveraging a consistent software development environment. Due to the scalability of our portfolio we are able to help future-proof our customer\u2019s products as their systems evolve, becoming more complex or requiring greater processing capabilities over time. For automotive applications, our microcontrollers deliver the required reliability, security and functional safety to address current and future automotive challenges. In an increasingly connected and networked society, where security is playing a more important role, our MCU families are equipped with varying security features (such as remote authentication, system/data integrity, secure communication and anomaly detection) to address different type of security risks. Our i.MX RT crossover processors are built using applications processors chassis, delivering a high level of integration, high speed peripherals, enhanced security, and engines for enhanced user experience (for example, 2D/3D graphics), but powered by a low-power MCU core running a real-time operating system like Amazon Free RTOS or Zephyr RTOS. The i.MX RT series offers the high performing Arm Cortex-M core, real-time functionality, and MCU usability at an affordable price. Our new MCX MCU family of Arm Cortex-M based MCUs, builds on the strength of our Kinetis and LPC portfolio. The MCX series also integrates our machine learning neural processing unit for machine learning applications. Our S32x Automotive Processing Platform offers scalability across products and multiple application domains with S32K MCU\u2019s based on Arm Cortex-M cores with Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL-D) capabilities.\nii.Application Processors\nApplication processors consist of a computing core with embedded memory and special-purpose hardware and software for secure multimedia applications such as graphics and video.

We have also successfully engaged with leading OEMs to drive custom and semi-custom products which in turn allow us to refine and accelerate our innovation and product roadmaps.\nvi.Radio Frequency Devices\nNXP is the market leader in High-Performance Radio Frequency (HPRF) power amplifiers. We have an extensive portfolio of LDMOS, GaN and GaAs RF transistors. NXP\u2019s solutions range from sub-6GHz to 40GHz and from milliwatts to kilowatts. For base stations, NXP offers a full range of solutions addressing 5G RF power amplification needs from MIMO to massive MIMO based active antenna systems for cellular and millimeter Wave (mmWave) spectrum bands. We are engaged with the majority of the largest customers in mobile base stations and in several other application areas. In low and medium Power Amplification, NXPs low noise amplifier (LNA) portfolio offers solutions to meet future design needs in a wide range of applications. Two technologies serve the LNA portfolio, each with distinct advantages for their applications. Wireless infrastructure applications and many general wireless applications are served with III-V technology LNAs. Advanced SiGe\ntechnology is utilized in LNAs designed for wireless communication, cellular, consumer, automotive and industrial applications.\nvii.Security Controllers\nNXP is the market leader in security controller ICs. Our security controller ICs are embedded in smart cards (ePassports, electronic ID credentials, payment cards and transportation cards), as well as in consumer electronic and smart devices, for example in smartphones, tablets and wearables. These security controller ICs are suited for applications demanding the highest security and reliability. Nearly all of our security products consist of multi-functional solutions comprised of passive RF connectivity devices facilitating information transfer from the user document to reader infrastructure; secure, tamper-proof microcontroller devices in which information is securely encrypted (\u201csecure element\u201d); and secure real-time operating system software products to facilitate the encryption-decryption of data, and the interaction with the reader infrastructure systems. Our solutions are developed to provide extreme levels of security of user information, undergoing stringent and continued global governmental and banking certification processes, and to deliver a high level of device performance enabling significant throughput and productivity to our customers.\nviii.Sensors\nSensors serve as a primary interface in embedded systems for advanced human interface and contextual awareness that mimic the human \u201c5 senses\u201d interaction with the external environment. We provide several categories of semiconductor-based environmental and inertial sensors for the Automotive market, including pressure, inertial, magnetic and gyroscopic sensors that provide orientation detection, gesture recognition, tilt to scroll functionality and position detection.\nManufacturing\nWe manufacture semiconductors through a combination of wholly owned manufacturing facilities, a manufacturing facility operated jointly with another semiconductor company and third-party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. We manage our manufacturing assets together through one centralized organization to ensure we realize scale benefits in asset utilization, purchasing volumes and overhead leverage across businesses.\nThe manufacturing of a semiconductor involves several phases of production, which can be broadly divided into \u201cfront-end\u201d and \u201cback-end\u201d processes. Front-end processes take place at highly complex wafer manufacturing facilities (called fabrication plants or \u201cwafer fabs\u201d), and involve the imprinting of substrate silicon wafers with the precise circuitry required for semiconductors to function. The front-end production cycle requires high levels of precision and involves as many as 300 process steps. Back-end processes involve the assembly, test and packaging of semiconductors in a form suitable for distribution. In contrast to the highly complex front-end process, back-end processing is generally less complicated, and as a result we tend to determine the location of our back-end facilities based more on cost factors than on technical considerations.\nWe primarily focus our internal and joint venture wafer manufacturing operations on running proprietary specialty process technologies that enable us to differentiate our products on key performance features, and we generally outsource wafer manufacturing in process technologies that are available at third-party wafer foundries when it is economical to do so. In addition, we increasingly focus our in-house manufacturing on our competitive 8-inch wafer facilities, which predominantly run manufacturing processes in the 140 nanometer, 180 nanometer and 250 nanometer process nodes. This focus increases our return on invested capital and reduces capital expenditures.\nOur front-end manufacturing facilities use a broad range of production processes and proprietary design methods, including complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), bipolar, bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) and double-diffused metal on silicon oxide semiconductor (DMOS) technologies. Our wafer fabs produce semiconductors with line widths ranging from 90 nanometers to 3 microns for integrated circuits and 0.5 microns to greater than 4 microns for discretes. This broad technology portfolio enables us to meet increasing demand from customers for system solutions, which require a variety of technologies.\nOur back-end manufacturing facilities test and package many different types of products using a wide variety of processes. To optimize flexibility, we use shared technology platforms for our back-end assembly operations. Most of our assembly and test activities are maintained in-house.\nThe following table shows selected key information with respect to our major front-end and back-end facilities:\n1) Joint venture with TSMC.\nWe use a large number of raw materials in our front- and back-end manufacturing processes, including silicon wafers, chemicals, gases, lead frames, substrates, molding compounds and various types of precious and other metals. Our most important raw materials are the raw, or substrate, silicon wafers we use to make our semiconductors. We purchase these wafers, which must meet exacting specifications, from a limited number of suppliers in the geographic region in which our fabrication facilities are located. At our wholly owned fabrication plants, we use raw wafers ranging from 6 inches to 8 inches in size. Our SSMC wafer fab facility, which produces 8 inch wafers, is jointly owned by TSMC and ourselves. Emerging fabrication technologies employ larger wafer sizes and, accordingly, we expect that our production requirements will in the future shift towards larger substrate wafers.\nWe typically source our other raw materials in a similar fashion as our wafers, although our portfolio of suppliers is more diverse. Some of our suppliers provide us with materials on a just-in-time basis, which permits us to reduce our procurement costs and the negative cash flow consequences of maintaining inventories, but exposes us to potential supply chain interruptions. We purchase most of our raw materials on the basis of fixed price contracts.\nOver the past two years, semiconductor supply chains have been constrained. As a result, there has been a tendency towards longer term supply contracts with suppliers in exchange for capacity. From an operational perspective, all of our manufacturing facilities continue to operate around the world in accordance with guidance issued by local and national government authorities.\nOn January 9, 2024, NXP acquired shares in the newly founded European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) GmbH, in Dresden, Germany. ESMC is 70% owned by TSMC, with Bosch, Infineon, and NXP each owning 10%. NXP has committed to invest approximately $550m (\u20ac500m) for our investment in ESMC and is entitled to 10% of the fab facility capacity. Production at ESMC is currently targeted to begin by the end of 2027.\nSales, Marketing and Customers\nWe market our products and solutions worldwide to a variety of OEMs, contract manufacturers and distributors. We generate demand for our products by delivering product solutions to our customers, and supporting their system design-in activities by providing application architecture expertise and local field application engineering support.\nOur sales and marketing teams are organized into five regions, which are EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), the Americas, Japan, South Korea, and China and Asia Pacific. These sales regions are responsible for managing customer relationships and creating demand for our solutions through the full ecosystem development. In addition, our sales and marketing teams in the regions partner with our distributors and our large number of mass market customers.\nOur sales and marketing strategy focuses on key defined verticals in Automotive, Industrial & IoT, Communication Infrastructure, and Mobile deepening our relationship with our top OEMs and electronic manufacturing service customers, expanding our reach to our mass market customers, startups and our distribution partners and becoming their preferred supplier, which we believe assists us in reducing sales volatility in challenging markets. We have long-standing customer relationships with most of our customers. Our 10 largest OEM end customers, some of whom are supplied by distributors, in alphabetical order, are Apple, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Hyundai, LGE Automotive, Samsung, Visteon, and Vitesco. We also have a strong position with our distribution partners, including our three largest, Arrow, Avnet and WT Micro.\nOur revenue is primarily the sum of our direct sales to OEMs plus our distributors\u2019 resale of NXP products. Avnet accounted for 21% of our revenue in 2023 and 20% in 2022. No other distributor accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue. No OEM for which we had direct sales to accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2023 or 2022.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. We direct our research and development efforts largely to the development of new semiconductor solutions where we see significant opportunities for growth. We target applications that require stringent overall system and subsystem performance. As new and challenging applications proliferate, we believe that many of these applications will benefit from our solutions. We have assembled a global team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in RF, analog, power management, interface, security and digital processing.\nWith the intent to outpace market growth we invest in research and development to extend or create leading market positions, with an emphasis on fast growing sizable market segments, such as ADAS, in-vehicle networks and power management, as well as Edge computing to support the successful deployment in the IoT with our cross-over processing technology, but also in emerging markets, such as massive MIMO in RF Power and mmWave for 5G. In addition, we invest a few percent of our total research and development expenditures in research activities that develop fundamental new technologies or product categories that could contribute significantly to our company's growth in the future.\nWe annually perform a fundamental review of our business portfolio and our related new product and technology development opportunities in order to decide on changes in the allocation of our research and development resources. For products targeting established markets, we evaluate our research and development expenditures based on clear business need and risk assessments. For break-through technologies and new market opportunities, we look at the strategic fit and synergies with the rest of our portfolio and the size of the potential addressable market. Overall, we allocate our research and development to maintain a healthy mix of emerging growth and mature businesses.\nSubsidies and Grants\nWe receive subsidies and grants from governments in some countries in the form of direct grants as well as tax credits for R&D activities. Such funding is generally provided to encourage R&D activities, industrialization and local economic development and is generally available to all companies. The conditions for the receipt of government grants and subsidies may include eligibility restrictions, approval by relevant authorities, annual budget appropriations, compliance with relevant regulations or contingent return provisions, as well as specifications regarding objectives and results. The approval process for such funding may last up to several years. Certain specific contracts require compliance with extensive regulatory requirements and set forth certain conditions relating to the funded programs. There could be penalties if these objectives are not fulfilled.\nOur direct grants include those awarded under the European 2nd Important Project of Common European Interest on Microelectronics and Communication Technologies (\u201cIPCEI ME/CT\u201d). During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company was granted IPCEI ME/CT government assistance in multiple EU member states. The duration of the IPCEI ME/CT grants is planned to run until the end of 2029. The conditions to receive the IPCEI ME/CT government assistance include restrictions on eligible expenditures, employment retention, annual budget appropriations by the member states, compliance with member states\u2019 regulations and project objectives and results, as well as repayment conditions. Our dedicated R&D teams across the involved member states under the IPCEI/MT program seek to innovate in core technologies across automotive, industrial and cybersecurity. This includes 5nm, advanced driving assistance and battery management systems in automotive, 6G and Ultra-Wideband as well as artificial intelligence (AI), RISC-V and post-quantum cryptography.\nIntellectual Property\nThe creation and use of intellectual property is a key aspect of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents, trademarks, domain names, retaining trade secrets and defending, enforcing and utilizing our intellectual property rights, where appropriate. We believe this strategy allows us to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies, and helps us to improve the return on our investment in research and development. We have a broad portfolio of approximately 9,500 patent families (each patent family includes all patents and patent applications originating from the same invention). To protect confidential technical information and software, we rely on copyright and trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements as applicable. In situations where we believe that a third party has infringed on our intellectual property, we enforce our rights through all available legal means to the extent that we determine the benefits of such actions to outweigh the costs and risks involved.\nWe own a number of trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. Where we consider it desirable, we develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection. Our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and end-users.\nWhile our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights constitute valuable assets, we do not view any individual right or asset as material to our operations as a whole. We believe it is the combination of our proprietary technology, patents, know-how and other intellectual property rights and assets that creates an advantage for our business.\nIn addition to obtaining our own patents and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into licensing agreements and other arrangements authorizing us to use intellectual property rights, confidential\ntechnical information, software and other technology owned by third parties. We also engage, in certain instances, in licensing and selling of certain of our technology, patents and other intellectual property rights.\nCompetition\nWe compete with many different semiconductor companies on a global basis, including with both integrated device manufacturers (\u201cIDMs\u201d) as well as fabless companies. Nearly all our competitors invest extensively in research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities across a broad spectrum of product lines. Many of our competitors are focused on single applications or market segments. Most of our competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our product lines.\nOur primary key public competitors in alphabetical order include, but are not limited to, Analog Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, Microchip Technology Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Renesas Electronics Corp., STMicroelectronics NV and Texas Instruments Inc.\nThe basis on which we compete varies across end markets and geographic regions. This includes competing on the basis of our ability to develop new products and the underlying intellectual property in a timely manner to meet customer requirements in terms of product features, quality, performance, warranty, availability and cost. In addition, we are asked to deliver full system capabilities which include multiple NXP devices and enabling software. This requires in-depth knowledge of specific applications in target markets in order to develop robust system solutions and qualified customer support resources.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our net revenue does not display consistent or predictable seasonal patterns.\nGovernment Regulation, including Environmental Regulation\nThe information set forth under the \u201cEnvironmental remediation\u201d caption of Note 15 of our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference. For additional discussion of certain risks associated with government and environmental regulation, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe names, ages and positions as of February 22, 2024, of our executive officers, including our chief executive officer, Mr. Sievers, are as follows:\nHuman Capital\nAt NXP, our diverse and talented employees, referred to as team members, drive the innovation that sets our company apart and fuels our success in the market. Our purpose is bringing together bright minds to create breakthrough technologies that make the connected world better, safer, and more secure. Across the globe, we have policies and programs to attract and maintain the best talent, with a specific focus on team member engagement, thought leadership, diversity, equity and inclusion, compensation and benefits, development and growth opportunities, future talent, team member retention and community outreach.\nNXP\u2019s workforce includes direct labor (DL) and indirect labor (IDL). DL are those team members directly involved in manufacturing our products, while IDL consists of individual contributors, managers and executives in other functions such as research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative roles (SG&A). At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 34,200 employees, which includes approximately 1,500 employees in our joint venture. Our NXP global workforce spans three regions encompassing 30+ countries and includes approximately 12,000 team members dedicated to the research and development of our products and solutions (representing 36% of our NXP workforce and 57% of our IDL workforce).\nCorporate Values and Team Member Engagement\nNXP's values are our fundamental beliefs and guiding principles. They speak about how we operate, engage with and develop our team members, and push the boundaries of creativity and innovation. Our values rest on a strong foundation of trust and respect. We hold ourselves accountable to our values by ensuring they are reflected in all of our talent programs, including talent acquisition, enabling performance, rewards and recognition, communications, development, assessment and succession.\nTo assess and improve engagement, NXP regularly conducts our global Winning Culture Survey, which is administered by a third party to ensure confidentiality. NXP is committed to actively listening to team members and solicits feedback on a variety of factors, including engagement, strategy, culture, leadership, innovation, growth, continuous improvement, collaboration, ownership, work environment, ethics, sustainability and diversity, equality and inclusion. In 2023, 90% of team members participated in the survey.\nNXP aims to retain team members and minimize turnover and closely monitors voluntary turnover. During calendar year 2023, our voluntary attrition rate was 4.1% for IDL, 10.4% for our DL population and 6.5% of the total population, a year over year reduction. We continue to drive programs centered around retention actions for strategic roles and top-performing talent as well as broad-based programs targeting all team members.\nDiversity, Equality and Inclusion\nAt NXP, inclusion is key to living our core values which are built on a core foundation of trust and respect. We recognize the value of the unique talents, experiences, backgrounds, cultures and ideas of our diverse team members. Our diversity, equality and inclusion approach is centered around\n\u2022Leadership commitment and ownership;\n\u2022Building and sustaining a qualified and diverse talent pipeline and equitable processes; and\n\u2022Fostering an inclusive culture and a sense of belonging to attract and retain the best talent.\nOur Diversity & Inclusion Council serves as an advocate, resource and governing entity to advance NXP\u2019s global, strategic diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our Board provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on human capital management, including workforce diversity, equality and inclusion.\nNXP Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) help foster NXP\u2019s innovation and growth culture by promoting an inclusive work environment and bring unique perspectives and skills to help those in our communities. Today, we have nine primary ERGs which are open to all team members and include representation in Asia, Europe and North America. Each ERG has defined mission/vision statements and goals, as well as executive oversight and sponsorship.\nTo support our diversity, equality and inclusion approach and demonstrate our commitment to transparency and accountability, we have established the aspirational 2025 diversity, equality and inclusion goals listed below to improve gender representation globally and minority race and ethnicity representation in the United States. We saw an increase in the representation of women in R&D positions, but remained flat or slightly under the prior year results in the other categories. We continue to focus on hiring, developing, and retaining team members across all global sites to meet our 2025 representation goals. While we present gender representation data by men and women, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.\n2025 Diversity, Equality, & Inclusion Goals\n40% Women in Overall Global Workforce\n30% Women in Global Indirect Labor Workforce\n20% Women in Executive Positions*\n25% Women in R&D Positions\n50% Minority Representation in the United States*\n2023 Diversity, Equality, & Inclusion Performance\n36% 25% 16% 20% 52%\n* Executive positions are defined as individuals at the level of Vice President and above. Minority representation includes team members who self-identify as Asian, Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Pacific Islander or two or more races. We also include within minority representation team members who have not self-identified an ethnicity.\nDevelopment and Investing in the Future\nNXP is committed to a 70/20/10 continuous learning model, including mechanisms for learning through on-the-job experiences (70%), learning through others (20%), and learning through education (10%). Using a blend of internally designed and externally sourced courses and learning resources, we offer our global team members a variety of training programs in support of key business processes, requirements and initiatives. We also provide a library of on-demand resources for skills development and microlearning to all our team members.\nWe work to create developmental opportunities for our team members through stretch assignments, project roles, cross-functional interactions, cross-geography engagements, and both temporary and longer-term job rotations - all of which are used to stimulate core skills, develop leadership competency and fuel career growth.\nWe also believe that our commitment to our internship programs and university partnerships are key contributors to developing the new generation of talent, including engineers in our industry and company, and provide a pipeline of recent college graduates into our talent pool. Through our partnerships with universities across the world, we fund and support advanced research programs and projects that demonstrate our commitment to invest in people as well as technology.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe provide team members with total rewards packages consisting of base salary and short-term incentives as well as equity-based long-term incentives for team members with long-term potential. In addition, in an effort to meet the specific needs of our team members and their families, we offer locally competitive benefits programs, which vary by country/region, and include an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement programs, healthcare and insurance benefits, allowances, paid time off, family leave, our flexible work arrangement program, and other team member assistance programs.\nWe believe that pay decisions should be made on three factors: external market conditions, employee performance/contributions and internal equity. NXP utilizes third-party data to formulate compensation and benefits programs that are fair, equitable and competitive. We perform pay reviews twice a year, alongside NXP's rewards processes, to ensure we are delivering pay decisions with an appropriate focus on fairness.\nWe empower leaders to recognize both individual and team accomplishments through a variety of compensation programs. Rewarding performance is a critical element of our overall program. NXP is committed to managing all reward-based compensation programs, including merit increases, short-term incentives and long-term equity incentive awards, to deliver on our pay-for-performance philosophy.\nSince 2022, we have linked a portion of our executive and employee compensation to our ESG Goals. For more information, see our 2024 Proxy Statement and the ESG Goals section in the Corporate Sustainability Report1.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees, and we continuously assess safety risks globally to ensure workplace risks are mitigated. We are certified to the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System, and have developed robust safety programs and initiatives to safeguard our workforce. In 2022, as a follow-up to a previous survey, we conducted a global survey on employee safety, inquiring about opportunities for improvement and asking employees about their comfort level when raising safety concerns. The follow-up survey had a participation rate of approximately 80% and the responses to all questions were more favorable than those provided on the previous survey. In particular, 94% of our employees felt that safety concerns are a high priority for NXP and 98% of employees felt that safety starts with them. We used the results from the follow-up survey to identify improvement opportunities, and have started working at our sites and locations to address these opportunities.\nEmployee Representation\nA number of our team members are members of a labor union and in various countries, local law requires us to inform and consult with employee representatives on matters relating to labor conditions. We have not experienced any material strikes or labor disputes in the past and consider our employee relations to be good.\nWe also have employee-lead worker\u2019s councils in various countries that provide input and oversight to many of the decisions made on behalf of employees.\nClimate and Environment\nProtecting the environment is a key pillar in our Sustainability Policy and corporate strategy because we recognize the need to conserve the earth\u2019s natural resources and reduce emissions. In support of this, we set company-wide aspirational targets intended to optimize our use of resources, minimize waste and continuously improve.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of potential global environmental risks that may adversely affect our business operations, such as climate change or natural disasters.\nWe go a step further, working beyond our operations, to help create a smarter, more sustainable world. We develop innovative product solutions that not only support our sustainability goals but also meet the objectives of our stakeholders. We stay informed about changes in global legislation, by tracking current discussions, timelines and the likelihood of new implementations, and include these potential legislative requirements when we plan for new product introductions.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks related to the semiconductor industry and the markets in which we participate\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical.\nHistorically, the relationship between supply and demand in the semiconductor industry has caused a high degree of cyclicality in the semiconductor market. Semiconductor supply is partly driven by manufacturing capacity, which in the past has demonstrated alternating periods of substantial capacity additions and periods in which no or limited capacity was added. As a general matter, semiconductor companies are more likely to add capacity in periods when current or expected future demand is strong and margins are, or are expected to be, high. Investments in new capacity can result in overcapacity, which can lead to a reduction in prices and margins. In response, companies typically limit further capacity additions, eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied. In addition, demand for semiconductors varies, which can exacerbate the effect of supply fluctuations. As a result of this cyclicality, the semiconductor industry has in the past experienced significant downturns, such as in 1997/1998, 2001/2002 and in 2008/2009, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing life cycles of semiconductor companies\u2019 products and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminishing demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, under-utilization of manufacturing capacity and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. The foregoing risks have historically had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificantly increased volatility and instability and unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nIt is difficult for us, our customers and suppliers to forecast demand trends. We may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future business cycles generally, or specific to the markets in which we participate. In the first half of 2020, demand in the automotive market steeply declined as a result of manufacturing shutdowns by automotive OEMs due to the coronavirus pandemic, resulting in an unforeseen negative impact to our results of operations. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, demand rebounded across all end markets more quickly than anticipated and accelerated through the third quarter of 2022, resulting in our inability to fully satisfy customer demand. In 2008 and 2009, Europe, the United States and international markets experienced increased volatility and instability related to the global financial crisis. In the event of a future decline in global economic conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and the resulting economic decline might disproportionately affect the markets in which we participate, further exacerbating a decline in our results of operations.\n2 The contents of our website, our Corporate Sustainability Report, and our Sustainability Policy are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference into, and do not form a part of, this Form 10-K.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive. If we fail to introduce new technologies and products in a timely manner, this could adversely affect our business.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, short product lifecycles, significant price erosion and evolving standards. Accordingly, the success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new technologies and products that are ultimately successful in the market. The costs related to the research and development necessary to develop new technologies and products are significant and subject to increase due to current and expected inflation and any reduction of our research and development budget could harm our competitiveness. Meeting evolving industry requirements, including the increasing use of AI and machine learning technologies, and introducing new products to the market in a timely manner and at prices that are acceptable to our customers are significant factors in determining our competitiveness and success.\nIn addition, AI and machine learning are still in early stages, and the introduction and incorporation of AI technologies may result in unintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and liabilities. Such risks may include (i) adverse impacts from deficient, inaccurate, or biased AI recommendations, (ii) AI technologies the company develops and adopts may become obsolete earlier than planned, and there can be no assurance that the company will realize the desired or anticipated benefits, (iii) use of AI applications could increase the risk of cybersecurity incidents, such as through unintended or inadvertent transmission of proprietary or sensitive information, or (iv) any laws, regulations or industry standards adopted in response to the emergence of AI may be burdensome.\nCommitments to develop new products must be made well in advance of any resulting sales, and technologies and standards may change during development, potentially rendering our products outdated or noncompetitive before their introduction. If we are unable to successfully develop new products, our revenue may decline substantially. Moreover, some of our competitors are well-established entities, are larger than us and have greater resources than we do. If these competitors increase the resources they devote to developing and marketing their products, we may not be able to compete effectively. Any consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product offerings and financial resources, further strengthening their competitive position. In addition, some of our competitors operate in narrow business areas relative to us, allowing them to concentrate their research and development efforts directly on products and services for those areas, which may give them a competitive advantage. As a result of these competitive pressures, we may face declining sales volumes or lower prevailing prices for our products, and we may not be able to reduce our total costs in line with this declining revenue. If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for our products depends to a significant degree on the demand for our customers\u2019 end products.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is derived from sales to manufacturers in the automotive, industrial & IoT, mobile, and communication infrastructure. Demand in these markets fluctuates significantly, driven by consumer spending, consumer preferences, the development of new technologies and prevailing economic conditions. In addition, the specific products in which our semiconductors are incorporated may not be successful, or may experience price erosion or other competitive factors that affect the price manufacturers are willing to pay us. Such customers have in the past, and may in the future, vary order levels significantly from period to period, request postponements to scheduled delivery dates, modify their orders or reduce lead times. This is particularly common during periods of low demand. This can make managing our business difficult, as it limits the predictability of future revenue. It can also affect the accuracy of our financial forecasts. Furthermore, developing industry trends, such as customers\u2019 use of outsourcing and revised supply chain models, including the direct purchase of semiconductor products by end product manufacturers instead of component manufacturers, may affect our revenue, costs, customer relations and working capital requirements.\nIf customers do not purchase products made specifically for them, we may not be able to resell such products to other customers or may not be able to require the customers who have ordered these products to pay a cancellation fee. The foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry is historically characterized by continued price erosion, especially after a product has been on the market.\nOne of the results of the rapid innovation in the semiconductor industry is that pricing pressure, especially on products containing older technology, can be intense. Product life cycles are relatively short, and as a result, products tend to be replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes on a regular basis.\nIn turn, historically demand for older technology falls, causing the price at which such products can be sold to drop, in some cases precipitously. If this trend continues, in order to continue profitably supplying these products, we must reduce our production and procurement costs in line with the lower revenue we can expect to generate per unit. Usually, this must be accomplished through improvements in process technology, production efficiencies and efficient procurement pricing. If we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins, we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of these products. Moreover, we may not be able to cease production of such products, either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons, and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products. We cannot guarantee that competition in our core product markets will not lead to price erosion, lower revenue or lower margins in the future. Should reductions in our manufacturing costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to our business operations\nIn many of the market segments in which we compete, we depend on winning selection processes, and failure to be selected could adversely affect our business in those market segments.\nOne of our business strategies is to participate in and win competitive bid selection processes to develop products for use in our customers\u2019 equipment and products. These selection processes can be lengthy and require us to incur significant design and development expenditures, with no guarantee of winning a contract or generating revenue. Failure to win new design projects and delays in developing new products with anticipated technological advances or in commencing volume shipments of these products may have an adverse effect on our business. This risk is particularly pronounced in markets where there are only a few potential customers and in the automotive market, where, due to the longer design cycles involved, failure to win a design-in could prevent access to a customer for several years. Our failure to win a sufficient number of these bids could result in reduced revenue and hurt our competitive position in future selection processes because we may not be perceived as being a technology or industry leader, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur global business operations expose us to international business risks that could adversely affect our business.\nIf any of the following international business risks were to materialize or become worse, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022negative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments and international trade arrangements, such as the increase of barriers to international trade including the imposition of tariffs on imports by the United States and China, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, enhanced export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties and the sovereign debt crisis in certain European countries;\n\u2022social and political instability in a number of countries around the world, including continued hostilities in the Middle East and the armed conflict in Ukraine. The instability may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operations via our customers and global supply chain and volatility in energy prices and the financial markets;\n\u2022potential terrorist attacks;\n\u2022epidemics and pandemics, such as the coronavirus outbreak, which may adversely affect our workforce, as well as our suppliers and customers;\n\u2022geopolitical tension and disputes, as well as, resulting adverse changes in government policies, especially those affecting global trade and investment. Sustained geopolitical tensions, such as the current geopolitical tensions involving China and Taiwan, could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains and decoupling of global trade networks;\n\u2022volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular with respect to the U.S. dollar, and transfer restrictions, in particular in mainland China; and\n\u2022threats that our operations or property could be subject to nationalization and expropriation.\nIn addition, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has led to sanctions, export controls and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People\u2019s Republic. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military and economic actions and resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets. Further escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia could adversely impact the global supply chain, disrupt our operations, or negatively impact the demand for our products in our primary end markets. Any such disruption could result in an adverse impact to our financial results.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition. We review our goodwill and other intangible assets balance for impairment upon any indication of a potential impairment, and in the case of goodwill, at a minimum of once a year. Impairment may result from, among other things, a sustained decrease in share price, deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products and services we sell, challenges to the validity of certain registered intellectual property, reduced sales of certain products incorporating intellectual property and a variety of other factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations. Depending on future circumstances, it is possible that we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Any future determination of impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nIn difficult market conditions, our high fixed costs combined with low revenue may negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by high fixed costs and, notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, our production requirements are in part met by our own manufacturing facilities. In less favorable industry environments, like we faced in the first half of 2020, we are generally faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products. During such periods, our fabrication plants could operate at lower loading level, while the fixed costs associated with the full capacity continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.\nWe may from time to time restructure parts of our organization. Any such restructuring may impact customer satisfaction and the costs of implementation may be difficult to predict.\nWe have previously executed restructuring initiatives and continue to assess, restructure and make changes to parts of the processes in our organization. If the global economy remains volatile, our revenues could decline and we may be forced to take cost savings steps that could result in additional charges and materially affect our business. The costs of implementing any restructurings, changes or cost savings steps may differ from our estimates and any negative impacts on our revenues or otherwise of such restructurings, changes or steps, such as situations in which customer satisfaction is negatively impacted, may be larger than originally estimated.\nIf we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, if regular or statutory consultation processes with employee representatives such as works councils fail or are delayed, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe are a party to collective bargaining agreements and social plans with our labor unions. We are also required to consult with our employee representatives, such as works councils, on items such as restructurings, acquisitions and divestitures. Although we believe that our relations with our employees, employee representatives and unions are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate these agreements as they expire from time to time or to conclude the consultation processes in a timely and favorable way. The impact of future negotiations and consultation processes with employee\nrepresentatives could have a material impact on our financial results. Also, if we fail to extend or renegotiate our labor agreements and social plans, if significant disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage, we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to predict.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to predict and may fluctuate. The comparatively long period between the time at which we commence development of a product and the time at which it may be delivered to a customer leads to high inventory and work-in-progress levels. The volatility of our customers\u2019 own businesses and the time required to manufacture products also make it difficult to manage inventory levels and require us to stockpile products across many different specifications.\nOur business may be adversely affected by costs relating to product defects, and we could be faced with product liability and warranty claims.\nWe make highly complex electronic components and, accordingly, there is a risk that defects may occur in any of our products. Such defects can give rise to significant costs, including expenses relating to recalling products, replacing defective items, writing down defective inventory and loss of potential sales. In addition, the occurrence of such defects may give rise to product liability and warranty claims, including liability for damages caused by such defects. If we release defective products into the market, our reputation could suffer and we may lose sales opportunities and incur liability for damages. Moreover, since the cost of replacing defective semiconductor devices is often much higher than the value of the devices themselves, we may at times face damage claims from customers in excess of the amounts they pay us for our products, including consequential damages. We also face exposure to potential liability resulting from the fact that our customers typically integrate the semiconductors we sell into numerous consumer products, which are then sold into the marketplace. We are exposed to product liability claims if our semiconductors or the consumer products based on them malfunction and result in personal injury or death. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses relating to attorneys\u2019 fees and damages. In addition, our customers may recall their products if they prove to be defective or make compensatory payments in accordance with industry or business practice or in order to maintain good customer relationships. If such a recall or payment is caused by a defect in one of our products, our customers may seek to recover all or a portion of their losses from us. If any of these risks materialize, our reputation would be harmed and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.\nWe and third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our products and services. The same holds for the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them. Components and Intellectual Property (IP) we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. As we have become a more data-centric company, our processors and other products are being used in additional and new and critical application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity, privacy or safety risks. This includes applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Additionally, new information can subsequently develop that may impact our assessment of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants and evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products.\nSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, sales, branding, customer relationships, share price, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material.\nAdverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential\nvulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available. This, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation.\nOur business has suffered, and could in the future suffer, from manufacturing problems.\nWe manufacture, in our own factories as well as with third parties, our products using processes that are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must continuously be modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and, as a result of such problems, we may on occasion not be able to deliver products or do so in a timely or cost-effective or competitive manner. Such difficulties may include rationing, or other forced disruption of utility supplies such as electricity, gas or water by governments or regulators which could lead to disruptions of our operation resulting in high costs and global supply chain disruptions. As the complexity of both our products and our fabrication processes has become more advanced, manufacturing tolerances have been reduced and requirements for precision have become more demanding. As is common in the semiconductor industry, we have in the past experienced manufacturing difficulties that have given rise to delays in delivery and quality control problems. There can be no assurance that any such occurrence in the future would not materially harm our results of operations. Further, we may suffer disruptions in our manufacturing operations, either due to production difficulties such as those described above or as a result of external factors beyond our control, such as the disruption to our Austin, Texas manufacturing facilities caused by the February 2021 winter storm. We may, in the future, experience manufacturing difficulties or permanent or temporary loss of manufacturing capacity due to the preceding or other risks. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the timely supply of equipment and materials and could suffer if suppliers fail to meet their delivery obligations or raise prices. Certain equipment and materials needed in our manufacturing operations are only available from a limited number of suppliers.\nOur manufacturing operations depend on deliveries of equipment and materials in a timely manner and, in some cases, on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Supply disruptions may also occur due to shortages in critical materials, such as silicon wafers or specialized chemicals. Because the equipment that we purchase is complex, it is frequently difficult or impossible for us to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of quality equipment or materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of equipment or materials due to current or expected inflation or other reasons and we are not able to increase the price of our products.\nFailure of our third party suppliers to perform could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently use outside suppliers for a portion of our manufacturing capacity. Outsourcing our production presents a number of risks. If our outside suppliers are unable to satisfy our demand, or experience manufacturing difficulties, delays or reduced yields, our results of operations and ability to satisfy customer demand could suffer. For example, as part of the industry-wide shortage of semiconductors during 2022 we could not obtain sufficient silicon wafers from our foundry partners to meet the demand for our products, causing us to not fully supply the demand for our products, and negatively affecting our results of operations. In addition, purchasing rather than manufacturing these products may adversely affect our gross profit margin if the purchase costs of these products are higher than our own manufacturing costs would have been or if we are not able to increase the price of our products to reflect the higher input costs. Prices for foundry products also vary depending on capacity utilization rates at our suppliers, quantities demanded, product technology and geometry. Furthermore, these outsourcing costs can vary materially from quarter to quarter and, in cases of industry shortages like we experienced in 2022, they can increase significantly, which may negatively affect our gross profit if we are not able to increase the price of our products. In addition, we have entered into long term supply agreements with certain key manufacturing partners. The failure of these suppliers to perform under these agreements or an unexpected reduction in demand for these products could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in our relationships with any one of our key customers could adversely affect our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our top customers, including our distributors. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate similar levels of revenue from our largest customers in the future. If one or more of these customers substantially reduce their purchases from us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe receive subsidies and grants in certain countries, and a reduction in the amount of governmental funding available to us or demands for repayment could increase our costs and affect our results of operations.\nAs is the case with other large semiconductor companies, we receive subsidies and grants from governments in some countries. These programs are subject to periodic review by the relevant governments, and if any of these programs are curtailed or discontinued, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As the availability of government funding is outside our control, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to benefit from government support or that sufficient alternative funding will be available if we lose such support. Moreover, if we terminate any activities or operations, including strategic alliances or joint ventures, we may face adverse actions from the local governmental agencies providing such subsidies to us. In such event that we don't meet the subsidies grant conditions, such government agencies could seek to recover such subsidies from us and they could cancel or reduce other subsidies we receive from them. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain natural disasters, such as flooding, heavy precipitation, large earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, may negatively impact our business. Climate change may cause a rising number of natural disasters that could negatively affect our operations.\nEnvironmental and other disasters, such as flooding, heavy precipitation large earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, or a combination thereof may negatively impact our business. If flooding, heavy precipitation, a large earthquake, volcanic eruption or, extreme weather event or other natural disaster were to directly damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay new production and shipments of existing inventory or result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs, all of which would negatively impact our business. Even if our manufacturing facilities are not directly damaged, a large natural disaster may result in disruptions in distribution channels, supply chains, movement of goods and significant increases in the prices of raw materials used for our manufacturing process. For instance, the nuclear incident following the tsunami in Japan in 2011 impacted the supply chains of our customers and suppliers. Furthermore, any disaster affecting our customers (or their respective customers) may significantly negatively impact the demand for our products and our revenues. In addition, climate change could cause certain natural disasters, such as drought, wildfires, storms, flooding or rising sea levels, to occur more frequently or with greater intensity. Such natural disasters pose physical risks to our manufacturing, IT facilities or our suppliers\u2019 facilities, or could disrupt the availability of water and utilities necessary for the operation of our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers\u2019 facilities resulting in increased operating costs and business disruption, such as the disruption to our Austin, Texas manufacturing facilities caused by the February 2021 winter storm and weather-related disruption of water and utilities to these facilities. In addition, semiconductor manufacturing is a water-intensive process. Many of our manufacturing sites and those of our suppliers are located in semi-arid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts associated with evolving changes to the climate, which may lead to water scarcity. If we and our suppliers are not able to implement adequate water recycling and conservation measures or if the water scarcity in a particular region becomes acute and restricts the availability of water necessary for the operation of our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers\u2019 facilities, our business may be significantly negatively impacted.\nThe impact of any such natural disasters depends on the specific geographic circumstances but could be significant, as some of our factories are located in areas with known earthquake fault zones, flood or storm risks, including but not limited to Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia or Thailand. There is increasing concern that climate change is occurring that may cause a rising number of natural disasters with potentially dramatic effects on human activity. We cannot predict the economic impact, if any, of natural disasters or climate change.\nRisks related to regulatory or legal challenges\nAs our business is global, we need to comply with laws and regulations in countries across the world.\nWe operate globally, with manufacturing, assembly and testing facilities in several continents, and we market our products globally.\nAs a result, we are subject to environmental, data privacy, AI technologies, disclosure and reporting (including reporting of ESG-related data), labor and health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We are also required to obtain environmental permits and other authorizations or licenses from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. In the jurisdictions where we operate, we need to comply with differing standards and varying practices of regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative bodies.\nNo assurance can be given that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with the laws and regulations to which we are subject or that we have obtained or will obtain the permits and other authorizations or licenses that we need. If we violate or fail to comply with laws, regulations, permits and other authorizations or licenses, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Furthermore, if one or more of our customers are sanctioned by regulators for non-compliance with laws and regulations, we could experience a decrease in demand for our products. For example, import and export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, are complex, change frequently, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified in recent years. In October 2022, the U.S. imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to certain mainland Chinese technology companies and in October 2023, the Department of Commerce\u2019s revisited these controls, proposing further refinements, and is moving toward final rule making. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are required to suspend activities with certain customers or suppliers due to the current and future changes in regulations. In 2020, due to regulations imposed by the U.S. government, we ceased shipments of our products to Huawei pending approval of export licenses. Furthermore, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity, such as the EU General Data Privacy Regulation, are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In addition, governments are increasingly imposing restrictions on foreign investment in semiconductor businesses and technology, such as the Dutch foreign investment control regime, that may limit our ability to execute strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Compliance with, or changes in the interpretation of, existing regulations, the adoption of new regulations, changes in the oversight of our activities by governments or standard bodies or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such regulations, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nLegal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending in various jurisdictions. Due to the uncertainty inherent in litigation, it is difficult to predict the final outcome. An adverse outcome might affect our results of operations.\nWe and certain of our businesses are involved as plaintiffs or defendants in legal proceedings in various matters. For example, we are involved in legal proceedings claiming personal injuries to the children of former employees as a result of employees\u2019 alleged exposure to chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments operated by us or our former parent companies, Philips and Motorola. Furthermore, because we continue to utilize these clean rooms, we may become subject to future claims alleging personal injury that may lead to additional liability. A judgment against us or material defense cost could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and initiatives to address climate change.\nWe are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate, which govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or\nwill be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nAs with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property, we face inherent risks of environmental liability at our current and historical manufacturing facilities. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. Certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. While we do not expect that any contamination currently known to us will have a material adverse effect on our business, we cannot assure you that this is the case or that we will not discover new facts or conditions or that environmental laws or the enforcement of such laws will not change such that our liabilities would be increased significantly. In addition, we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. In summary, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, regulated materials, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nPublic and private initiatives to address climate change may result in an increase in the cost of production due to increase in the prices of energy, introduction of energy or carbon tax or the purchase of carbon offsets. A variety of regulatory developments have been introduced that focus on restricting or managing the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Enterprises may need to purchase at higher costs new equipment or raw materials with lower carbon footprints. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur expenses. New materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may become subject to regulation. These developments and further legislation that is likely to be enacted could affect our operations negatively. Changes in environmental regulations could increase our production and operational costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks related to cybersecurity and IT systems\nInterruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology applications, systems and networks to operate our business. The reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and software, and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs is critical to our business. Any significant interruption in our business applications, systems or networks, including but not limited to new system implementations, computer viruses, cyberattacks, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur computer systems and networks are subject to attempted security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents, which, if successful, could adversely impact our business.\nWe have, from time to time, experienced cyber-attacks attempting to obtain access to and misuse our computer systems and networks. Such incidents could result in the misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology, the compromise of personal and confidential information of our employees, customers or suppliers or interrupt our business. There can be no assurance that a breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future. We believe that we have a robust cybersecurity program that is aligned to international cybersecurity frameworks, and that we leverage industry best practices across people, processes and technologies in an attempt to mitigate cybersecurity threats. However, we cannot always anticipate, detect, repel or implement fully effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity threats, particularly because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving.\nIn the current environment, there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems, and those of customers, suppliers, and some of those attempts may be successful. Such breaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, misuse, loss, or\ndestruction of our, our customer, or other third party data or systems, theft of sensitive or confidential data including personal information (including personal data about our employees, customers or other third parties) and intellectual property, system disruptions, and denial of service. In the event of such breaches, we, our customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. We have identified instances of employee misappropriation or theft of certain proprietary technology by individuals who are no longer employed by NXP. In some cases, such misappropriation may result in the violation of applicable export control regulations, which we report to relevant authorities as appropriate. As of the date of this filing we do not believe that any such misappropriation or theft known to us has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or any material damage to us. However, there can be no assurance that these or other similar incidents will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future. Accordingly, as these threats become increasingly sophisticated and continue to develop and grow, we are actively adapting our security measures and we continue to increase the amount we allocate to implement, maintain and/or update security systems to protect our infrastructure, intellectual property and data. As a global enterprise, we could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection. Additionally cyber-attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to us, our customers, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, potential liability, and damage our reputation and affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers.\nRisks related to intellectual property\nWe rely to a significant extent on proprietary intellectual property. We may not be able to protect this intellectual property against improper use by our competitors or others.\nOur success and future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, our products, our proprietary designs and fabrication processes, and other intellectual property against misappropriation by others. We primarily rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our intellectual property. We may have difficulty obtaining patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary products, technology and intellectual property, and the patents and other intellectual property rights we receive may be insufficient to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial advantage. We may not obtain patent protection or secure other intellectual property rights in all the countries in which we operate, and under the laws of such countries, patents and other intellectual property rights may be or become unavailable or limited in scope. Even if new patents are issued, the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. In addition, any of our existing patents, and any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. The protection offered by intellectual property rights may be inadequate or weakened for reasons or circumstances that are out of our control. Further, our proprietary technology, designs and processes and other intellectual property may be vulnerable to disclosure or misappropriation by employees, contractors and other persons. It is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our proprietary technologies, our products, designs, processes and other intellectual property despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property. While we hold a significant number of patents, there can be no assurances that additional patents will be issued or that any rights granted under our patents will provide meaningful protection against misappropriation of our intellectual property. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. We may not have or pursue patents or pending applications in all the countries in which we operate corresponding to all of our primary patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, effective enforcement in some countries may not be available. In particular, intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in countries where the application and enforcement of the laws governing such rights may not have reached the same level as compared to other jurisdictions where we operate. Consequently, operating in some countries may subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our suppliers or other parties with whom we engage. There is no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights or have adequate legal recourse in the event that we seek legal or judicial enforcement of our intellectual property rights under the laws of such countries. Any inability on our part to adequately protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become party to intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs, pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.\nWe have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, communications alleging possible infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of others. Further, we may become involved in costly litigation brought against us regarding patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot obtain or take the view that we don\u2019t need a license, these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages (and potentially treble damages in the United States) or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted. Such lawsuits, if successful, could result in an increase in the costs of selling certain of our products, our having to partially or completely redesign our products or stop the sale of some of our products and could cause damage to our reputation. Any litigation could require significant financial and management resources regardless of the merits or outcome, and we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any litigation or that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products, could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to human capital management\nLoss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract such management and other personnel, could affect our business.\nWe depend on our key management to run our business and on our senior engineers to develop new products and technologies. Our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals. The loss of any of our key personnel, whether due to departures, death, ill health or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The market for qualified employees, including skilled engineers and other individuals with the required technical expertise to succeed in our business, is highly competitive and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate the additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities or develop marketable products. The foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to our corporate structure\nUnited States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, certain members of our board and officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon the U.S. laws.\nIn the absence of an applicable treaty for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters to which the United States and the Netherlands are a party, a judgment obtained against the Company in the courts of the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, including a judgment predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities law or securities laws of any State or territory within the United States, will not be directly enforceable in the Netherlands.\nIn order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent court of the Netherlands; the relevant Netherlands court has discretion to attach such weight to a judgment of the courts of the United States as it deems appropriate; based on case law, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected to recognize and grant permission for enforcement of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States without re-examination or relitigation of the substantive matters adjudicated thereby, provided that (i) the relevant court in the United States had jurisdiction in the matter in\naccordance with standards which are generally accepted internationally; (ii) the proceedings before that court complied with principles of proper procedure; (iii) recognition and/or enforcement of that judgment does not conflict with the public policy of the Netherlands; and (iv) recognition and/or enforcement of that judgment is not irreconcilable with a decision of a Dutch court rendered between the same parties or with an earlier decision of a foreign court rendered between the same parties in a dispute that is about the same subject matter and that is based on the same cause, provided that earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands.\nBased on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that U.S. investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors or officers who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters.\nIn addition, there is doubt as to whether a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors, our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts, respectively.\nWe are a Dutch public company with limited liability. The rights of our stockholders may be different from the rights of stockholders governed by the laws of U.S. jurisdictions.\nWe are a Dutch public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap). Our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of association and by the laws governing companies incorporated in the Netherlands. The rights of stockholders and the responsibilities of members of our board of directors may be different from the rights and obligations of stockholders in companies governed by the laws of U.S. jurisdictions. In the performance of its duties, our board of directors is required by Dutch law to consider the interests of our company, its stockholders, its employees and other stakeholders, in all cases with due observation of the principles of reasonableness and fairness. It is possible that some of these parties will have interests that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. See Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nOur debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount of $11,250 million. Our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business by:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates in the event we have borrowings under our $2,500 million revolving credit facility agreement (the \u201cRCF Agreement\u201d) because loans under the RCF Agreement bear interest at a variable rate;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event default under the indentures governing our notes and agreements governing other indebtedness;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financial for working capital, capital expenditures, restructurings, product development, research and development, debt service requirements, investments, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we may still incur significantly more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above and affect our ability to service and repay our debt.\nIf we do not comply with the covenants in our debt agreements or fail to generate sufficient cash to service and repay our debt, it could adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nThe RCF Agreement and the indentures governing our unsecured notes or any other debt arrangements that we may have require us to comply with various covenants. If there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness or reduce or delay capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and business plan. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nThe rating of our debt by major rating agencies may further improve or deteriorate, which could affect our additional borrowing capacity and financing costs.\nThe major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt. These ratings are based on current information furnished to the ratings agencies by us and information obtained by the ratings agencies from other sources. An explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect our market value and/or increase our corporate borrowing costs.\nGeneral risk factors\nThe price of our common stock historically has been volatile. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. The market price for our common stock has varied between a high of $238.27 on December 15, 2023 and a low of $153.10 on January 5, 2023 in the twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2023. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section, changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies, variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors, peer companies or suppliers regarding their own performance, or announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, joint marketing relationships or capital commitments, the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability. In the past, following periods of market volatility, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nWe may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\nThe amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchases may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes-such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments-and because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, and the market price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.\nOur board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our ordinary shares on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.\nFuture dividends, if any, and their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: management\u2019s views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; earnings levels; contractual restrictions; cash position and overall financial condition; and changes to our business model. The payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law, contractual restrictions and our corporate structure.\nThe impact of a negative performance of financial markets and demographic trends on our defined benefit pension liabilities and costs cannot be predicted.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans in a number of countries and a significant number of our employees are covered by our defined benefit pension plans. As of December 31, 2023, we had recognized a net accrued benefit liability of $392 million, representing the unfunded benefit obligations of our defined pension plans. The funding status and the liabilities and costs of maintaining these defined benefit pension plans may be impacted by financial market developments. For example, the accounting for such plans requires determining discount rates, expected rates of compensation and expected returns on plan assets, and any changes in these variables can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs. Negative performance of the financial markets could also have a material impact on funding requirements and net periodic pension costs. Our defined benefit pension plans may also be subject to demographic trends. Accordingly, our costs to meet pension liabilities going forward may be significantly higher than they are today, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nFuture changes to Dutch, U.S. and other foreign tax laws could adversely affect us.\nThe European Commission, U.S. Congress and Treasury Department, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations, particularly payments made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the European Union, U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect us and our affiliates.\nRecent examples include the OECD\u2019s initiatives to revise profit allocation and nexus rules to allocate more taxing rights to countries where companies have their markets and to establish a minimum tax rate on a global basis. As part of the OECD framework to implement a minimum tax rate, the EU has adopted a directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational companies, also known as Pillar 2, to become effective in 2024. The Dutch government has enacted new legislation in response to and based on such EU directive. It is anticipated that other countries will also introduce Pillar 2 legislation. These initiatives include recommendations and proposals that, if enacted in countries in which we and our affiliates do business, could adversely affect us and our affiliates. In addition, the Dutch government has enacted legislation to curtail exemptions on taxing share repurchases to become effective in 2025. If such legislation is not amended or repealed, this will lead to an additional out of pocket tax payment associated with future share repurchases. In addition, the U.S. may enact legislation that would allow a tax payer to deduct domestic R&D expenses in the year that they are expensed, which would adversely affect our tax rate, while beneficial for our cash position.\nWe are exposed to a number of different tax uncertainties, which could have an impact on our results.\nWe are required to pay taxes in multiple jurisdictions. We determine the taxes we are required to pay based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We may be subject to unfavorable changes in the respective tax laws and regulations to which we are subject. Tax controls, audits, change in controls and changes in tax laws or regulations or the interpretation given to them may expose us to negative tax consequences, including interest payments and potentially penalties. We have issued transfer-pricing directives in the areas of goods, services and financing, which are in accordance with OECD guidelines. As transfer pricing has a cross border effect, the focus of local tax authorities on implemented transfer pricing procedures in a country may have an impact on results in another country.\nTransfer pricing uncertainties can also result from disputes with local tax authorities about transfer pricing of internal deliveries of goods and services or related to financing, acquisitions and divestments, the use of tax credits and permanent establishments, and tax losses carried forward. These uncertainties may have a significant impact on local tax results. We also have various tax assets resulting from acquisitions. Tax assets can also result from the generation of tax losses in certain legal entities. Tax authorities may challenge these tax assets. In addition, the value of the tax assets resulting from tax losses carried forward depends on having sufficient taxable profits in the future.",

Cybersecurity\nNXP, similar to other semiconductor companies, operates in a complex and rapidly changing environment that involves many risks, including information and cybersecurity risks. As a leading technology company, we are committed to helping strengthen internet security and to implementing measures designed to protect our company against illicit activities, including cyberattacks and malware.\nOur management is directly responsible for executing the Company\u2019s risk management processes. Our Board is responsible for overseeing these risk management processes. In exercising its oversight, the Board and, as appropriate, the relevant Board committees, assesses the material risks facing the Company and evaluate management\u2019s plans for managing material risk exposures. The Company conducts a formal annual risk assessment to identify, analyze and report on enterprise risks. The results of this risk assessment are reported to and discussed with the Board.\nOur Board performs this oversight function through periodic reports from management and Board committees. While our Board generally has ultimate oversight responsibility of the Company\u2019s risk management processes, it has delegated to its committees the responsibility to oversee risk management processes associated with their respective areas of responsibility and expertise. The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of NXP\u2019s governance and management of IT risks, including those relating to business continuity, cybersecurity, malware, regulatory compliance and data management. NXP senior leadership regularly briefs the Audit Committee on cybersecurity matters and briefs the full Board on these issues at least annually or as needed.\nNXP\u2019s program for Information Technology (IT) Risk Management is a component of NXP\u2019s overall process for Enterprise Risk Management (\u201cERM\u201d).\nThe objectives of ERM are to:\n\u2022Identify our key risks in a timely manner, based upon quantitative and qualitative factors.\n\u2022Mitigate risk and keep risk impact at acceptable levels, particularly those risks that could result in a strategic impact event.\n\u2022Ensure there is an effective risk-management framework in place which covers our key risks and is supported by risk-monitoring mechanisms.\n\u2022Prioritize and align risk-management efforts, to use resources effectively.\n\u2022Ensure risk-management governance, including quarterly monitoring, reporting and evaluation.\nKey ERM activities include:\n\u2022Assessment (identification and evaluation of risks)\n\u2022Response (building capabilities, mitigation)\n\u2022Management Assurance (effective management methods, clear accountabilities)\n\u2022Monitoring (audit, inquire, verify)\n\u2022Communication (internally and externally)\n\u2022Periodically evaluate effectiveness method\nNXP\u2019s Chief Information Security Officer is primarily responsible for managing the cybersecurity risks identified in the ERM process. This includes performing risk assessments, prioritizing the most likely and impactful risk elements, and recommending appropriate measures to mitigate the risk.\nNXP\u2019s cybersecurity initiatives focus on strengthening our Core IT infrastructure and services against external threats, securing our manufacturing operations from compromise, limiting damage through processes and controls, and protecting our intellectual property. On a day-to-day basis, NXP identifies vulnerabilities, breach attempts, and possible criminal activity by external threat actors. Additionally, NXP has a supplier security framework that helps with monitoring and accessing the security of suppliers and third-party service providers. As part of the framework, we conduct due diligence which covers topics such as data protection, confidentiality, security, business continuity and incident management. These activities are covered by our process for cybersecurity risk management under our ERM.\nNXP uses a multi-layer approach to identify and mitigate information security risks. On a tactical level, NXP maintains a 24x7 Security Operating Center (SOC) that actively monitors for and identifies cyber security threats and initiates appropriate mitigation processes. The SOC reports to the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). When needed, a task force containing Security, IT, Communications, Legal and Business representatives is established. This task force leads mitigation activities where the potential threat or risk is elevated. In addition to SOC, the NXP IT Service Desk and NXP employees are trained to identify Cyber Security issues and to escalate them to correct owners. Furthermore, NXP has an Identify and Access Management System integrated with HR systems which helps manage employee life cycle processes, including both onboarding and offboarding NXP workers. These systems are audited by internal and external audit teams. On a strategic level, NXP\u2019s information technology risk management program is a component of the ERM process described above.\nNXP is certified and externally audited to ISO 27001 with certain additional certifications such as Common Criteria 6+, PCI DSS and GSMA Security for focused functions, and we maintain information security risk insurance coverage. We have multiple cybersecurity training initiatives as part of our information security training and compliance program. We regularly deploy simulated attacks and related trainings. We deliver a Cyber Security orientation to new employees and maintain a library of cyber security learning sessions available to our employees.\nTo date, we have experienced no cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected NXP, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. We do not believe that cybersecurity threats resulting from any previous cybersecurity incidents of which we are aware are reasonably likely to materially affect NXP. For additional information on certain risks associated with cybersecurity, refer to the risk factors set forth under the caption \u201cRisks related to cybersecurity and IT systems\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2023.\nOur MD&A is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. MD&A is organized as follows:\n\u2022Overview - Overall analysis of financial and other highlights to provide context for the MD&A\n\u2022Results of Operations - An analysis of our financial results\n\u2022Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - An analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows and a discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity\n\u2022Critical Accounting Estimates - Accounting estimates that management believes are the most important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our financial results and forecasts\n\u2022Use of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures - A discussion of the non-GAAP measures used\nNXP has one reportable segment representing the entity as a whole. Our segment represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segment.\nOverview\nRevenue for the year-ended ended December 31, 2023 was $13,276 million compared to $13,205 million for the year-ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $71 million or 0.5% year-on-year.\nOur gross profit percentage for 2023 and 2022 remained flat at 56.9%, as both revenue and cost of revenue were impacted by inflationary effect of increased input costs which were passed along to end customers.\nWe continue to generate strong operating cash flows, with $3,513 million in cash flows from operations for 2023. We returned $2,059 million to our shareholders during the year in dividends and repurchases of common stock. Our cash and short-term deposit position at the end of 2023 was $4,271 million.\nQ4 2023 compared to Q3 2023\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $3,422 million compared to $3,434 million for the three months ended October 1, 2023, a decrease of $12 million or 0.3% quarter-on-quarter. NXP experienced growth in the Industrial IoT end market of $55 million or 9.1%, Mobile end market of $29 million or 7.7%, and Automotive end market of $8 million or 0.4%. The positive trends were offset by declines in the Communications Infrastructure & Other end market of $104 million or 18.6%.\nWhen aggregating all end markets together and reviewing sales channel performance, revenues through NXP\u2019s third party distribution partners was $2,078 million, an increase of $131 million or 6.7% compared to the previous period. Revenues through NXP\u2019s third party direct OEM and EMS customers was $1,310 million, a decline of $153 million or 10.5% versus the previous period.\nFrom a geographic perspective, revenue increased across the China and the Americas regions. Offsetting the positive growth trends, were declines in revenues in the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions.\nThe gross profit percentage for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased to 56.6% from 57.2% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher restructuring costs for specific targeted actions under new global restructuring programs in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOperating cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $1,137 million compared to $988 million for the three months ended October 1, 2023, an increase of $149 million or 15.1% quarter-on-quarter. Under the financing section of the cash flow, there was a $409 million investment in short-term deposit that was made in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nQ4 2023 compared to Q4 2022\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $3,422 million compared to $3,312 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $110 million or 3.3% versus the year ago period. NXP experienced growth in its Automotive end market of $94 million or 5.2% and Industrial IoT end market of $57 million or 9.4% versus the year ago period. Offsetting these positive growth trends were declines of revenues in the Communication Infrastructure & Other end market of $39 million or 7.9% and the Mobile end market of $2 million or 0.5% versus the year ago period.\nWhen aggregating all end markets together, and reviewing sales channel performance, NXP\u2019s third party distribution partners was $2,078 million, an increase of $202 million or 10.8% versus the year ago period. Business transacted through direct OEM and EMS customers was $1,310 million, a decrease of $87 million or 6.2% versus the year ago period.\nFrom a geographic perspective, revenue increased across most regions, with declines in our Asia Pacific regions.\nThe gross profit percentage for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased to 56.6% from 57.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher restructuring costs for specific targeted actions under new global restructuring programs in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOperating cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $1,137 million compared to $1,076 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $61 million or 5.7% versus the\nyear ago period. Under the financing section of the cash flow, there was a $409 million investment in short-term deposit that was made in the fourth quarter of 2023. Dividends paid to common stockholders increased 18%, from $221 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the composition of operating income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year-ended December 31, 2023 was $13,276 million compared to $13,205 million for the year-ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $71 million or 0.5% year-on-year.\nRevenue by end market was as follows:\nRevenue by sales channel was as follows:\nRevenue by geographic region, which is based on the customer\u2019s shipped-to location, was as follows:\nn Automotive n Mobile n Distributors n Other\nn Industrial & IoT n Comm Infra & Other n OEM/EMS\nThe year-to-date change in revenue was due to a combination of higher average selling prices, offset by lower shipment volumes. The higher average selling prices at 8.1% of revenues or the year-ended December 31, 2023, were a result of increased inflationary input costs from NXP suppliers which were passed along to end customers. The lower shipment volumes at 7.6% of revenues for the year-ended December 31, 2023, were a result of cyclical headwinds, resulting in lower revenue in various end markets. The combination of these two effects resulted in a net increase of $71 million revenue. All end markets reflected declines in volume, offset by higher average selling prices in our Automotive, Industrial IoT, and Communication & Infra end markets.\nFrom an end market perspective, NXP experienced growth in its Automotive and Communication Infrastructure & Other end markets which were offset by declines in the Industrial IoT and the Mobile end markets versus the year ago period.\nRevenue in the Automotive end market was $7,484 million, an increase of $605 million or 8.8% versus the year ago period. Within the Automotive end market our processor, advanced analog and connectivity products contributed to the growth, with offsets in our ADAS - Safety products.\nRevenue in the Industrial & IoT end market was $2,351 million, a decrease of $362 million or 13.3% versus the year ago period. Within the Industrial & IoT end market the year-to-date decline was across the entire product portfolio.\nRevenue in the Mobile end market was $1,327 million, a decrease of $280 million or 17.4% versus the year ago period. Within the Mobile end market revenue our advanced analog and mobile wallet products caused the decline.\nRevenue in the Communication Infrastructure & Other end market was $2,114 million, an increase of $108 million or 5.4% versus the year ago period. Within the Communication Infrastructure & Other end market our secure cards and processors products contributed to the growth, with offsets in our RF power and connectivity products.\nWhen aggregating all end markets together, and reviewing sales channel performance, revenues through NXP\u2019s third party distribution partners was $7,195 million, a decrease of 0.9% versus the year ago period. Revenues through direct OEM and EMS customers was $5,963 million, an increase of 3.3% versus the year ago period.\nFrom a geographic perspective, revenue increased in the EMEA and Americas regions and declined in the China and Asia Pacific regions versus the year ago period.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year-ended December 31, 2023 was $7,553 million, or 56.9% of revenue, compared to $7,517 million, or 56.9% of revenue, with inflationary effects of increased input costs from suppliers passed along to end customer resulting in a relatively flat gross margin year on year.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year-ended December 31, 2023 totaled $3,877 million, or 29.2% of revenue, compared to $3,723 million, or 28.2% of revenue, for the year-ended December 31, 2022.\n\u2022Research and development\nResearch and development (R&D) costs primarily consist of engineer salaries and wages (including share based compensation and other variable compensation), engineering related costs (including outside services, fixed-asset, IP and other licenses related costs), shared service center costs and other pre-production related expenses.\nR&D costs for the year-ended December 31, 2023 increased by $270 million, or 12.6%, when compared to last year primarily driven by higher personnel-related costs of $269 million (including engineer salaries and wages of $169 million, higher restructuring costs of $59 million, mainly personnel related costs for specific targeted actions under new global programs, and higher share-based compensation costs of $27 million), partly offset by higher received government assistance due to subsidies and R&D tax credits of $33 million.\n\u2022Selling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs primarily consist of personnel salaries and wages (including share based compensation and other variable compensation), communication and IT related costs, fixed-asset related costs and sales and marketing costs (including travel expenses).\nSG&A costs for the year-ended December 31, 2023 increased by $93 million, or 8.7%, when compared to last year primarily driven by higher personnel-related costs of $60 million (including personnel salaries and wages of $28 million and higher restructuring costs of $28 million, mainly personnel related costs for specific targeted actions under new global programs) and higher legal expenses of $25 million (related to ongoing litigation, including the Impinj Patent Litigation).\n\u2022Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets decreased by $209 million, or 41.1%, when compared to last year mainly as the effect of fully amortized acquisition-related intangibles during 2022 (with regard to the former Freescale acquisition).\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) includes results from manufacturing service arrangements (\u201cMSA\u201d) and transitional service arrangements (\u201cTSA\u201d) that are put into place when we divest a business or activity, as well as other activity. These arrangements are expected to decrease as the divested business or activity becomes more established. Other income (expense) reflects a loss of $15 million for 2023, compared to an income of $3 million in 2022.\nFinancial Income (Expense)\nFinancial income (expense) was an expense of $309 million in 2023, compared to an expense of $434 million in 2022. The change in financial income (expense) is attributable to an increase in interest income of $126 million as a result of higher interest rates and to a lesser extent by a higher level of cash, and no debt extinguishment costs in 2023 (2022: $18 million). Interest expense increased slightly by $11 million as a result of financing activities in fiscal year 2022 including the issuance of debt.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $523 million for the year-ended December 31, 2023, which reflects an effective tax rate of 15.6% compared to an expense of $529 million (15.7%) for the year-ended December 31, 2022.\nThe effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives, a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the Netherlands statutory tax rate, changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes, change in valuation allowance non-deductible expenses and withholding taxes. The impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods, with the significant drivers outlined below:\n\u2022The Company benefits from certain tax incentives, which reduce the effective tax rate. The dollar amount of the incentive in any given year is commensurate with the taxable income in that same period. In 2023, the foreign tax incentives are lower compared to 2022 primarily due to less qualifying investments.\n\u2022The higher favorable changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes in 2023 is primarily as a result of new guidance released by the Internal Revenue Service to clarify the treatment of specified research and experimental expenditures under Section 174.\n\u2022The other differences tax expense in 2023 and 2022 are mainly relating to excess tax benefits, unrecognized tax benefits, FX-effects and taxes due on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions in U.S. GILTI is recognized as a current period expense when incurred.\nResults Relating to Equity-accounted Investees\nResults relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a loss of $7 million in 2023, whereas in 2022 results relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a loss of $1 million.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are related to the third-party share in the results of consolidated companies, predominantly SSMC. Their share of non-controlling interests amounted to a profit of $25 million for the year-ended December 31, 2023, compared to a profit of $46 million for the year-ended December 31, 2022.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations. We continue to generate strong positive operating cash flows, and we currently use cash to fund operations, meet working capital requirements, for capital expenditures and for potential common stock repurchases, dividends and strategic investments. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our current available sources of funds (including cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, RCF Agreement, plus anticipated cash generated from operations) will be adequate to finance our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and potential dividends for at least the next year.\nCash and short-term deposits\nAs of December 31, 2023, our cash and short-term deposit balance was $4,271 million, an increase of $426 million compared to December 31, 2022 ($3,845 million), of which $214 million (2022, $227 million) was held by SSMC, our consolidated joint venture company with TSMC. Under the terms of our joint venture agreement with TSMC, a portion of this cash can be distributed by way of a dividend to us, but 38.8% of the dividend will be paid to our joint venture partner. During 2023 and 2022, no dividend was declared. Taking into account the available undrawn amount of the RCF Agreement of $2,500 million, we had access to $6,771 million of liquidity as of December 31, 2023.\nCapital return\nThe common stock repurchase activity was as follows:\nUnder Dutch corporate law and our articles of association, NXP may acquire its own shares if the general meeting of shareholders has granted the board of directors the authority to effect such acquisitions. It is our standard practice to request our annual general meeting of shareholders (the \u201cAGM\u201d) every year to renew this authorization for a period of 18 months from the AGM. For repurchases of shares in 2022 and 2023, the board of directors made use of the authorizations renewed by the AGM on May 26, 2021, June 1, 2022 and May 24, 2023, respectively. Our board of directors has approved the purchase of shares from participants in NXP's equity programs to satisfy participants' tax withholding obligations (\"trade for tax\") and this authorization will remain in effect until terminated by the board of directors. In March 2021, the board of directors approved the additional repurchase of shares up to a maximum of $2 billion (the \"2021 Share Repurchase Program\"), and in August 2021, the board of directors increased the 2021 Share Repurchase Program authorization by $2 billion, for a total of $4 billion approved for the repurchase of shares under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program. In January 2022,\nthe board of directors approved the additional repurchase of shares up to a maximum of $2 billion (the \"2022 Share Repurchase Program\"). During the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2022, NXP repurchased 8.3 million shares, for a total of approximately $1.4 billion under the trade for tax and 2021 Share Repurchase Program and during the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2023, NXP repurchased 5.5 million shares, for a total of approximately $1 billion under the trade for tax 2021 and 2022 Share Repurchase Program. Under Dutch tax law, the repurchase of a company\u2019s shares by an entity domiciled in the Netherlands results in a taxable event (unless exemptions apply). The tax on the repurchased shares is attributed to the shareholders, with NXP making the payment on the shareholders\u2019 behalf. As such, the tax on the repurchased shares is accounted for within stockholders\u2019 equity.\nSubject to Dutch corporate law and our articles of association, the board of directors of NXP may cancel shares acquired if authorized by the general meeting of shareholders. As with repurchases of our shares, it is our standard practice to request our annual general meeting of shareholders (the \u201cAGM\u201d) every year to renew this authorization for a period of 18 months from the AGM. The board of directors did not make use of the authorization during the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2023.\nUnder our Quarterly Dividend Program, interim dividends of $0.845 per ordinary share were paid on April 6, July 6, October 6, 2022 and January 6, 2023; and dividends of $1.014 were paid on April 5, July 6, October 5, 2023 and January 5, 2024.\nDebt\nOur total debt, inclusive of aggregate principal, unamortized discounts, premiums, debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments, amounted to $11,175 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $10 million compared to December 31, 2022 ($11,165 million).\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $11,250 million (collectively the \u201cNotes\u201d), with $1,000 million payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $3,135 million, with $402 million payable within 12 months.\nThe Company had a net debt position (see section Use of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures) at December 31, 2023 of $6,904 million compared to $7,320 million as of December 31, 2022.\nAdditional capital requirements\nWe believe our current positions in cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, together with our expected cash flow generated from operations and our expected financing activities will satisfy our working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our current business plans. Recent and expected working and other capital requirements, in addition to the above matters, also include the items described below:\n\u2022The Company maintains purchase commitments with certain suppliers, primarily for raw materials, semi-finished goods and manufacturing services and for some non-production items. Purchase commitments for inventory materials are generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary for different suppliers. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had purchase commitments of $4,184 million, of which $1,026 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. We expect operating cash outflows to remain elevated as we make payments under these purchase agreements.\n\u2022Amounts related to future lease payments for operating lease obligations at December 31, 2023 totaled $299 million, with $64 million expected to be paid within the next 12 months.\n\u2022The Company enters into certain technology license arrangements which are used in conjunction with research and development activities for product development. Payments for these technology licenses are made over varying time periods. Outstanding unpaid balances for technology licenses total $159 million as of December 31, 2023, of which $127 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.\n\u2022The Company has committed to invest approximately $550 million in the newly founded European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) GmbH, over the coming five years, of which approximately $83 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.\n\u2022Cash outflows for capital expenditures were $827 million in 2023, compared to $1,063 million in 2022. We expect to maintain similar levels of capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue in 2024, to support current and future manufacturing and production capacity needs.\n\u2022Our research and development expenditures were $2,418 million in 2023 and $2,148 million in 2022, and we expect to maintain similar levels of investment in research and development as a percentage of revenue in 2024.\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents and short term deposits, or require us to arrange for new debt and equity financing to fund the transaction. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or we may not have enough capacity under the RCF Agreement, or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including the RCF Agreement, the unsecured notes or to fund our other liquidity needs, including working capital and capital expenditure requirements. In any such case, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n2023 Financing Activities\nThere were no significant financing activities during 2023.\n2022 Financing Activities\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn August 26, 2022, NXP B.V., together with NXP Funding LLC, amended and restated its revolving credit agreement entered into on June 11, 2019. The amended and restated revolving credit agreement provides for $2.5 billion of senior unsecured revolving credit commitments and is scheduled to mature on August 26, 2027.\nExchange Offers\nOn April 14, 2022, we initiated a registered exchange offering of our outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes for new issues of substantially identical registered debt securities (the \u201cExchange Offers\u201d). The Exchange Offers expired on May 16, 2022, at which time substantially all of the Notes were exchanged for registered senior unsecured notes.\nDebt Issuance and redemption\nOn May 16, 2022, NXP B.V., together with NXP Funding LLC and NXP USA, Inc., issued $500 million of 4.4% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2027 and $1 billion of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2033. On May 27, 2022 we redeemed the $900 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding dollar-denominated 4.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2023 in accordance with the terms of the indenture.\nDebt Position\nShort-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $1,000 million short-term debt outstanding (December 31, 2022: no short-term debt outstanding).\nLong-term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding debt of:\n(1) On December 6, 2018, we issued $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.35% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.55% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028.\n(2) On May 1, 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.7% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.15% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.4% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2030.\n(3) On June 18, 2019, we issued $750 million of 3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 and $1 billion of 4.3% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029.\n(4) On May 11, 2021, we issued $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2031 and $1,000 million aggregated principal amount of 3.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2041.\n(5) On November 30, 2021, we issued $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 2.65% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2032, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2042 and $500 million aggregated principal amount of 3.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2051.\n(6) On May 16, 2022, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.4% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 and $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2033.\n(7) On August 26, 2022, we entered into a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility agreement.\nWe may from time to time continue to seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. See the discussion in Part II, Item 7. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nCash flows\nOur cash and cash equivalents in 2023 increased by $15 million (excluding the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash position of $2 million) as follows:\n\u2022Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2023 our operating activities provided $3,513 million in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $2,822 million, adjustments to reconcile the net income of $1,265 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(594) million. Adjustments to net income include offsetting non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $1,106 million, share-based compensation of $411 million, a loss on equity securities of $1 million, results relating to equity-accounted investees of $7 million and changes in deferred taxes of $(267) million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a $353 million increase in inventories due to improved supply capabilities, $138 million increase in receivables and other current assets from prepayments to secure production supply with multiple vendors, and $119 million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of timing related to payments.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2022 our operating activities provided $3,895 million in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $2,833 million, adjustments to reconcile the net income of $1,410 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(372) million. Adjustments to net income include offsetting non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $1,250 million, share-based compensation of $364 million, amortization of the discount on debt and debt issuance costs of $9 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $18 million, a loss on equity securities of $4 million, results relating to equity-accounted investees of $1 million and changes in deferred taxes of $(236) million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a $593 million increase in inventories due increased production levels in order to align inventory on hand with expected demand, $106 million increase in receivables and other current assets from the accumulation of insignificant increases in numerous asset accounts within the \"other\" classification, and $633 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of the increase of trade accounts payable to meet the increase in growth in our business and timing related to payments.\n\u2022Cash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $1,508 million for the year-ended December 31, 2023 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for capital expenditures of $827 million, $409 investments in short-term deposits, $179 million for the purchase of identified intangible assets, and $94 million for the purchase of investments.\nNet cash used for investing activities amounted to $1,249 million for the year-ended December 31, 2022 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for capital expenditures of $1,063 million, $159 million for the purchase of identified intangible assets, $5 million for the purchase of equipment leased to others, $27 million purchases of interests in businesses (net of cash acquired), and $20 million purchase of investments, partly offset\nby $10 million from proceeds from return of equity investments and $13 million from proceeds from sale of investments.\n\u2022Cash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities was $1,990 million for the year-ended December 31, 2023. This was primarily driven by the dividend payment to common stockholders of $1006 million, and purchase of treasury shares and restricted stock unit holdings of $1,053 million; partially offset by the $71 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock through stock plans.\nNet cash used for financing activities was $1,619 million for the year-ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily driven by purchase of treasury shares and restricted stock unit holdings of $1,426 million, repurchase of long-term debt of $917 million, the dividend payment to common stockholders of $815 million, cash paid for debt issuance costs of $14 million; partially offset by the $1,496 million proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $59 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock through stock plans.\nInformation Regarding Guarantors of NXP (unaudited)\nSummarized Combined Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries\nAll debt instruments are guaranteed, fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, by NXP Semiconductors N.V. and issued or guaranteed by NXP USA, Inc., NXP B.V. and NXP LLC, (together, the \u201cSubsidiary Obligors\u201d and together with NXP Semiconductors N.V., the \u201cObligor Group\u201d). Other than the Subsidiary Obligors, none of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries (together the \u201cNon-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d) guarantee the Notes. The Company consolidates the Subsidiary Obligors in its consolidated financial statements and each of the Subsidiary Obligors are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nAll of the existing guarantees by the Company rank equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior indebtedness of the Obligor Group. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Obligor Group to obtain funds from respective subsidiaries by dividend or loan.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of the Obligor Group on a combined basis, with intercompany balances and transactions between entities of the Obligor Group eliminated and investments and equity in the earnings of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries excluded. The Obligor Group\u2019s amounts due from, amounts due to, and intercompany transactions with Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries have been disclosed below the table, when material.\nSummarized Statements of Income\nSummarized Balance Sheets\nNXP Semiconductors N.V. is the head of a fiscal unity for the corporate income tax and VAT that contains the most significant Dutch wholly-owned group companies. The Company is therefore jointly and severally liable for the tax liabilities of the tax entity as a whole, and as such the income tax expense of the Dutch fiscal unity has been included in the Net income of the Obligor Group.\nThe financial information of the Obligor Group includes sales executed through a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary single-billing entity as a sales agent on behalf of an entity in the Obligor Group. The Obligor Group has sales to non-guarantors (2023: $792 million). The Obligor Group has amounts due from equity financing (2023: $5,441 million) and due to debt financing (2023: $2,346 million) with non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nRecent Legislation\nPillar Two\nMany countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. Pillar Two legislation, focused on implementing a global minimum corporate tax, has been enacted in certain jurisdictions the Company operates. The legislation will be effective for the Company\u2019s financial year beginning January 1, 2024. The Company is in scope of the enacted legislation and has performed an assessment of the Company\u2019s potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the Company\u2019s forecast for financial year-ended December 31, 2024 in combination with the most recent tax filings and country-by-country reporting for the constituent entities of the Company. Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions that the Company operates in are above 15%. However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief does not apply and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to 15%. The Company does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two in those jurisdictions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of our accounting policies\nrequire us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include:\n\u2022the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;\n\u2022the assessment of recoverability of goodwill, identified intangible assets and tangible fixed assets, which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization;\n\u2022revenue recognition, which impacts our results of operations;\n\u2022the recognition of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impacts our provision for income taxes;\n\u2022the assumptions used in the determination of postretirement benefit obligations, which impacts operating expenses;\n\u2022the assumptions used in the determination of share based compensation, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses; and\n\u2022the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency or revise the estimates for a loss contingency.\nIn the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We regularly review our inventories and write down our inventories for estimated losses due to obsolescence. This allowance is determined for groups of products based on sales of our products in the recent past and/or expected future demand. Future demand is affected by market conditions, technological obsolescence, new products and strategic plans, each of which is subject to change with little or no forewarning. In estimating obsolescence, we utilize information that includes projecting future demand.\nThe need for strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers are balanced against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.\nThe change in our reserves for inventories was primarily due to the normal review and accrual of obsolete or excess inventory. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is required to be assessed for impairment at least once annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. Such events or changes in circumstances can be significant changes in business climate, operating performance or competition, or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. We perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions. We base our fair-value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing.\nWe perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that the fair value exceeded the recorded value for the respective reporting unit.\nImpairment or disposal of identified long-lived assets\nWe perform reviews of long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than what we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Impairment losses, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\nThe assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe vast majority of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors, Original Equipment Manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) and similar customers. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. Variable consideration is estimated and includes the impact of discounts, price protection, product returns and distributor incentive programs. The estimate of variable consideration is dependent on a variety of factors, including contractual terms, analysis of historical data, current economic conditions, industry demand and both the current and forecasted pricing environments. The estimate of variable consideration is not typically constrained because the Company has extensive experience with these contracts.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company\u2019s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment. In determining whether control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title, and whether risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer.\nFor sales to distributors, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to the distributor. For some distributors, contractual arrangements are in place which allow these distributors to return products if certain conditions are met. These conditions generally relate to the time period during which a return is allowed and reflect customary conditions in the particular geographic market. Other return conditions relate to circumstances arising at the end of a product life cycle, when certain distributors are permitted to return products purchased during a pre-defined period after the Company has announced a product\u2019s pending discontinuance. These return rights are a form of variable consideration and are estimated using the most likely method based on historical return rates in order to reduce revenues recognized. However, long notice periods associated with these announcements prevent significant amounts of product from being returned. For sales where return rights exist, the Company has determined, based on historical data, that only a small percentage of the sales of this type to distributors is actually returned. Repurchase agreements with OEMs or distributors are not entered into by the Company.\nSales to most distributors are made under programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities. These programs may include credits granted to distributors, or allow distributors to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor, or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory. In determining the transaction price, the Company considers the price adjustments from these programs to be variable consideration that reduce the amount of revenue recognized. The Company\u2019s policy is to estimate such price adjustments using the most likely method based on rolling historical experience rates, as well as a prospective view of products and pricing in the distribution channel for distributors who participate in our volume rebate incentive program. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in pricing environments and inventory levels. The estimates are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity. Historically, actual price adjustments for these programs relative to those estimated have not materially differed.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes on dividends from subsidiaries are recognized in situations where the Company does not consider the earnings indefinitely reinvested and to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable.\nDeferred tax assets, including assets arising from loss carryforwards, are recognized, net of a valuation allowance, if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.\nThe income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. The income tax benefit recognized is measured based on the largest benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon resolution of the uncertainty. Unrecognized tax benefits are presented as a reduction to the deferred tax asset for related temporary differences, tax credits or net operating loss carryforwards, unless these would not be available, in which case the uncertain tax benefits are presented together with the related interest and penalties as a liability, under accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities based on the timing of the expected payment. Related penalties are recorded as income tax expense, whereas related interest is reported as financial expense in the statement of operations.\nPostretirement benefits\nThe Company\u2019s employees participate in pension and other postretirement benefit plans in many countries. The costs of pension and other postretirement benefits and related assets and liabilities with respect to the Company\u2019s employees participating in defined benefit plans are based upon actuarial valuations.\nThe projected defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. For the Company\u2019s major plans, the discount rate is derived from market yields on high quality corporate bonds. Plans in countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local government bond rates.\nIn calculating obligation and expense, the Company is required to select actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation costs determined based on current market conditions, historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries. Changes in the key assumptions can have a significant impact to the projected benefit obligations, funding requirements and periodic pension cost incurred.\nThe Company determines the fair value of plan assets based on quoted prices or comparable prices for non-quoted assets. For a defined benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement defined benefit plan it is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.\nShare-based compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards based on the grant-date estimated fair values, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. Share-based compensation cost for restricted share units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) with time-based vesting is measured based on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant, reduced by the present value of the estimated expected future dividends, and then multiplied by the number of RSUs granted. Share-based compensation cost for performance-based share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) granted with performance or market conditions is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.\nOur valuation models and generally accepted valuation techniques require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, employee turnover rates and employee stock option exercise behaviors. When establishing the expected life assumption, we used the \u2018simplified\u2019 method prescribed in ASC Topic 718 for companies that do not have adequate historical data. The risk-free interest rate is measured as the prevailing yield for a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity similar to the expected life assumption. We also estimate a forfeiture rate at the time of grant and revise this rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from the original estimates.\nWe evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellation of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense.\nLitigation and claims\nWe are regularly involved as plaintiffs or defendants in claims and litigation related to our past and current business operations. The claims can cover a broad range of topics, including intellectual property, reflecting the Company\u2019s identity as a global manufacturing and technology business. The Company vigorously defends itself against improper claims, including those asserted in litigation. Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s accruals will be sufficient to cover the extent of its potential exposure to losses but, historically, legal actions have not had a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based on currently available information in relation to the claims that have arisen and on the Company\u2019s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain claims, the Company believes that an estimate cannot currently be made. The estimated aggregate range requires significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages), the existence of multiple defendants (including the Company) in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the claims, and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate.\nUse of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this document contains references to net debt. Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total debt (short-term and long-term) after deduction of cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits. We believe this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to calculating our net leverage.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net debt to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, total debt, as adjusted for our cash and cash equivalents our net debt was calculated as follows:\nWe understand that, although net debt is used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies, this concept has limitations as an analytical tool and it should not be used as an alternative to any other measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through fixed and variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies. Changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBy using derivative instruments, we are subject to credit and market risk. The fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves, as well as foreign exchange and commodity spot and forward rates, and reflects the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting period. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, thus creating a receivable risk for us. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. We minimize counterparty credit (or repayment) risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. Our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur RCF Agreement has a $2,500 million borrowing capacity with a floating rate interest. As there are currently no borrowings under this facility, a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have caused any change to our interest expense on our floating rate debt.\nAdditional information regarding our notes is provided in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 13 - Debt, of our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference.\nForeign Currency Risks\nWe are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could affect operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows. We monitor our exposures to these market risks and generally employ operating and financing activities to offset these exposures where appropriate. If we do not have operating or financing activities to sufficiently offset these exposures, from time to time, we may employ derivative financial instruments such as swaps, collars, forwards, options or other instruments to limit the volatility to earnings and cash flows generated by these exposures. Derivative financial instruments are only used for hedging purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes. All counterparties to our derivatives contracts are major banking institutions. In the event of financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligation to us, which could have a negative impact on our results. The Company measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values derived from market\nprices of the instruments or from option pricing models, as appropriate and record these as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair values are recognized in the statement of operations immediately unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied. A summary of our foreign currency accounting policies is provided in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, of our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference.\nAt December 31, 2023 our net asset related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on certain operating expenditure transactions was $3 million. If our forecasted operating expenditures for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in our hedged foreign currency, we would incur a negligible loss.\nFinancial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments.\nOur primary foreign currency exposure relates to the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. However, our foreign currency exposures also relate, but are not limited, to the Chinese Yuan, the India Rupee, the Japanese Yen, the Malaysian Ringgit, the Romanian Leu, the Singapore Dollar, the New Taiwan Dollar, the Thai Baht and the Swiss Franc.",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue recognition - Variable consideration under the distributor incentive programs\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue is recorded for customers based on the amount that is expected to be collected, which considers whether the price is subject to a refund or adjustment. This variable consideration is estimated and reflects the impact of distributor incentive programs. The Company\u2019s policy is to estimate such variable consideration using the most likely amount method, which takes into account the contractual terms, historical experience of rebate rates, as well as a prospective view of products and pricing for distributors who participate in a distributor incentive program.\nAuditing management\u2019s estimate of variable consideration under the distributor incentive programs is complex, due to the uncertainty inherent to the estimate, the application of management judgment, and the significant assumptions as noted above utilized in estimating the variable consideration.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company\u2019s process for estimating the variable consideration of the distributor incentive programs. For example, we tested controls over management\u2019s review of the assumptions used, results of calculations and assessment of the underlying data.\nTo test management's estimate of the variable consideration of the distributor incentive programs, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the estimation methodology used, the significant assumptions described above, and the underlying data used by the Company. We evaluated the estimation methodology used by management against the requirements of ASC 606 and industry practice. To evaluate the significant assumptions used by management, we compared them to the forecasted pricing environment, as well as to historical results and practices of the Company. Our audit procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of data inputs used by the Company included vouching distributor inventory on hand, rebate rates used and amounts of unclaimed distributor resales to contractual agreements, external confirmations and historical price and claim data, as appropriate. We recalculated the estimate using management\u2019s model. We also assessed the accuracy of management\u2019s estimates by testing a sample of actual claimed allowances subsequent to year-end, against the period-end estimate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young Accountants LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2020.\nEindhoven, the Netherlands\nFebruary 22, 2024\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of NXP Semiconductors N.V.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited NXP Semiconductors N.V. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, NXP Semiconductors N.V. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d) and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young Accountants LLP\nEindhoven, the Netherlands\nFebruary 22, 2024\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n* Reclassification adjustments included in Cost of revenue, Selling, general and administrative, Research and development and Results relating to equity-accounted investees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nSee accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nAll amounts in millions of $ unless otherwise stated\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Overview\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Net income (loss) includes the portion of the earnings of subsidiaries applicable to non-controlling interests. The income (loss) and equity attributable to non-controlling interests are disclosed separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under non-controlling interests. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.\nSegment reporting\nNXP has one reportable segment representing the entity as a whole and reflects the way in which our chief operating decision maker executes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the Company.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe vast majority of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors, Original Equipment Manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) and similar customers. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. Variable consideration is estimated and includes the impact of discounts, price protection, product returns and distributor incentive programs. The estimate of variable consideration is dependent on a variety of factors, including contractual terms, analysis of historical data, current economic conditions, industry demand and both the current and forecasted pricing environments. The process of evaluating these factors is subjective and requires estimates including, but not limited to, forecasted demand, returns, pricing assumptions and inventory levels. The estimate of variable consideration is not typically constrained because the Company has extensive experience with these contracts.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company\u2019s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment. In determining whether control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title, and whether risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer.\nThe Company applies the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed. The Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.\nFor sales to distributors, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to the distributor. For some distributors, contractual arrangements are in place which allow these distributors to return products if certain conditions are met. These conditions generally relate to the time period during which a return is allowed and reflect customary conditions in the particular geographic market. Other return conditions relate to circumstances arising at the end of a product life cycle, when certain distributors are permitted to return products purchased during a pre-defined period after the Company has announced a product\u2019s pending discontinuance. These return rights are a form of variable consideration and are estimated using the most likely method based on historical return rates in order to reduce revenues recognized. However, long notice periods associated with these announcements prevent significant amounts of product from being returned. For sales where return rights exist, the Company has determined, based on historical data, that only a small percentage of the sales of this type to distributors is actually returned. Repurchase agreements with OEMs or distributors are not entered into by the Company.\nSales to most distributors are made under programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities. These programs may include credits granted to distributors, or allow distributors to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor, or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory. In determining the transaction price, the Company considers the price adjustments from these programs to be variable consideration that reduce the amount of revenue recognized. The Company\u2019s policy is to estimate such price adjustments using the most likely method based on rolling historical experience rates, as well as a prospective view of products and pricing in the distribution channel for distributors who participate in our volume rebate incentive program. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in pricing environments and inventory levels. The estimates are also adjusted when recent historical data does not represent anticipated future activity. Historically, actual price adjustments for these programs relative to those estimated have not materially differed.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at acquisition that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at face value which approximates fair value. Short-term deposits representing cash equivalents with original maturity beyond three months are reported as current assets in the line \u201cShort-term deposits\u201d of the consolidated balance sheets.\nReceivables\nReceivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowances for credit loss and net of rebates and other contingent discounts granted to distributors. When circumstances indicate a specific customer\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligation to us is impaired, we record an allowance against amounts due and value the receivable at the amount reasonably expected to be collected. For all other customers, we evaluate our trade accounts receivable risk of credit loss based on numerous factors including historical loss rates, credit-risk concentration, and specific circumstances such as serious adverse economic conditions in a specific country or region.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. An allowance is made for the estimated losses due to obsolescence. This allowance is determined for groups of products based on purchases in the recent past and/or expected future demand and market conditions. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expense and waste are not capitalized in inventory. The allocation of fixed production overheads to the inventory cost is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.\nGovernment assistance\nGovernment grants, other than those relating to purchases of assets, are recognized as a reduction of expenditure as qualified expenditures are made.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Government investment grants are deducted from the cost of the related asset. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected economic life of the asset. Depreciation of special tooling is also based on the straight-line method unless a depreciation method other than the straight-line method better represents the consumption pattern. Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in other income and expense. Plant and equipment under finance leases are initially recorded at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value of minimum lease payments. These assets and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the arrangement. Once it is determined that an arrangement is, or contains, a lease, that determination should only be reassessed if the legal arrangement is modified. Changes to assumptions such as market-based factors do not trigger a reassessment. Determining whether a contract contains a lease requires judgment. In general, arrangements are considered to be a lease when all of the following apply:\n-It conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration;\n-We have substantially all economic benefits from the use of the asset; and\n-We can direct the use of the identified asset\nThe terms of a lease arrangement determine how a lease is classified and the resulting income statement recognition. When the terms of a lease effectively transfer control of the underlying asset, the lease represents an in substance financed purchase (sale) of an asset and the lease is classified as a finance lease by the lessee and a sales-type lease by the lessor. When a lease does not effectively transfer control of the underlying asset to the lessee, but the lessor obtains a guarantee for the value of the asset from a third party, the lessor would classify a lease as a direct financing lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\nWith the exception of eight instances (with a combined value of $61 million), the Company\u2019s lease arrangements are all operating leases.\nLease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at January 1, 2019, the date of the adoption of ASC 842, or commencement date, if later, in determining the present value of future payments. The lease payments that are included in the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate; amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; the exercise price of a purchase option that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise; and payments for terminating the lease unless it is reasonably certain that early termination will not occur. The lease ROU asset includes any lease payment made and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms include the non-cancelable period for which a lessee has the right to use an underlying asset, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and the periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nFor operating leases, the lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the consolidated statement of operations over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The finance lease asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. Except for gas and chemical contracts, NXP did not make the election to treat the lease and non-lease components as a single component, and considers the non-lease components as a separate unit of account.\nEquity investments\nNXP\u2019s equity investments include equity method investments, marketable equity investments and non-marketable equity investments.\nEquity method investments: NXP\u2019s investments over which it has significant influence, but not control are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the NXP\u2019s share of net assets of the equity accounted investee since the acquisition date. NXP\u2019s share of the results of operations of the equity accounted investees are recognized in \u2018Results relating to equity-accounted investees\u2019.\nMarketable equity investments: all equity investments with a readily determinable fair value, other than equity-method investments, in unconsolidated entities are measured at fair value through earnings in the statement of operations on a recurring basis. We classify marketable securities as current or non-current based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. Gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in \u2018Financial income (expense)\u2019.\nNon-marketable equity investments: all equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, other than equity-method investments, in unconsolidated entities are recorded at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in \u2018Financial income (expense)\u2019.\nWe monitor our equity method investments and non-marketable equity securities for events or changes in circumstances which may indicate the investments are impaired. If an assessment indicates an investment is impaired, we recognize a charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value. For equity method investments, we record impairment losses in earnings only when impairments are considered other-than-temporary.\nBusiness combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates and judgments that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of acquired intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. Further judgment is required in estimating the fair values of deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date, as well as inventory, property, plant and equipment, pre-existing liabilities or legal claims and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable.\nThe fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies as well as the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected revenue growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. As such, acquired tangible and identified intangible assets are classified as Level 3 assets. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nGoodwill\nWe record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. We assign the goodwill to our reporting unit based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. We perform an impairment assessment at least once annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. We perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary. The reporting unit\u2019s carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments and debt.\nIdentified intangible assets\nLicensed technology and patents are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods of benefit. We amortize all acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit. Acquisition-related in-process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these assets are not subject to amortization. Assets related to projects that have been completed are subject to amortization, while assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired and expensed to R&D.\nWe perform an impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets at least once annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If necessary, a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.\nImpairment or disposal of identified long-lived assets\nWe perform reviews of long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, ROU assets, and intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than what we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Impairment losses, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If an asset\u2019s useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\nFair value measurements\nFair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for an identical asset or liability, we develop assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, utilize internal information that we consider to be consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. Priority is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs form the basis for the following fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u2022Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and valuations based on models where the inputs or significant value drivers are observable, either directly or indirectly.\n\u2022Level 3: Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\nForeign currencies\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency. The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. For consolidation purposes, the financial statements of the entities within the Company with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rates on the applicable balance sheet dates. Income and expense items in the statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows are translated at monthly exchange rates in the periods involved.\nThe effects of translating the financial position and results of operations from functional currencies to reporting currency are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders\u2019 equity. If the operation is a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is recorded under non-controlling interests.\nThe following table sets out the exchange rates for U.S. dollars from euros applicable for translation of NXP\u2019s financial statements for the periods specified.\n(1) The average of the noon-buying rate at the end of each fiscal month during the period presented.\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or the date of valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of operations, except when the foreign exchange exposure is part of a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge accounting relationship, in which case the related foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective and presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders\u2019 equity. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognized in the statement of operations. Currency gains and losses on intercompany loans that have the nature of a permanent investment are recognized as translation differences in other comprehensive income and are presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity.\nDerivative financial instruments including hedge accounting\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in the management of its foreign currency risks and the input costs of gold for a portion of our anticipated purchases within the next 12 months.\nThe Company measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values derived from market prices of the instruments or from option pricing models, as appropriate, and records these as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair values are immediately recognized in the statement of operations unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied. The cash flows associated with these derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged transaction.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. The cash flows associated with these derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged transaction. The application of cash flow hedge accounting for foreign currency risks is limited to transactions that represent a substantial currency risk that could materially affect the financial position of the Company.\nForeign currency gains or losses arising from the translation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that the hedge is effective, and are presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders\u2019 equity.\nTo the extent that a hedge is ineffective, the ineffective portion of the fair value change is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the corresponding amount in the accumulated other comprehensive income is transferred to the statement of operations as part of the profit or loss on disposal.\nOn initial designation of the hedge relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, the Company documents this relationship, including the risk management objectives, strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction and the hedged risk, and the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Company makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments are expected to be \u201chighly effective\u201d in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items attributable to the hedged risk.\nWhen cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because it is not probable that a forecasted transaction will occur within a period of two months from the originally forecasted transaction date, the Company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings. In situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the Company continues to carry the derivative at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings.\nThe gross notional amounts of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives by currency for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were as follows:\nDividends to shareholders\nDividends to the Company\u2019s shareholders are charged to retained earnings when the dividends are approved.\nStock repurchases and retirement\nFor each repurchase of common stock, the number of shares and the acquisition price for those shares is added to the existing treasury stock count and total value. When treasury shares are retired, the Company's policy is to allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired to both Retained Earnings and Capital in Excess of Par. The portion allocated to Capital in Excess of Par is calculated by applying a percentage, determined by dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares issued, to the balance of Capital in Excess of Par as of the retirement date.\nResearch and development\nCosts of research and development (R&D) are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for in-process research and development (IPR&D) assets acquired in business combinations, which are capitalized and, after completion, are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred.\nDebt issuance costs\nDirect costs incurred to obtain financings are capitalized and subsequently amortized over the term of the debt using the effective interest rate method. Upon extinguishment of any related debt, any unamortized debt issuance costs are expensed immediately.\nRestructuring\nThe provision for restructuring relates to the estimated costs of initiated restructurings that have been approved by Management. When such plans require discontinuance and/or closure of lines of activities, the anticipated costs of closure or discontinuance are recorded at fair value when the liability has been incurred. The Company determines the fair value based on discounted projected cash flows in the absence of other observable inputs such as quoted prices. The restructuring liability includes the estimated cost of termination benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement, costs to terminate leases and other contracts, and selling costs associated with assets held for sale and other costs related to the closure of facilities. One-time employee termination benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period when those employees are required to render services to the Company, if that period exceeds 60 days or a longer legal notification period. However, generally, employee termination benefits are covered by a contract or an ongoing benefit arrangement and are recognized when it is probable that the employees will be entitled to the benefits and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) primarily consists of gains and losses related to divestment of activities and subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses related to the sale of long-lived assets and other non-core operating items. This includes income derived from manufacturing service arrangements (\u201cMSA\u201d) and transitional service arrangements (\u201cTSA\u201d) that are put in place when we divest a business or activity as well as related expenditures.\nFinancial income and expense\nFinancial income and expense is comprised of interest income on cash and cash equivalent balances, the interest expense on borrowings, the accretion of the discount or premium on issued debt, the gain or loss on the disposal of financial assets, impairment losses on financial assets and gains or losses on hedging instruments recognized in the statement of operations.\nBorrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of operations using the effective interest method.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax liabilities for income taxes or withholding taxes on dividends from subsidiaries are recognized in situations where the Company does not consider the earnings indefinitely reinvested and to the extent that the withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable.\nDeferred tax assets, including assets arising from loss carryforwards, are recognized, net of a valuation allowance, if based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.\nThe income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. The income tax benefit recognized is measured based on the largest benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon resolution of the uncertainty. A liability for unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest and penalties is recorded under accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the balance sheet based on the timing of the expected payment. Penalties related to income taxes are recorded as income tax expense, whereas interest is reported as financial expense in the statement of operations.\nPillar Two legislation, focused on implementing a global minimum corporate tax, has been enacted in certain jurisdictions the Company operates. The legislation will be effective for the Company\u2019s financial year beginning January 1, 2024. The Company is in scope of the enacted legislation and has performed an assessment of the Company\u2019s potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the Company\u2019s forecast for financial year-ended December 31, 2024 in combination with the most recent tax filings and country-by-country reporting for the constituent entities of the Company. Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions that the Company operates in are above 15%. However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief does not apply and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to 15%. The Company does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two in those jurisdictions.\nPostretirement benefits\nThe Company\u2019s employees participate in pension and other postretirement benefit plans in many countries. The costs of pension and other postretirement benefits and related assets and liabilities with respect to the Company\u2019s employees participating in the various plans are based upon actuarial valuations.\nSome of the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plans are funded with plan assets that have been segregated and restricted in a trust, foundation or insurance company to provide for the pension benefits to which the Company has committed itself.\nThe net liability or asset recognized in the balance sheet in respect of the postretirement plans is the present value of the projected benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date. Most of the Company\u2019s plans are unfunded and result in a provision or a net liability.\nFor the Company\u2019s major plans, the discount rate is derived from market yields on high quality corporate bonds. Plans in countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local government bond rates.\nBenefit plan costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of the expected return on plan assets and net of employee contributions.\nActuarial gains and losses arise mainly from changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. They are recognized in the statement of operations, over the expected average remaining service periods of the employees only to the extent that their net cumulative amount exceeds 10% of the greater of the present value of the obligation or of the fair value of plan assets at the end of the previous year (the corridor). Events which invoke a curtailment or a settlement of a benefit plan will be recognized in our statement of operations.\nIn calculating obligation and expense, the Company is required to select actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, assumed health care trend rates and rates of increase in compensation costs determined based on current market conditions, historical\ninformation and consultation with and input from our actuaries. Changes in the key assumptions can have a significant impact to the projected benefit obligations, funding requirements and periodic cost incurred.\nUnrecognized prior-service costs related to the plans are amortized to the statements of operations over the average remaining service period of the active employees.\nContributions to defined contribution and multi-employer pension plans are recognized as an expense in the statements of operations as incurred.\nThe Company determines the fair value of plan assets based on quoted prices or comparable prices for non-quoted assets. For a defined benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement defined benefit plan it is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.\nThe Company recognizes as a component of other comprehensive income, net of taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs that arise during the year but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, including the gains or losses and the prior services costs are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs.\nFor all the Company\u2019s postretirement benefit plans, the measurement date is December 31, our year-end.\nShare-based compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards based on the grant-date estimated fair values, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. NXP\u2019s grants through the incentive plan are equity settled. Share-based compensation cost for restricted share units (\u201cRSU\u201ds) with time-based vesting is measured based on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant, reduced by the present value of the estimated expected future dividends, and then multiplied by the number of RSUs granted. Share-based compensation cost for performance-based share units (\u201cPSU\u201ds) granted with performance or market conditions is measured using a Monte-Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.\nThe value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For stock options, PSUs and RSUs, the grant-date value, less estimated pre-vest forfeitures, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The vesting period for stock options is generally four years, for RSUs and PSUs it is generally three years.\nEarnings per share\nBasic earnings per share attributable to stockholders is calculated by dividing net income or loss attributable to stockholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\nTo determine diluted share count, we apply the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of outstanding stock option shares, RSUs, PSUs, Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) shares and MT Annual Incentive Plan. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising share-based awards and the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\nConcentration of risk\nFinancial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, that may potentially subject NXP to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, short-term investments, long-term investments, accounts receivable and forward contracts.\nWe sell our products to OEMs and to distributors in various markets, who resell these products to OEMs or to their subcontract manufacturers. One of our distributors accounted for 21% of our revenue in 2023, 20% in 2022 and 18% in 2021. No other distributor accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue for 2023, 2022 or 2021. No individual OEM for which we had direct sales to accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nCredit exposure related to NXP\u2019s foreign currency forward contracts is limited to the realized and unrealized gains on these contracts.\nThe Company uses outside suppliers or foundries for a portion of its manufacturing capacity.\nWe have operations in Europe and Asia subject to collective bargaining agreements which could pose a risk to the Company but we do not expect that our operations will be disrupted if such is the case.\nRecent accounting standards\nNew Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures to improve disclosure requirements on reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard requires interim and annual disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, requires disclosure of the position and title of the CODM, requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by this ASU and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280, and contains other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 require greater disaggregation of income tax disclosures related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. In addition, the amendments require disclosure of income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and, disclosure of income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nNo other new accounting pronouncements were issued or became effective in the period that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 3 - Acquisitions and Divestments\nThere were no material acquisitions or divestments during 2023.\nOn July 19, 2022, we acquired PL Sense for a total consideration of $22.1 million, net of closing adjustments.\nOn July 6, 2021, we acquired Retune DSP for a total consideration of $15.7 million, net of closing adjustments.\nNote 4 - Supplemental Financial Information\nStatement of Operations Information\nDisaggregation of revenue\nThe following table presents revenue disaggregated by sales channel:\nGovernment assistance\nThe Company primarily benefits from country specific R&D tax credits (\"RTC\") (for the period ending December 31, 2023: $80 million) as well as direct grants in different jurisdictions (for the period ending December 31, 2023: $43 million).\nThe grants recorded in operating income are included in the following line items in the statement of operations:\nThe classification of the grants' related assets and liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:\nThe duration of our RTC is indefinite while subject to future policy changes in the respective countries. RTC amounts received are subject to regular audits by the relevant governments. RTC receivables are, depending on their jurisdiction, settled against income or payroll taxes, or paid in cash within a maximum period of three years.\nOur direct grants include those awarded under the European 2nd Important Project of Common European Interest on Microelectronics and Communication Technologies (\u201cIPCEI ME/CT\u201d). During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company was granted IPCEI ME/CT government assistance in multiple EU member states. The duration of the IPCEI ME/CT grants is planned to run until the end of 2029. The conditions to receive the IPCEI ME/CT government assistance include restrictions on eligible expenditures, employment retention, annual budget appropriations by the member states, compliance with member states\u2019 regulations and project objectives and results, as well as repayment conditions.\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment\nDepreciation and amortization, including impairment charges, are as follows:\n(*) For the period ending December 31, 2021, the amount includes an impairment charge as a result of the discontinuation of an IPR&D project for an amount of $36 million.\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment is primarily included in cost of revenue.\nOther income (expense)\nIncome derived from manufacturing service arrangements (\u201cMSA\u201d) and transitional service arrangements (\u201cTSA\u201d) that are put in place when we divest a business or activity, is included in other income (expense). These arrangements are expected to decrease as the divested business or activity becomes more established.\nThe following table presents the split of other income (expense):\nFinancial income (expense)\nBalance Sheet Information\nCash and cash equivalents\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our cash balance was $3,862 million and $3,845 million, respectively, of which $214 million and $227 million was held by SSMC, our consolidated joint venture company with TSMC. Under the terms of our joint venture agreement with TSMC, a portion of this cash can be distributed by way of a dividend to us, but 38.8% of the dividend will be paid to our joint venture partner. During 2023 and 2022, no dividend was paid by SSMC.\nEquity Investments\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total carrying value of investments in equity securities is summarized as follows:\nThe total carrying value of investments in equity-accounted investees is summarized as follows:\nResults related to equity-accounted investees at the end of each period were as follows:\nOther current liabilities\nOther current liabilities at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 consisted of the following:\nWe have reclassified certain amounts related to customer programs previously presented in \u201cAccounts payable\u201d to \u201cOther current liabilities\u201d as of December 31, 2022 to conform to current period presentation as follows:\nNote 5 - Restructuring Charges\nAt each reporting date, we evaluate our restructuring liabilities, which consist primarily of termination benefits, to ensure that our accruals are still appropriate. The restructuring charges for 2023 consist of $106 million for personnel related costs for specific targeted actions under new global restructuring programs, offset by an $8 million release for an earlier program. During 2022 and 2021, there were no new significant restructuring programs.\nThe following table presents the changes in the position of restructuring liabilities in 2023:\n(1) Other changes primarily related to translation differences.\nThe total restructuring liability as of December 31, 2023 of $101 million is classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under current liabilities ($92 million) and non-current liabilities ($9 million).\nThe utilization of the restructuring liabilities mainly reflects the execution of ongoing restructuring programs the Company initiated in earlier years.\nThe following table presents the changes in the position of restructuring liabilities in 2022:\n(1) Other changes primarily related to translation differences.\nThe total restructuring liability as of December 31, 2022 of $20 million is classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under current liabilities ($19 million) and non-current liabilities ($1 million).\nThe utilization of the restructuring liabilities mainly reflects the execution of ongoing restructuring programs the Company initiated in earlier years.\nThe components of restructuring charges recorded in 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nThe restructuring charges recorded in operating income are included in the following line items in the statement of operations:\nNote 6 - Income Taxes\nIn 2023, NXP generated income before income taxes of $3,352 million (2022: income of $3,363 million; 2021: income of $2,180 million). The components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows:\nThe components of income tax benefit (expense) are as follows:\nA reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate in the Netherlands as a percentage of income (loss) before income taxes and the effective income tax rate is as follows:\n.\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $523 million in 2023, which reflects an effective tax rate of 15.6% compared to an expense of $529 million and an effective rate of 15.7% in 2022. The effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives, a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the Netherlands statutory tax rate, changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes, change in valuation allowance, non-deductible expenses and withholding taxes. The impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods, with the significant drivers outlined below:\n\u2022The Company benefits from certain tax incentives, which reduce the effective tax rate. The dollar amount of the incentive in any given year is commensurate with the taxable income in that same period. In 2023, the foreign tax incentives are lower compared to 2022 primarily due to less qualifying investments. For 2022, the foreign tax and Netherlands tax incentives were higher than 2021 by $147 million, mainly due to the fact that NXP benefited from higher qualifying income and also taking into account the effect of specific U.S. tax law that became effective as from 2022.\n\u2022The movement in the valuation allowance was mostly due to new Dutch corporate income tax law applicable as from 2019. A portion of the interest expenses is non-deductible in the year it is recorded but can be carried forward without expiration. The release of the valuation allowance in 2021 is due to higher qualifying income compared to 2020 and 2019.\n\u2022The higher favorable changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes in 2023 is primarily as a result of new guidance released by the Internal Revenue Service to clarify the treatment of specified research and experimental expenditures under Section 174.\n\u2022The movement in the withholding taxes in 2022 as compared to 2021 is mainly due to considering more undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in 2021, resulting in a 2021 tax benefit of $17 million.\n\u2022The other differences tax expense in 2023 and 2022 are mainly relating to excess tax benefits, unrecognized tax benefits, FX-effects and taxes due on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions in U.S. compared to the same period in 2021. GILTI is recognized as a current period expense when incurred.\nThe Company benefits from income tax holidays in certain jurisdictions which provide that we pay reduced income taxes in those jurisdictions for a fixed period of time that varies depending on the jurisdiction. The predominant income tax holiday is expected to expire at the end of 2026. The impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign income taxes by $13 million in 2023 (2022: $17 million; 2021: $14 million). The benefit of this tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was $0.05 in 2023 (2022: $0.07; 2021: $0.05).\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities\nThe principal components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:\nThe classification of the deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:\nThe Company has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that may reduce taxable income or income taxes payable in future periods. Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets based on a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d threshold. The realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance decreased by $10 million during 2023 (2022: $7 million decrease). Besides the net change in the valuation allowance of $3 million this mainly includes a decrease of the valuation allowance due to expiration of tax attributes for $4 million and for the remainder due to changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes.\nWe consider all available evidence in forming a judgment regarding the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023, including events that occur subsequent to year end but prior to the issuance of the financial statements. The deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that we consider it more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including reversal of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nAt December 31, 2023 tax loss carryforwards of $398 million (inclusive of $79 million of U.S. state tax losses) will expire as follows:\nThis overview is excluding carried forward tax incentives of $130 million which have an unlimited expiration date.\nThe Company also has tax credit carryforwards of $227 million (excluding the effect of unrecognized tax benefits), which are available to offset future tax, if any, and which will expire as follows:\nThe net income tax payable (excluding the liability for unrecognized tax benefits) as of December 31, 2023 amounted to $117 million (2022: net income tax payable of $268 million) and includes amounts directly receivable from or payable to tax authorities.\nThe Company does not indefinitely reinvest the majority of the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries. Consequently, the Company has recognized a deferred tax liability of $36 million at December 31, 2023 (2022: $33 million) for the additional income taxes and withholding taxes payable upon the future remittances of these earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company considers $614 million of the undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested although the timing of the reversal can be controlled. Upon repatriation of those earnings, the Company would be subject to tax of $54 million, which is not recognized as deferred tax liability at December 31, 2023.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties is as follows:\nOf the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2023, $165 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. All other unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate as these would be offset by compensating adjustments in the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets that would be subject to valuation allowance based on conditions existing at the reporting date.\nThe Company classifies interest related to an underpayment of income taxes as financial expense and penalties as income tax expense. The total related interest and penalties recorded during the year 2023 amounted\nto a $16 million expense (2022: $1 million expense; 2021: $5 million expense). As of December 31, 2023, the Company has recognized a liability for related interest and penalties of $32 million (2022: $16 million; 2021: $18 million). It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may significantly increase/decrease within the next 12 months of the reporting date due to, for example, completion of tax examinations. It is estimated that this reasonably possible change will not be significant.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the Netherlands, the United States of America and in various other foreign jurisdictions. Tax filings of our subsidiaries are routinely audited in the normal course of business by tax authorities around the world. Tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions: the Netherlands (2018, 2020-2022), Germany (2017-2022), USA (2005-2022), China (2013-2022), Taiwan (2018-2022), Thailand (2018-2022), Malaysia (2016-2022) and India (2004, 2006-2022).\nNote 7 - Accounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable, net are summarized as follows:\nThe following table presents accounts receivable, net disaggregated by sales channel:\nNote 8 - Inventories, net\nInventories are summarized as follows:\nThe portion of finished goods stored at customer locations under consignment amounted to $11 million as of December 31, 2023 (2022: $8 million).\nThe amounts recorded above are net of an allowance for obsolescence of $189 million as of December 31, 2023 (2022: $125 million).\nNote 9 - Property, Plant and Equipment, net\nThe following table presents details of the Company\u2019s property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation:\nNote 10 - Identified Intangible Assets\nThe changes in identified intangible assets were as follows:\nIdentified intangible assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively were composed of the following:\n(1) IPR&D is not subject to amortization until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development effort.\nThe estimated amortization expense for these identified intangible assets for each of the five succeeding years is:\nAll intangible assets, excluding IPR&D and goodwill, are subject to amortization and have no assumed residual value.\nThe expected weighted average remaining life of identified intangibles is 4 years as of December 31, 2023.\nNote 11 - Goodwill\nThe changes in goodwill in 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nNo goodwill impairment charges were required to be recognized in 2023 or 2022.\nThe fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit.\nSee Note 3, \u201cAcquisitions and Divestments.\u201d\nNote 12 - Postretirement Benefit Plans\nPensions\nOur employees participate in employee pension plans in accordance with legal requirements, customs and the related matters in the respective countries. These are defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and multi-employer plans.\nThe Company\u2019s employees in The Netherlands participate in a multi-employer plan, implemented for the employees of the Metal and Electrical Engineering Industry (\"Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds Metalektro\" or \"PME\") in accordance with the mandatory affiliation to PME effective for the industry in which NXP operates. As this affiliation is a legal requirement for the Metal and Electrical Engineering Industry, it has no expiration date. This PME multi-employer plan (a career average plan) covers 1,527 companies and 612,500 participants. The plan monitors its risk on an aggregate basis, not by company or participant and can therefore not be accounted for as a defined benefit plan. The pension fund rules state that the only obligation for affiliated companies will be to pay the annual plan contributions. There is no obligation for affiliated companies to fund plan deficits. Affiliated companies are also not entitled to any possible surpluses in the pension fund.\nEvery participating company contributes the same fixed percentage of its total pension base, being pensionable salary minus an individual offset. The Company\u2019s pension cost for any period is the amount of contributions due for that period.\nThe contribution rate for the mandatory scheme will remain 27.98% in 2024, same as 2023.\nThe amount for pension costs included in the statement of operations for the year 2023 was $123 million (2022: $116 million; 2021: $112 million) of which $69 million (2022: $62 million; 2021: $52 million) represents defined contribution plans and $30 million (2022: $27 million; 2021: $32 million) represents the PME multi-employer plans.\nDefined benefit plans\nThe benefits provided by defined benefit plans are based on employees\u2019 years of service and compensation levels. Contributions are made by the Company, as necessary, to provide assets sufficient to meet the benefits payable to defined benefit pension plan participants.\nThese contributions are determined based upon various factors, including funded status, legal and tax considerations as well as local customs. The Company funds certain defined benefit pension plans as claims are incurred.\nThe total ongoing cost of defined benefit plans amounted to $24 million in 2023 (2022: a cost of $27 million; 2021: a cost of $28 million).\nThe table below provides a summary of the changes in the pension benefit obligations and defined benefit pension plan assets for 2023 and 2022, associated with the Company\u2019s dedicated plans, and a reconciliation of the funded status of these plans to the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe net amount of projected benefit obligation and plan assets for all underfunded (including unfunded) pension plans was $392 million and $335 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was classified as liabilities and non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, actuarial losses were primarily related to decreases in discount rates of approximately 10 basis points on a weighted basis and experience losses related to salary and pension indexation adjustments being higher than our long-term assumptions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, actuarial gains were primarily related to increases in discount rates of approximately 200 basis points on a weighted basis and updates to mortality table benchmarks in various countries.\nThe weighted average assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations were as follows:\nThe weighted average assumptions used to calculate the net periodic pension cost were as follows:\nFor the Company\u2019s major plans, the discount rate used is based on high quality corporate bonds (iBoxx Corporate Euro AA 10+).\nPlans in certain Asian countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local sovereign rate and the plans' maturities (Bloomberg Government Bond Yields).\nExpected returns per asset class are based on the assumption that asset valuations tend to return to their respective long-term equilibria. The Expected Return on Assets for any funded plan equals the average of the expected returns per asset class weighted by their portfolio weights in accordance with the fund\u2019s strategic asset allocation.\nThe components of net periodic pension costs were as follows:\nThe components of net periodic pension cost other than the service cost component are included in Other financial income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nPlan assets\nThe actual pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nWe met our target plan asset allocation. The investment objectives for the pension plan assets are designed to generate returns that, along with the future contributions, will enable the pension plans to meet their future obligations. The investments in our major defined benefit plans largely consist of government bonds, \u201cLevel 2\u201d Corporate Bonds and cash to mitigate the risk of interest fluctuations. The asset mix of equity, bonds, cash and other categories is evaluated by an asset-liability modeling study for our largest plan. The assets of funded plans in other countries mostly have a large proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are\naligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. Total pension plan assets of $213 million include $175 million related to the German and Japanese pension funds.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of these assets.\nThe Company currently expects to make $15 million of employer contributions to defined benefit pension plans and $11 million of expected cash payments in relation to unfunded pension plans in 2024.\nEstimated future pension benefit payments\nThe following benefit payments are expected to be made (including those for funded plans):\nPostretirement health care benefits\nIn addition to providing pension benefits, NXP provides retiree healthcare benefits in the U.S. which are accounted for as defined benefit plans.\nThe accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at the end of 2023 equals $2 million (2022: $3 million).\nNote 13 - Debt\nLong-term debt\nThe following table summarizes the outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(1)We do not have any borrowings under the $2,500 million RCF as of December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the following principal amounts of long-term debt are due in the next 5 years:\nAs of December 31, 2023, the book value of our outstanding long-term debt was $11,250 million, less debt issuance costs of $44 million and original issuance/debt discount of $31 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had no aggregate principal amount of variable interest rate indebtedness under our loan agreements. The remaining tenor of unsecured debt is on average 7.7 years.\nAccrued interest as of December 31, 2023 is $90 million (December 31, 2022: $99 million).\n2023 Financing Activities\nThere were no significant financing activities during 2023.\nCertain terms and Covenants of the notes\nThe Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes.\nThe indentures governing the notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company\u2019s ability and that of restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; enter into agreements that restrict dividends from restricted subsidiaries; sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; and effect a consolidation or merger. The Company has been in compliance with any such indentures and financing covenants.\nNo portion of long-term and short-term debt as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 has been secured by collateral on substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets and of certain of its subsidiaries.\nWe are in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of December 31, 2023.\nNote 14 - Leases\nOperating and finance lease assets relate to buildings (corporate offices, research and development and manufacturing facilities and datacenters), land, machinery and installations and other equipment (vehicles and certain office equipment). These leases, except for land leases, have remaining lease terms of 1 to 11 years (land leases 5 to 66 years), some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 6 years, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. As of December 31, 2023, assets recorded under finance leases amounted to $82 million and accumulated depreciation associated with finance leases was $21 million (December 31, 2022: $82 million and $18 million, respectively). Finance lease liabilities amounted to $19 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: $21 million).\nThe components of operating lease expense were as follows\nFuture minimum lease payments for operating leases as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nRent expense amounted to $11 million in 2023 compared to $11 million in 2022 and $10 million in 2021 (containing services related to leased assets as well as short-term leases).\nLease liabilities related to operating leases are split between current and non-current:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets are $250 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: $250 million) and are included in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet.\nNote 15 - Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company maintains purchase commitments with certain suppliers, primarily for raw materials, semi-finished goods and manufacturing services and for some non-production items. Purchase commitments for inventory materials are generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary for different suppliers. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had purchase commitments of $4,184, which are due through 2044.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are regularly involved as plaintiffs or defendants in claims and litigation relating to a variety of matters such as contractual disputes, personal injury claims, employee grievances and intellectual property litigation. In addition, our acquisitions, divestments and financial transactions sometimes result in, or are followed by, claims or litigation. Some of these claims may possibly be recovered from insurance reimbursements. Although the ultimate disposition of asserted claims cannot be predicted with certainty, it is our belief that the outcome of any such claims, either individually or on a combined basis, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, such outcomes may be material to our consolidated statement of operations for a particular period. The Company records an accrual for any claim that arises whenever it considers that it is probable that it is exposed to a loss contingency and the amount of the loss contingency can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not record a gain contingency until the period in which all contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized or realizable. Legal fees are expensed when incurred.\nImpinj Patent Litigation\nWe are involved in a dispute with Impinj, Inc. (\u201cImpinj\u201d) regarding the infringement of IP rights. Impinj has initiated a number of lawsuits alleging infringement of their IP rights by certain of our products and we have initiated a lawsuit and countersuit alleging infringement of our IP rights by certain products of Impinj. Specifically, on June 6, 2019, Impinj filed a complaint against us in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cCourt\u201d) alleging that certain of our products (NXP\u2019s UCODE8 and UCODE 9 integrated circuits) infringed 26 Impinj patents. The case was subsequently narrowed to two patents: U.S. patent nos. 9,633,302 (the \u201c\u2019302 patent\u201d) and 8,115,597 (the \u201c\u2019597 patent\u201d), seeking damages and injunctive relief. Before trial, the Court granted summary judgment of infringement on the \u2018302 patent. At trial, on July 14, 2023, the jury returned a verdict finding that NXP infringed the asserted claims of the \u2018597 patent. The jury awarded approximately $19 million in damages. The Court subsequently issued its judgment on October 3, 2023, reducing the award to approximately $13 million, ordering a new trial on the \u2018302 patent, and denying Impinj\u2019s request for an injunction based on infringement of the \u2018597 patent. NXP intends to appeal the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 25, 2021, Impinj initiated a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (Waco) alleging that certain of our products infringe 9 Impinj patents. NXP countersued alleging that certain products of Impinj infringe 9 patents owned or licensed by NXP. The Court split the case procedurally into 3 trials, with each party asserting 3 patents at each trial. At the first trial, on November 9, 2023, the jury returned a verdict finding that NXP infringed the asserted claims of U.S. patent nos. 7,733,227, 7,215,251 and 7,472,835 patents. The jury awarded approximately $2 million in damages. We dispute Impinj\u2019s claims and intend to continue to pursue available defenses and appeals. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of the currently accrued amounts given recent developments and future proceedings.\nMotorola Personal Injury Lawsuits\nThe Company is currently assisting Motorola in the defense of personal injury lawsuits due to indemnity obligations included in the agreement that separated Freescale from Motorola in 2004. The multi-plaintiff Motorola lawsuits are pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. These claims allege a link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room facilities and birth defects in 22 individuals. The Motorola suits allege exposures between 1980 and 2005. Each claim seeks an unspecified amount of damages for the alleged injuries; however, legal counsel representing the plaintiffs has indicated they will seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages from Motorola for the entire inventory of claims which, if proven and recovered, the Company considers to be material. A portion of any indemnity due to Motorola will be reimbursed to NXP if Motorola receives an indemnification payment from its insurance coverage. Motorola has potential insurance coverage for many of the years indicated above, but with differing types and levels of coverage, self-insurance retention amounts and deductibles. We are in discussions with Motorola and their insurers regarding the availability of applicable insurance coverage for each of the individual cases. Motorola and NXP have denied liability for these alleged injuries based on numerous defenses.\nLegal Proceedings Related Accruals and Insurance Coverage\nThe Company reevaluates at least on a quarterly basis the claims that have arisen to determine whether any new accruals need to be made or whether any accruals made need to be adjusted based on the most current information available to it and based on its best estimate. Based on the procedures described above, the\nCompany has an aggregate amount of $112 million accrued for potential and current legal proceedings pending as of December 31, 2023, compared to $58 million accrued at December 31, 2022 (without reduction for any related insurance reimbursements). The accruals are included in \u201cOther current liabilities\u201d and \u201cOther non-current liabilities.\u201d As of December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s balance related to insurance reimbursements was $67 million (December 31, 2022: $43 million) and is included in \u201cOther non-current assets.\u201d\nThe Company also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the amount accrued based on currently available information for those cases for which such estimate can be made. The estimated aggregate range requires significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants (including the Company) in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the claims, and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate. As at December 31, 2023, the Company believes that for all litigation pending its potential aggregate exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued (without reduction for any amounts that may possibly be recovered under insurance programs) could range between $0 million and $100 million. Based upon our past experience with these matters, the Company would expect to receive additional insurance reimbursement of up to $70 million on certain of these claims that would partially offset the potential aggregate exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued.\nLoss recovery\nIn February 2021, NXP\u2019s two wafer manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas were negatively impacted by unusually severe winter weather conditions that corresponded with a widespread disruption of gas, electricity, and water. The Company had insurance coverage for the repair or replacement of assets that suffered damage or loss and business interruption coverage, including lost profits, and the reimbursement of other expenses and costs that have been incurred relating to the damages and losses suffered.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $177 million in insurance proceeds directly offsetting the loss from operations that were incurred in the period.\nEnvironmental remediation\nIn each jurisdiction in which we operate, we are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations.\nAs with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property, the Company faces inherent risks of environmental liability at our current and legacy manufacturing facilities. Certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. Some specific laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be a contributor or responsible party for environmental contamination.\nSoil and groundwater contamination has been identified at our properties in Nijmegen, the Netherlands and near Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The remediation processes at these locations are expected to continue for many years.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have recorded $90 million for environmental remediation costs (2022: $87 million, which are primarily included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount represents the undiscounted future cash flows of our estimated share of costs incurred in environmental cleanup sites without considering recovery of costs from any other party or insurer, since in most cases potentially responsible parties other than us may exist and be held responsible.\nNote 16 - Stockholders\u2019 Equity and Earnings per Share\nThe share capital of the Company as of December 31, 2023 consists of 1,076,257,500 authorized shares, including 430,503,000 authorized shares of common stock, and 645,754,500 authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.\nFor repurchases of shares in 2021 and 2022, the board of directors of NXP (\"the Board\") made use of the authorizations renewed by the annual general meeting of shareholders on June 17, 2019, May 27, 2020, May 26, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively. The Board has approved the purchase of shares from participants in NXP's equity programs to satisfy participants' tax withholding obligations and this authorization will remain in effect until terminated by the Board. In November 2019, the Board approved the repurchase of shares up to a maximum of $2 billion (the \"2019 Share Repurchase Program\"). In March 2021, the Board approved the repurchase of shares up to a maximum of $2 billion (the \"2021 Share Repurchase Program\"), and in August 2021, the Board increased the 2021 Share Repurchase Program authorization by $2 billion, for a total of $4 billion approved for the repurchase of shares under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program. In January 2022, the Board approved the repurchase of shares up to a maximum of $2 billion (the \"2022 Share Repurchase Program\").\nDuring the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2023, NXP repurchased 5.5 million shares, for a total of approximately $1 billion, and during the year-ended December 31, 2022, NXP repurchased 8.3 million shares, for a total of approximately $1.4 billion. As approved by the board of directors, on December 15, 2020, NXP canceled some 26 million shares and on November 30, 2021, NXP canceled 15 million shares. As a result, the number of issued NXP shares as per December 31, 2022 is 274,519,638 shares and as per December 31, 2023, the Company has issued and paid up 274,519,638 shares of common stock each having a par value of \u20ac0.20 or a nominal stock capital of \u20ac55 million (2022: \u20ac55 million).\nCash dividends\nThe following dividends were declared in 2023, 2022 and 2021 under NXP\u2019s quarterly dividend program which was introduced as of the third quarter of 2018:\nShare-based awards\nThe Company has granted share-based awards to the members of our board of directors, management team, our other executives, selected other key employees/talents of NXP and selected new hires to receive the Company\u2019s shares in the future. See Note 17, \u201cShare-based Compensation.\u201d\nTreasury shares\nFrom time to time, last on May 24, 2023, the General Meeting of Shareholders authorizes the Board of Directors to repurchase shares of our common stock. On that basis, the Board of Directors has approved various share repurchase programs. In accordance with the Company\u2019s policy to provide share-based awards from its treasury share inventory, shares which have been repurchased and are held in treasury for delivery upon exercise of options and under restricted and performance share programs, are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders\u2019 equity. Treasury shares are recorded at cost, representing the market price on the acquisition date. When issued, shares are removed from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.\nDifferences between the cost and the proceeds received when treasury shares are reissued, are recorded in capital in excess of par value. Deficiencies in excess of net gains arising from previous treasury share issuances are charged to retained earnings.\nThe following transactions took place resulting from employee option and share plans:\nShareholder tax on repurchased shares\nUnder Dutch tax law, the repurchase of a company\u2019s shares by an entity in the Netherlands is a taxable event (unless exemptions apply). The tax on the repurchased shares is attributed to the shareholders, with NXP making the payment on the shareholders\u2019 behalf. As such, the tax on the repurchased shares is accounted for within stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe computation of earnings per share (EPS) is presented in the following table:\n1)No stock options to purchase shares of NXP\u2019s common stock that were outstanding in 2023 (2022: none; 2021: none) were anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common stock or the number of shares assumed to be repurchased using the proceeds of unrecognized compensation expense and exercise prices was greater than the weighted average number of shares underlying outstanding stock options.\n2)No unvested RSU\u2019s, PSU\u2019s and equity rights that were outstanding in 2023 (2022: 0.3 shares; 2021: 0.1 million shares) were anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the number of shares assumed to be repurchased using the proceeds of unrecognized compensation expense was greater than the weighted average number of outstanding unvested RSU\u2019s, PSU\u2019s and equity rights or the performance goal has not been met.\nNote 17 - Share-based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense is included in the following line items in our consolidated statement of operations:\nThe income tax (expense) benefit recognized in net income related to share-based compensation expenses was $36 million (includes $9 million of excess tax benefits), $26 million (includes $4 million of excess tax benefits) and $54 million (includes $32 million of excess tax benefits) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLong Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\nThe LTIP was introduced in 2010 and is a broad-based long-term retention program to attract, retain and motivate talented employees as well as align stockholder and employee interests. The LTIP provides share-based compensation (\u201cawards\u201d) to both our eligible employees and non-employee directors. Awards that may be granted include performance shares, stock options and restricted shares. Awards granted generally will become fully vested upon a termination event occurring within one year following a change in control, as defined. A termination event is defined as either termination of employment or services other than for cause or constructive termination resulting from a significant reduction in either the nature or scope of duties and responsibilities, a reduction in compensation or a required relocation. The number of shares authorized and available for awards at December 31, 2023 was 18.0 million.\nA charge of $398 million was recorded in 2023 for the LTIP (2022: $353 million; 2021: $331 million).\nA summary of the activity for our LTIP\u2019s during 2023 is presented below.\nStock options\nAt December 31, 2023, there were no (2022: none) unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options.\nNo options were granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe intrinsic value of the exercised options was $13 million (2022: $15 million; 2021: $27 million), whereas the amount received by NXP was $5 million (2022: $3 million; 2021: $10 million). The tax benefit realized from stock options exercised during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $36 million, $24 million, and $58 million, respectively.\nPerformance share units\nMarket performance conditions\nThe Company grants PSU awards to certain executives of the Company with a performance measure of Relative Total Shareholder Return (\u201cRelative TSR\u201d). Each PSU, which generally cliff vests on the third anniversary of the date of grant, entitles the grant recipient to receive from 0 to 2 common shares for each of the target units awarded based on the Relative TSR of the Company's share price as compared to a set of peer companies.\nThe fair value of the PSUs is calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model, utilizing assumptions underlying the Black-Scholes methodology:\nIn 2023, the weighted average grant date fair value of performance share units granted was $214.02 (2022: $188.70; 2021: $257.18).\nIn 2023, the fair value of the performance share units at the time of vesting was $83 million (2022: $42 million; 2021: $395 million).\nAt December 31, 2023, there was a total of $109 million (2022: $100 million; 2021: $90 million) of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance share units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years (2022: 1.9 years; 2021: 1.7 years).\nRestricted share units\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of restricted share units granted in 2023 was $178.69 (2022: $147.73; 2021: $201.68). The fair value of the restricted share units at the time of vesting was $372 million (2022: $319 million; 2021: $533 million).\nAt December 31, 2023, there was a total of $685 million (2022: $621 million; 2021: $546 million) of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted share units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years (2022: 1.6 years; 2021: 1.6 years).\nNote 18 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nTotal comprehensive income (loss) represents net income (loss) plus the results of certain equity changes not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The after-tax components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and their corresponding changes are shown below:\nNote 19 - Related-party Transactions\nThe Company\u2019s related parties are the members of the board of directors of NXP Semiconductors N.V., the executive officers of NXP Semiconductors N.V. and equity-accounted investees.\nThe following table presents the amounts related to revenue and other income and purchase of goods and services incurred in transactions with these related parties:\nThe following table presents the amounts related to receivable and payable balances with these related parties:\nNote 20 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our financial instruments, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nInvestments in short-term deposits, representing liquid assets with original maturity beyond three months and having no significant risk of changes in fair value, are represented at carrying value as reasonable estimates of fair value due to the relatively short period of time between the origination of the instruments and their expected realization. Money market funds (as part of our cash and cash equivalents) and marketable equity securities (as part of other non-current assets) have fair value measurements which are all based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. For derivatives (as part of other current assets or accrued liabilities) the fair value is based upon significant other observable inputs depending on the nature of the derivative.\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nWe measure and record our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, at fair value when an impairment charge is required.\nAssets and liabilities not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis\nFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period and debt.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of current and non-current debt was $10.3 billion ($9.8 billion as of December 31, 2022). The fair value is estimated on the basis of broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. Accrued interest is included under accrued liabilities and not within the carrying amount or estimated fair value of debt.\nNote 21 - Other Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Currency Risk\nWe conduct business in diverse markets around the world and employ a variety of risk management strategies and techniques to manage foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. One way we achieve this is through the active hedging of risks through the selective use of derivative instruments.\nDerivatives are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value which fluctuates based on changing market conditions.\nThe Company does not purchase or hold financial derivative instruments for trading purposes.\nCurrency risk\nThe Company\u2019s transactions are denominated in a variety of currencies. The Company uses financial instruments to reduce its exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s organizations identify and measure their exposures from transactions denominated in other than their own functional currency. We calculate our net exposure on a cash flow basis considering balance sheet items, actual orders received or made and anticipated revenue and expenses. The Company generally hedges foreign currency exposures in relation to transaction exposures, such as receivables/payables resulting from such transactions and part of anticipated sales and purchases. The Company generally uses forwards to hedge these exposures. As of January 1, 2016, as a result of the acquisition of Freescale, NXP concluded that the functional currency of the Company is USD. Beginning from January 1, 2016, our U.S. dollar-denominated notes and short term loans no longer needed to be re-measured. Prior to January 1, 2016, the U.S. dollar-denominated debt held by our Dutch subsidiary (which had at that time a euro functional currency) could have generated adverse currency results in financial income and expenses depending on the exchange rate movement between the euro and the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar exposure of the net investment in U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries was hedged by certain of our U.S. dollar denominated debt. The hedging relationship was assumed to be highly effective. Foreign currency gains or losses on this U.S. dollar debt that were recorded in a euro functional currency entity that were designated as, and to the extent they were effective, as a hedge of the net investment in our U.S. dollar foreign entities, were reported as a translation adjustment in other comprehensive income within equity, and offset in whole or in part the foreign currency changes to the net investment that were also reported in other comprehensive income. Absent the application of net investment hedging, these amounts would have been recorded as a loss within financial income (expense) in the statement of operations.\nNote 22 - Segments and Geographical Information\nNXP has one reportable segment representing the entity as a whole, aligning with our organizational structure and with the way our chief operating decision maker makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the business.\nGeographical Information\nRevenue attributed to geographic areas is based on the customer\u2019s shipped-to location. These locations are not necessarily indicative of the geographic location of our end customers or the country in which our end customers sell devices containing our products.\nLong-lived assets include Property and equipment, net, which were based on the physical location of the assets as of the end of each year.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and included controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance, regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the criteria established in \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\u201d by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nIt should be noted that any control system, regardless of how well it is designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Control systems can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. In addition, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nThe Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2023, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",
