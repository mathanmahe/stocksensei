    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nlululemon athletica inc. is principally a designer, distributor, and retailer of healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel and accessories. We have a vision to be the experiential brand that ignites a community of people through sweat, grow, and connect, which we call \"living the sweatlife.\" Since our inception, we have fostered a distinctive corporate culture; we promote a set of core values in our business which include taking personal responsibility, nurturing entrepreneurial spirit, acting with honesty and courage, valuing connection, and choosing to have fun. These core values attract passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals, and share our purpose \"to elevate the world by unleashing the full potential within every one of us.\"\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"10-K\" or \"Report\") for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020 (\"fiscal 2019\"), lululemon athletica inc. (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as \"lululemon,\" \"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our.\"\nOur Products\nOur healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel and accessories are marketed under the lululemon brand. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories for women and men. Our apparel assortment includes items such as pants, shorts, tops, and jackets designed for a healthy lifestyle including athletic activities such as yoga, running, training, and most other sweaty pursuits. We also offer fitness-related accessories.\nOur design and development team continues to source technically advanced fabrics, with new feel and fit, and craft innovative functional features for our products. Through our vertical retail strategy and direct connection with our guests, we are able to collect feedback and incorporate unique performance and fashion needs into our design process. In this way, we believe we solve problems for our guests, helping us advance our product lines and differentiate us from the competition.\nAlthough we benefit from the growing number of people that participate in yoga, we believe the percentage of our products sold for other activities will continue to increase as we broaden our product range.\nOur Market\nOur guests seek a combination of performance, style, and sensation in their athletic apparel, choosing products that allow them to feel great however they exercise. Since consumer purchase decisions are driven by both an actual need for functional products and a desire to live a particular lifestyle, we believe the credibility of our brand and the authentic community experiences we offer expand our potential market beyond just athletes to those who pursue an active, mindful, and balanced life.\nAlthough our primary and largest customer group is made up of women, we also design a comprehensive men's line and have a targeted strategy in place to serve our male guests. Our business is growing as more men discover the technical rigor and premium quality of our products, and are attracted by our distinctive brand.\nNorth America is our largest market by geographical split, offering a mature health and wellness industry and sophisticated consumer. Additionally, we are expanding internationally across Europe, the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\"), and the rest of Asia Pacific. We are expanding in these regions via a decentralized model, allowing for local community insight and consumer preference to inform our strategic expansion.\nOur Segments\nWe primarily conduct our business through two channels: company-operated stores and direct to consumer.\nWe also generate net revenue from outlets, sales from temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, through license and supply arrangements, and warehouse sales. The net revenue we generate from these sources is combined in our other segment.\nWe operate in both the physical and digital space to better cater to the shopping desires of our guest. At the end of fiscal 2019, we had 491 stores in 17 countries across the globe. In addition to being a venue to sell product, our stores give us a direct connection to our guest, which we view as a valuable tool in helping us build our brand and product line.\nOur direct to consumer segment includes the net revenue which we generate from our e-commerce website www.lululemon.com, other country and region specific websites, and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers or other retail locations.\nCompany-Operated Stores\nAs of February 2, 2020, our retail footprint included 491 company-operated stores. While most of our company-operated stores are branded lululemon, five of our company-operated stores are branded ivivva and specialize in athletic wear for female youth. Our retail stores are located primarily on street locations, in lifestyle centers, and in malls.\nOur company-operated stores by country as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019 are summarized in the table below:\n__________\n(1)\nPRC included six company-operated stores in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, two company-operated stores in Macao, Special Administration Region, and one company-operated store in Taiwan, PRC as of February 2, 2020. As of February 3, 2019, there were five company-operated stores in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, one company-operated store in Macao, Special Administration Region, and one company-operated store in Taiwan, PRC.\nWe opened 51 net new company-operated stores in fiscal 2019, including 32 net new stores outside of North America.\nWe perform ongoing evaluations of our portfolio of company-operated store locations. During fiscal 2019, we closed four of our lululemon branded company-operated stores and two of our ivivva branded company-operated stores. As we continue our evaluations we may, in future periods, close or relocate additional company-operated stores.\nIn fiscal 2020, our new store growth will come primarily from company-operated store openings in Asia and in the United States. Our real estate strategy over the next several years will not only consist of opening new company-operated stores, but also in overall square footage growth through store expansions and relocations.\nWe believe that our innovative retail concept and guest experience contribute to the success of our stores. We use sales per square foot to assess the performance of our company-operated stores relative to their square footage. We believe that sales per square foot is useful in evaluating the performance of our company-operated stores. During fiscal 2019, our sales per square foot was $1,657.\nSales per square foot is calculated using total net revenue from company-operated stores that opened, or opened in their significantly expanded space, prior to the current fiscal year. The total net revenue of these stores for the fiscal year is divided by the total square footage of these stores at the end of the year. The fiscal 2019 sales per square foot metric is based on an average square footage of 3,127 per store as of February 2, 2020. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of sales per square foot. The square footage of our company-operated stores includes all retail related space, storage areas, and administrative space used by the store employees. It excludes any space used for non-retail related activities. The sales per square foot metric we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies.\nDirect to Consumer\nDirect to consumer is a substantial part of our business, representing 28.6% of our net revenue in fiscal 2019. We believe that e-commerce is convenient for our core customer and enhances the image of our brand. Our direct to consumer channel\nmakes our product accessible to more markets than our company-operated store channel alone. We believe this channel is effective in building brand awareness, especially in new markets.\nWe continue to evolve and integrate our digital and physical channels in order to enrich our interactions with our guests, and to provide an enhanced omni-channel experience.\nOther Channels\nOther net revenue accounted for 8.6% of total net revenue in fiscal 2019, compared to 9.2% in fiscal 2018, and 8.9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2017. Other net revenue includes sales made through the following channels:\n\u2022\nOutlets and warehouse sales - We utilize outlets as well as physical warehouse sales, which are held from time to time, to sell slow moving inventory and inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices.\n\u2022\nTemporary locations - Our temporary locations, including seasonal stores, are typically opened for a short period of time in markets in which we may not already have a presence.\n\u2022\nWholesale - Our wholesale accounts include premium yoga studios, health clubs, and fitness centers. We believe these premium wholesale locations offer an alternative distribution channel that is convenient for our core consumer and enhances the image of our brand. We do not intend wholesale to be a significant contributor to overall sales. Instead, we use the channel to build brand awareness, including outside of North America.\n\u2022\nLicense and supply arrangements - We enter into license and supply arrangements from time to time when we believe that it will be to our advantage to partner with companies and individuals with significant experience and proven success in certain target markets.\nWe have entered into license and supply arrangements with partners in the Middle East and Mexico which grant them the right to operate lululemon branded retail locations in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and Mexico. We retain the rights to sell lululemon products through our e-commerce websites in these countries. Under these arrangements we supply the partners with lululemon products, training and other support. The initial term of the agreement for the Middle East expired in January 2020 and we currently intend to stay in the market. The initial term of the agreement for Mexico expires in November 2026. As of February 2, 2020, there were four licensed retail locations in Mexico, three in the United Arab Emirates, and one in Qatar, which are not included in the above company-operated stores table.\nCommunity-Based Marketing\nWe utilize a community-based approach to build brand awareness and customer loyalty. We pursue a multi-faceted strategy which leverages our local teams and ambassadors, digital marketing and social media, in-store community boards, and a variety of grassroots initiatives. We also plan to continue to explore how we can complement and amplify our community-based initiatives with global brand-building activity.\nProduct Design and Development\nOur product design and development efforts are led by a team of researchers, scientists, engineers, and designers. Our team is comprised of athletes and users of our products who embody our design philosophy and dedication to premium quality. Our design and development team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the input of our guests and our ambassadors, and broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of function, style, and technical superiority.\nAs we strive to continue to provide our guests with technically advanced fabrics, our team works closely with our suppliers to incorporate the latest in technical innovation, bringing particular specifications to our products. We partner with independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety of tests on our fabrics, testing performance characteristics including pilling, shrinkage, abrasion resistance, and colorfastness. We develop proprietary fabrics and collaborate with leading fabric and trims suppliers to manufacture fabrics and trims that we ultimately protect through agreements, trademarks, and trade-secrets.\nSourcing and Manufacturing\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide fabrics for, and to produce, our products. The following statistics are based on cost.\nWe work with a group of approximately 39 vendors that manufacture our products, five of which produced approximately 56% of our products in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2019, the largest single manufacturer produced approximately 17% of our\nproducts. During fiscal 2019, approximately 33% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 16% in Cambodia, 15% in Sri Lanka, and 11% in the PRC, including 2% in Taiwan, PRC.\nWe work with a group of approximately 76 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. In fiscal 2019, approximately 59% of our fabrics were produced by our top five fabric suppliers, and the largest single manufacturer produced approximately 32% of fabric used. During fiscal 2019, approximately 46% of our fabrics originated from Taiwan, PRC, 14% from the rest of the PRC, 19% from Sri Lanka, and the remainder from other regions.\nWe also source other raw materials which are used in our products, including items such as content labels, elastics, buttons, clasps, and drawcords from suppliers located predominantly in the Asia Pacific region.\nWe have developed long-standing relationships with a number of our vendors and take great care to ensure that they share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not, however, have any long-term term contracts with the majority of our suppliers or manufacturing sources for the production and supply of our fabrics and garments, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, and production. We require that all of our manufacturers adhere to our vendor code of ethics regarding social and environmental sustainability practices. Our product quality and sustainability teams partner with leading inspection and verification firms to closely monitor each supplier's compliance with applicable laws and our vendor code of ethics.\nDistribution Facilities\nWe operate and distribute finished products from our distribution facilities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. We own our distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, and lease our other distribution facilities. We also utilize third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from their warehouse locations in the PRC and the Netherlands. We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and consolidate or expand our distribution capacity as we believe appropriate for our operations and to meet anticipated needs.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the athletic apparel industry is based principally on brand image and recognition as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution, and price. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of our premium brand image and our technical product innovation. We also believe our ability to introduce new product innovations, combine function and fashion, and connect through in-store and community experiences sets us apart from our competition. In addition, we believe our vertical retail distribution strategy and community-based marketing differentiates us further, allowing us to more effectively control our brand image and connect with our guest.\nThe market for athletic apparel is highly competitive. It includes increasing competition from established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of performance products, as well as from frequent new entrants to the market. We are in direct competition with wholesalers and direct sellers of athletic apparel, such as Nike, Inc., adidas AG, and Under Armour, Inc. We also compete with retailers who have expanded to include women's athletic apparel including The Gap, Inc. (including the Athleta brand) and Victoria's Secret with its Sport collection.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. Our annual net revenue is weighted more heavily toward our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season, while our operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year. As a result, a substantial portion of our operating profits are generated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. For example, we generated approximately 47% of our full year operating profit during each of the fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.\nOur Employees\nWe believe that our people are key to the success of our business, and we strive to foster a distinctive corporate culture rooted in our core business values which attract passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals.\nAs of February 2, 2020, we had approximately 19,000 employees, of which approximately 11,000 were employed in the United States, approximately 5,200 were employed in Canada, and approximately 2,800 were employed outside of North America. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages by our employees and we believe our relations with our employees are excellent.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have trademark rights on most of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in building our brand image and in distinguishing our products from the products of others. We consider our lululemon and wave design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. In addition, we own many other trademarks for names of several of our brands, slogans, fabrics and products. We own registered and pending U.S. and foreign utility and design patents, industrial designs in Canada, and registered community designs in Europe that protect our product innovations, distinctive apparel, and accessory designs.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Filings\nOur website address is www.lululemon.com. We provide free access to various reports that we file with, or furnish to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed or furnished. These reports include, but are not limited to, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports. Our SEC reports can also be accessed through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Also available on our website are printable versions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and charters of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Governance Committees of our board of directors. Information on our website does not constitute part of this annual report on Form 10-K or any other report we file or furnish with the SEC.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also impair our business and operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand.\nOur success depends on the value and reputation of the lululemon brand. The lululemon name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality product, and guest experience. We rely on social media, as one of our marketing strategies, to have a positive impact on both our brand value and reputation. Our brand and reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, if our public image was to be tarnished by negative publicity, which could be amplified by social media, if we fail to deliver innovative and high quality products acceptable to our guests, or if we face or mishandle a product recall. Additionally, while we devote considerable efforts and resources to protecting our intellectual property, if these efforts are not successful the value of our brand may be harmed. Any harm to our brand and reputation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf any of our products are unacceptable to us or our guests, our business could be harmed.\nWe have occasionally received, and may in the future receive, shipments of products that fail to comply with our technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards. We have also received, and may in the future receive, products that are otherwise unacceptable to us or our guests. Under these circumstances, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenue resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. Additionally, if the unacceptability of our products is not discovered until after such products are purchased by our guests, our guests could lose confidence in our products or we could face a product recall and our results of operations could suffer and our business, reputation, and brand could be harmed.\nThe recent COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak and related government, private sector, and individual consumer responsive actions may adversely affect our business operations, store traffic, employee availability, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization continues to spread in the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. Related government and private sector responsive actions may adversely affect our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the situation is rapidly evolving.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as malls and lifestyle centers. In February 2020, we temporarily\nclosed all of our retail locations in Mainland China. All but one of these locations have since reopened. In March 2020, we temporarily closed all of our retail locations in North America, Europe, Malaysia, New Zealand, and we temporarily closed our distribution center in Sumner, WA. These locations currently remain closed. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of our store closures and other business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S., Canadian, and global economies, consumer willingness to visit stores, malls, and lifestyle centers, and employee willingness to staff our stores once they re-open. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenue and profitability.\nThe market for technical athletic apparel is highly competitive. Competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins or lost market share, or a failure to grow or maintain our market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. We compete directly against wholesalers and direct retailers of athletic apparel, including large, diversified apparel companies with substantial market share and established companies expanding their production and marketing of technical athletic apparel, as well as against retailers specifically focused on women's athletic apparel. We also face competition from wholesalers and direct retailers of traditional commodity athletic apparel, such as cotton T-shirts and sweatshirts. Many of our competitors are large apparel and sporting goods companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. Because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other apparel sellers, including those specializing in yoga apparel and other activewear. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, store development, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we do.\nOur competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can. In contrast to our grassroots community-based marketing approach, many of our competitors promote their brands through traditional forms of advertising, such as print media and television commercials, and through celebrity endorsements, and have substantial resources to devote to such efforts. Our competitors may also create and maintain brand awareness using traditional forms of advertising more quickly than we can. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales in their new and existing markets faster than we do by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do, such as catalog sales or an extensive franchise network.\nIn addition, because we hold limited patents and exclusive intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics or processes underlying our products, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, fabrication techniques, and styling similar to our products.\nOur reliance on suppliers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products could cause problems in our supply chain.\nWe do not manufacture our products or the raw materials for them and rely instead on suppliers. Many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed and manufactured by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from only one or a very limited number of sources. We have no long-term contracts with any of our suppliers or manufacturers for the production and supply of our raw materials and products, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, other raw materials, and production. The following statistics are based on cost.\nWe work with a group of approximately 39 vendors that manufacture our products, five of which produced approximately 56% of our products in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2019, the largest single manufacturer produced approximately 17% of our products. During fiscal 2019, approximately 33% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 16% in Cambodia, 15% in Sri Lanka, and 11% in the PRC, including 2% in Taiwan, PRC.\nWe work with a group of approximately 76 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. In fiscal 2019, approximately 59% of our fabrics were produced by our top five fabric suppliers, and the largest single manufacturer produced approximately 32% of fabric used. During fiscal 2019, approximately 46% of our fabrics originated from Taiwan, PRC, 14% from the rest of the PRC, 19% from Sri Lanka, and the remainder from other regions.\nWe also source other raw materials which are used in our products, including items such as content labels, elastics, buttons, clasps, and drawcords from suppliers located predominantly in the Asia Pacific region.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources and we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, if we experience significant increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier or\nmanufacturer, we may be unable to locate additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate any supplier or manufacturer with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with its quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, and quality control standards. Our supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could be disrupted or delayed by the impact of global health pandemics, including the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and the related government and private sector responsive actions such as border closures, restrictions on product shipments, and travel restrictions. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from our markets or from other participants in our supply chain. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet guest demand for our products and result in lower net revenue and income from operations both in the short and long term.\nThe operations of many of our suppliers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlmost all of our suppliers are located outside of North America, and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022\nthe impact of health conditions, including the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and related government and private sector responsive actions, and other changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers, or guests are located;\n\u2022\npolitical unrest, terrorism, labor disputes, and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights, including trademark protection, in some countries, particularly in the PRC; and\n\u2022\ndisruptions or delays in shipments whether due to port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors, natural disasters or health pandemics, or other transportation disruptions.\nThese and other factors beyond our control could interrupt our suppliers' production in offshore facilities, influence the ability of our suppliers to export our products cost-effectively or at all and inhibit our suppliers' ability to procure certain materials, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business could be harmed if our suppliers and manufacturers do not comply with our Vendor Code of Ethics or applicable laws.\nWhile we require our suppliers and manufacturers to comply with our Vendor Code of Ethics, which includes labor, health and safety, and environment standards, we do not control their practices. If suppliers or contractors do not comply with these standards or applicable laws or there is negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers or manufacturers, even if unfounded or not material to our supply chain, our reputation and sales could be adversely affected, we could be subject to legal liability, or we could be forced to locate alternative suppliers or manufacturing sources.\nAn economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products.\nMany of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending on discretionary items include general economic conditions (particularly those in North America), high levels of unemployment, health pandemics (such as the impact of the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, including reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures), higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, tax rates and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. Unfavorable economic conditions may\nlead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products. Consumer demand for our products may not reach our targets, or may decline, when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets, particularly in North America. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur sales and profitability may decline as a result of increasing product costs and decreasing selling prices.\nOur business is subject to significant pressure on costs and pricing caused by many factors, including intense competition, constrained sourcing capacity and related inflationary pressure, pressure from consumers to reduce the prices we charge for our products, and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to experience increased costs, reduce our prices to consumers or experience reduced sales in response to increased prices, any of which could cause our operating margin to decline if we are unable to offset these factors with reductions in operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative, and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales and profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to introduce new products or novel technologies in a timely manner or our new products or technologies are not accepted by our guests, our competitors may introduce similar products in a more timely fashion, which could hurt our goal to be viewed as a leader in technical athletic apparel innovation. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of athletic apparel or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Our failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. Our failure to effectively introduce new products that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenue and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast guest demand for our products.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in guest demand for our products or for products of our competitors, our failure to accurately forecast guest acceptance of new products, product introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions (for example, because of unexpected effects on inventory supply and consumer demand caused by the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic), and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. If we fail to accurately forecast guest demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale in our stores or for delivery to guests.\nInventory levels in excess of guest demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would cause our gross margin to suffer and could impair the strength and exclusivity of our brand. Conversely, if we underestimate guest demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our reputation and guest relationships.\nOur inability to safeguard against security breaches or our failure to comply with data privacy laws could damage our customer relationships and result in significant legal and financial exposure.\nAs part of our normal operations, we receive confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of theft or misuse of this information, and could result in litigation and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to be able to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, despite taking measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, our customers and our business could still be exposed to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may\nresult in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber-attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers' shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues including intentional or inadvertent breach by employees or persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws and regulations such as the European Union's General Data Privacy Regulation (\"GDPR\") and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"). These regulations require companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection, and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to four percent of worldwide revenue. The GDPR, CCPA, and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines, negative publicity, or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nAny material disruption of our information technology systems or unexpected network interruption could disrupt our business and reduce our sales.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and third-parties to operate our e-commerce websites, process transactions, respond to guest inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis, and maintain cost-efficient operations. The failure of our information technology systems to operate properly or effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or difficulty in integrating new systems, could adversely affect our business. In addition, we have e-commerce websites in the United States, Canada, and internationally. Our information technology systems, websites, and operations of third parties on whom we rely, may encounter damage or disruption or slowdown caused by a failure to successfully upgrade systems, system failures, viruses, computer \"hackers\", natural disasters, or other causes. These could cause information, including data related to guest orders, to be lost or delayed which could, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during the holiday season, result in delays in the delivery of products to our stores and guests or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our products and cause our sales to decline. The concentration of our primary offices, two of our distribution centers, and a number of our stores along the west coast of North America could amplify the impact of a natural disaster occurring in that area to our business, including to our information technology systems. In addition, if changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose guests. We have limited back-up systems and redundancies, and our information technology systems and websites have experienced system failures and electrical outages in the past which have disrupted our operations. Any significant disruption in our information technology systems or websites could harm our reputation and credibility, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our customers shop with us through our e-commerce websites and mobile apps. Increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile apps to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in consumer shopping preferences and shifts in distribution channels could materially impact our results of operations.\nWe sell our products through a variety of trade channels, with a significant portion through traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. As strong e-commerce channels emerge and develop, we are evolving towards an omni-channel approach to support the shopping behavior of our guests. This involves country and region specific websites, social media, product notification emails, mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, and online order fulfillment through stores. The diversion of sales from our company-operated stores could adversely impact our return on investment and could lead to store closures and impairment charges. We could have difficulty in\nrecreating the in-store experience through direct channels. We could also be exposed to liability for online content. Our failure to successfully integrate our digital and physical channels and respond to these risks might adversely impact our business and results of operations, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nThe fluctuating cost of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nThe fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers include synthetic fabrics whose raw materials include petroleum-based products. Our products also include silver and natural fibers, including cotton. Our costs for raw materials are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries, and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. Increases in the cost of raw materials, including petroleum or the prices we pay for silver and our cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles, could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new international markets may limit our expansion and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nOur future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of North America. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in any new market. In connection with our expansion efforts we may encounter obstacles we did not face in North America, including cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments, and foreign guests' tastes and preferences. We may also encounter difficulty expanding into new international markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our technical athletic apparel by guests in these new international markets. Our failure to develop our business in new international markets or disappointing growth outside of existing markets could harm our business and results of operations.\nGlobal economic and political conditions and global events such as health pandemics could adversely impact our results of operations.\nUncertain or challenging global economic and political conditions could impact our performance, including our ability to successfully expand internationally. Global economic conditions could impact levels of consumer spending in the markets in which we operate, which could impact our sales and profitability. Political unrest could negatively impact our guests and employees, reduce consumer spending, and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Health pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and the related governmental, private sector and individual consumer responsive actions could reduce store traffic and consumer spending, result in temporary or permanent closures of stores, offices, and factories, and could negatively impact the flow of goods.\nIf we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market and to meet guest expectations could be harmed.\nWe rely on our distribution facilities for substantially all of our product distribution. Our distribution facilities include computer controlled and automated equipment, which means their operations may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions, or other system failures. In addition, our operations could also be interrupted by labor difficulties, extreme or severe weather conditions or by floods, fires, or other natural disasters near our distribution centers. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet guest expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be harmed.\nOur fabrics and manufacturing technology generally are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors.\nThe intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics, and processes used to manufacture our products generally are owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. Our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is therefore limited and we do not generally own patents or hold exclusive intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics or processes underlying our products. As a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, fabrics and styling similar to our products. Because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. If our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenue and profitability could suffer.\nOur failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.\nWe currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade dress, and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of these rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. In addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States or Canada, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our intellectual property rights by other parties in these countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished, and our competitive position may suffer.\nOur ability to source and sell our merchandise profitably or at all could be hurt if new trade restrictions are imposed or existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.\nThe United States and the countries in which our products are produced or sold internationally have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty, or tariff levels. The results of any audits or related disputes regarding these restrictions or regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions. Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us, could increase shipping times, or may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on international trade agreements and regulations. The countries in which we produce and sell our products could impose or increase tariffs, duties, or other similar charges that could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAdverse changes in, or withdrawal from, trade agreements or political relationships between the United States and the PRC, Canada, or other countries where we sell or source our products, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows. The current political administrations in the United States and the PRC have proposed tariffs which increase the costs of our products. It is possible that further tariffs may be introduced, or increased. Such changes could adversely impact our business and could increase the costs of sourcing our products from the PRC, or could require us to source our products from other countries.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\"UK\") withdrew from the European Union (\"EU\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". There is significant uncertainty related to how the UK's trade, duties, and customs arrangements with the EU will be impacted by Brexit after the transition period, as well as the impact on the movement of goods, people, and capital between the UK and the EU. There could be changes in economic conditions in the UK or EU, including foreign exchange rates and consumer markets. Our business could be adversely affected by these changes, including by additional duties on the importation of our products into the UK from the EU and as a result of shipping delays or congestion.\nChanges in tax laws or unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, Canada, and several other foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rates could be unfavorably impacted by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings amongst countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, new tax interpretations and guidance, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of unremitted earnings for which we have not previously accrued applicable U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.\nRepatriations from our Canadian subsidiaries are not subject to Canadian withholding taxes if such distributions are made as a return of capital. We have not accrued for any Canadian withholding taxes that could be payable on future repatriations from our Canadian subsidiaries because we believe the current net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries can either be repatriated free of withholding tax or is expected to be indefinitely reinvested. The extent to which future increases in the net assets of our Canadian subsidiaries can be repatriated free of withholding tax is dependent on, among other things, the amount of paid-up-capital in our Canadian subsidiaries and transactions undertaken by our exchangeable shareholders. We are unable to determine the timing and extent to which such transactions may occur. Accordingly, increases in our Canadian net assets may result in an increase to our effective tax rate.\nWe and our subsidiaries engage in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect the accurate economic allocation of profit and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, the profit allocation and transfer pricing terms and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities during an audit and any resulting changes may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates.\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States and Canada, subject to significant change. Changes in applicable U.S., Canadian, or other foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our income tax expense and profitability, as they did in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 upon passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nIf we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of our business and as a result our brand image and financial performance may suffer.\nWe have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception in 1998 and our net revenue has increased from $40.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2019. If our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. We could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space for our expanding workforce. This expansion could increase the strain on our resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training, and managing an increasing number of employees. These difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail and distribution space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases.\nWe lease the majority of our stores under operating leases and our inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact our ability to grow. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can be extended in five-year increments if at all. We generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. If an existing or new store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, as we have done in the past and may do in the future, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Similarly, we may be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable leases even if current locations of our stores become unattractive as demographic patterns change. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could require us to close stores in desirable locations.\nWe also lease the majority of our distribution centers and our inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact our ability to deliver our products to the market.\nIncreasing labor costs and other factors associated with the production of our products in South and South East Asia could increase the costs to produce our products.\nA significant portion of our products are produced in South and South East Asia and increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in the countries in this area could significantly increase our costs to produce our products and could have a negative impact on our operations and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the currencies used in these countries, which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products, labor shortage and increases in labor costs, and difficulties and additional costs in transporting products manufactured from these countries to our distribution centers. Also, the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations against products imported by us from, or the loss of \"normal trade relations\" status with any country in which our products are manufactured, could significantly increase our cost of products and harm our business.\nWe may not be able to successfully open new store locations in a timely manner, if at all, which could harm our results of operations.\nOur growth will largely depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores, which depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify suitable store locations, the availability of which is outside of our control;\n\u2022\ngain brand recognition and acceptance, particularly in markets that are new to us;\n\u2022\nnegotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain store personnel and field management;\n\u2022\nimmerse new store personnel and field management into our corporate culture;\n\u2022\nsource sufficient inventory levels; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate new stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.\nOur failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity.\nThe labeling, distribution, importation, marketing, and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission and state attorneys general in the United States, the Competition Bureau and Health Canada in Canada, as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local, and international regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are distributed or sold. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could become subject to enforcement actions or the imposition of significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. In addition, any audits and inspections by governmental agencies related to these matters could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, fines, or other penalties, divert financial and management resources, and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and could impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenue.\nOur international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented procedures designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, some of our employees, agents, or other channel partners, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, could take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the service of our senior management and other key employees.\nIn the last few years, we have had changes to our senior management team including new hires, departures, and role and responsibility changes. The performance of our senior management team and other key employees may not meet our needs and expectations. Also, the loss of services of any of these key employees, or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and could have a negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. Such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance, financial condition, and the market price of our stock.\nWe do not maintain a key person life insurance policy on any of the members of our senior management team. As a result, we would have no way to cover the financial loss if we were to lose the services of members of our senior management team.\nOur business is affected by seasonality.\nOur business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. This seasonality may adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate, and, as a result, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.\nBecause a significant portion of our net revenue and expenses are generated in countries other than the United States, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.\nWe also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.\nWe have, and may continue to, enter into forward currency contracts, or other derivative instruments, in an effort to mitigate the foreign exchange risks which we are exposed to. This may include entering into forward currency contracts to hedge against the foreign exchange gains and losses which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars, or entering into forward currency contracts in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses that arise on monetary assets and liabilities held by our subsidiaries in a currency other than their functional currency.\nAlthough we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements.\nWe are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the forward currency contracts.\nOur trademarks and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products.\nOur success depends in large part on our brand image. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. We have applied for and obtained some United States, Canada, and foreign trademark registrations, and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. However, some or all of these pending trademark applications may not be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. Additionally, we may face obstacles as we expand our product line and the geographic scope of our sales and marketing. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. Our defense of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management resources. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights from third parties, or cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events could harm our business and cause our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition to suffer.\nWe are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to product liability claims, stockholder class action and derivative claims, commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory, employment, and other claims related to our business. Any of these proceedings could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, fines, or other penalties, divert financial and management resources, and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could exceed the limits of our insurance policies or the carriers may decline to fund such final settlements and/or judgments and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our guests and our brand image.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders or others.\nWe may be subject to actions or proposals from stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. Responding to such actions can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, and divert the attention of our board of directors, management, and employees from the pursuit of our business strategies. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan. Activist stockholders or others may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and potential guests, and may affect our relationships with current guests, vendors, investors, and other third parties. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our board of directors. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay and discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider to be favorable.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult or impossible for a third-party to acquire control of us or effect a change in our board of directors and management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of our board of directors into three classes, with one class elected each year;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability to remove a director only for cause and only with the vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock;\n\u2022\na special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our chairman or Chief Executive Officer, or upon a resolution adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors, and not by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nour stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to place stockholder proposals on the agenda for consideration at any meeting of our stockholders.\nIn addition, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to some specified exceptions, prohibits \"business combinations\" between a Delaware corporation and an \"interested stockholder,\" which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation's voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 27, 2019.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions included in the \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in the \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations website (http://investor.lululemon.com/), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.\nOverview\nOur business momentum continued in fiscal 2019. Net revenue grew 21% and total comparable sales increased 17%. In addition, we expanded our operating margin 80 basis points to 22.3% and grew earnings per share 37%, or 28% excluding certain discrete tax items which were recognized in fiscal 2018.\nFueling our performance this year was strength across our product assortment, 18% square footage growth driven by new stores and our remodel program, and a robust e-commerce business. In addition, our local community events and educators continued to connect us with our guests in a truly unique manner.\nThe Power of Three\nWe believe the first year of our Power of Three growth plan proved to be particularly successful. The strategic pillars of this plan are product innovation, omni-guest experience, and market expansion.\nProduct Innovation\nThroughout fiscal 2019, response to our product offerings was strong as we continued to grow our core product categories, expand our merchandise range, and deliver new innovation through our Science of Feel development platform. Momentum continued in both our men's and women's pant category, and we continued to expand the important categories of bras and outerwear. In men's, one of our key growth areas, revenue increased 34% in 2019. We also moved beyond test phase with our new assortment of selfcare personal-care products. We rolled out our initial assortment to 50 stores and online.\nOmni-Guest Experience\nPerformance was strong across both our company-operated store and direct to consumer channels in fiscal 2019, with comparable store sales increasing 9% and direct to consumer net revenue growing 35%, each based on a shifted calendar. In fiscal 2019 we began to engage with our guests in new ways. We began testing a new membership program, with four markets tested in fiscal 2019. We also opened and began testing our first two fully experiential stores in 2019, one in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago and the second at the Mall of America near Minneapolis. These stores were designed to offer dedicated studio space for sweat classes and meditation, locker rooms, healthy foods, and an elevated shopping experience.\nIn fiscal 2019 we continued to host unique events in North America and in our international markets. In addition to our SeaWheeze half marathon and festival in Vancouver, we hosted 10K races in Toronto, Edmonton, and San Diego, our first in the United States. In Europe, we held Sweatlife festivals in London, Paris, and Berlin, and in Mainland China, we hosted our 4th annual Unroll China event. These festivals and events brought together guests, educators, ambassadors, and other members of the local community to engage in sweat classes, yoga, personal development, and meditation.\nMarket Expansion\nIn fiscal 2019, we continued to expand our presence both in North America and in our international markets. During the year, we opened 51 net new company-operated stores, including 19 in North America, 24 in Asia Pacific, and eight in Europe. We expanded into two new markets in Europe during the year, the Netherlands and Norway. We also launched local market e-commerce sites in Germany and France. In Asia, we opened our first stores in Malaysia and launched a local e-commerce site in Japan.\nWe also expanded our seasonal store strategy in fiscal 2019 with approximately 80 seasonal stores in operation for some period of time during the year. These stores allowed us to better cater to our guests in select markets, particularly during the holidays, while also helping introduce new guests to our brand.\nFor fiscal 2019, our business in North America grew 20%, while total growth in our international markets was 32%.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and continues to spread in the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. The spread of COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as malls and lifestyle centers. Government authorities in certain markets in which we operate have also issued orders that require the closure of non-essential businesses and people to remain at home.\nWe have taken actions to close certain retail locations and to reduce operating hours, and we continue to monitor the situation and work closely with local authorities to prioritize the safety of our people and guests. In February 2020, we temporarily closed all of our retail locations in Mainland China. All but one of these locations have since reopened. In March 2020, we temporarily closed all of our retail locations in North America, Europe, Malaysia, New Zealand, and we temporarily closed our distribution center in Sumner, WA. These locations currently remain closed.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic will have on the demand for our products and our supply chain. We expect our sales growth trends to experience a meaningful deterioration from those achieved in fiscal 2019 and to experience a material adverse impact on our fiscal 2020 results. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact.\nWe remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities and our Power of Three growth plan and believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents, and available capacity under our revolving credit facilities, to meet our liquidity needs. As of February 2, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and the capacity under our committed revolving credit facility was $398.2 million.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe summary below provides both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2018 exclude the amounts recognized in connection with U.S. tax reform and taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020, compared to the fiscal year ended February 3, 2019:\n\u2022\nNet revenue increased 21% to $4.0 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net revenue increased 22%.\n\u2022\nTotal comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 17%. On a constant dollar basis, total comparable sales increased 18%.\n-\nComparable store sales increased 9%, or increased 10% on a constant dollar basis.\n-\nDirect to consumer net revenue increased 35%, or increased 35% on a constant dollar basis.\n\u2022\nGross profit increased 22% to $2.2 billion.\n\u2022\nGross margin increased 70 basis points to 55.9%.\n\u2022\nIncome from operations increased 26% to $889.1 million.\n\u2022\nOperating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.3%.\n\u2022\nIncome tax expense increased 9% to $251.8 million. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 28.1% compared to 32.4% for fiscal 2018. The adjusted effective tax rate was 28.0% for fiscal 2018.\n\u2022\nDiluted earnings per share were $4.93 for fiscal 2019 compared to $3.61 in fiscal 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.84 for fiscal 2018.\nDue to the 53rd week in fiscal 2018, comparable sales are calculated on a one week shifted basis such that the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2020 are compared to the 52 weeks ended February 3, 2019 rather than January 27, 2019.\nRefer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for reconciliations between constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and adjusted income tax expense, effective tax rates, and diluted earnings per share, and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nGeneral\nNet revenue is comprised of company-operated store sales, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, other country and region specific websites, and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, and other net revenue, which includes outlet sales, sales from temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, license and supply arrangement net revenue which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to licensees, and warehouse sales.\nCost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise, including freight, duty, and nonrefundable taxes incurred in delivering the goods to our distribution centers. It also includes occupancy costs and depreciation expense for our company-operated store locations, all costs incurred in operating our distribution centers and production, design, distribution, and merchandise departments, hemming, shrink, and inventory provision expense. The primary drivers of the costs of individual products are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold.\nIncome tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products and the proportion of taxable income earned in those jurisdictions. To the extent the relative proportion of taxable income in the jurisdictions fluctuates, or the tax legislation in the respective jurisdictions changes, so will our effective tax rate. We also anticipate that, in the future, we may start to sell our products through retail locations in countries in which we have not yet operated, in which case, we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly. In addition, increases in our Canadian net assets may result in an increase to our effective tax rate due to Canadian withholding taxes that could be payable on future repatriations from our Canadian subsidiaries to the extent that they are not able to be made as a return of capital.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue:\nComparison of Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2018\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue increased $691.0 million, or 21%, to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2019 from $3.3 billion in fiscal 2018. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2019 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2018, net revenue increased $718.5 million, or 22%.\nThe increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased direct to consumer net revenue, net revenue generated by new company-operated stores, and an increase in comparable store sales.\nBased on a shifted calendar, total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 17% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Total comparable sales increased 18% on a constant dollar basis.\nNet revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 is summarized below. The percentages are presented as a percentage of total net revenue.\nCompany-Operated Stores. Net revenue from our company-operated stores segment increased $374.7 million, or 18%, to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2019 from $2.1 billion in fiscal 2018. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment:\n\u2022\nNet revenue from company-operated stores we opened or significantly expanded subsequent to February 3, 2019, and are therefore not included in comparable store sales, increased net revenue by $238.5 million. During fiscal 2019 we opened 51 net new company-operated stores, including 24 stores in Asia Pacific, 19 stores in North America, and eight stores in Europe.\n\u2022\nBased on a shifted calendar, a comparable store sales increase of 9% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Comparable store sales increased 10% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily a result of increased store traffic and improved conversion rates.\nWe generated net revenue of $32.7 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2018 from our company-operated stores segment.\nDirect to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $279.0 million to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2019 from $858.9 million in fiscal 2018. We generated net revenue of $20.3 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2018 from our direct to consumer segment. Based on a shifted calendar, direct to consumer net revenue increased 35%, or increased 35% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic on our e-commerce websites and improved conversion rates, partially offset by a decrease in dollar value per transaction.\nOther. Net revenue from our other segment increased $37.3 million, or 12%, to $340.4 million in fiscal 2019 from $303.1 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in net revenue from sales to wholesale accounts, and an increased number of temporary locations, including seasonal stores, open during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $407.1 million, or 22%, to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2019 from $1.8 billion in fiscal 2018.\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 70 basis points, to 55.9% in fiscal 2019 from 55.2% in fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase in product margin of 110 basis points, which was primarily due to lower product costs, a favorable mix of higher margin product, and lower markdowns.\nThis was partially offset by an increase in costs as a percentage of revenue related to our distribution centers and our product departments of 30 basis points, an increase in occupancy and depreciation costs as a percentage of revenue of 10 basis points, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 basis points.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $223.8 million, or 20%, to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2019 from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:\n\u2022\nan increase in costs related to our operating channels of $136.6 million, comprised of:\n-\nan increase in employee costs of $64.7 million primarily from a growth in labor hours and benefits, mainly associated with new company-operated stores and other new operating locations, and due to higher incentive compensation expenses;\n-\nan increase in variable costs of $49.2 million primarily due to an increase in distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging costs as a result of increased net revenue; and\n-\nan increase in other costs of $22.8 million primarily due to increases in digital marketing expenses, information technology costs, security, and other costs associated with our operating locations;\n\u2022\nan increase in head office costs of $84.3 million, comprised of:\n-\nan increase in employee costs of $43.0 million primarily due to increased incentive and stock-based compensation expense and due to increased wages, primarily from additional employees to support the growth in our business; and\n-\nan increase in other costs of $41.3 million primarily due to increases in depreciation, information technology costs, professional fees, brand and community costs, and other head office costs; and\n\u2022\nan increase in net foreign exchange and derivative revaluation losses of $2.9 million. There were net foreign exchange and derivative revaluation losses of $1.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared to net foreign exchange revaluation gains of $1.4 million in fiscal 2018.\nAs a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 30 basis points, to 33.5% in fiscal 2019 from 33.8% in fiscal 2018.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations increased $183.3 million, or 26%, to $889.1 million in fiscal 2019 from $705.8 million in fiscal 2018. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.3% compared to 21.5% in fiscal 2018.\nOn a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses.\nSegmented income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments.\nCompany-Operated Stores. Income from operations from our company-operated stores segment increased $113.8 million, or 20%, to $689.3 million for fiscal 2019 from $575.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $199.5 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increased employee costs, increased store operating expenses including higher credit card fees, distribution costs, and packaging costs as a result of higher net revenue, and due to increased security, repairs and maintenance costs, and information technology costs. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased by 50 basis points, primarily due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase in gross margin.\nDirect to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $128.3 million, or 36%, to $482.4 million in fiscal 2019 from $354.1 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $194.0 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher variable costs including distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging costs as a result of higher net revenue, as well as higher digital marketing expenses, information technology costs, and employee costs. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has increased by 120 basis points, primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by deleverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOther. Other income from operations increased $10.0 million, or 16%, to $72.6 million in fiscal 2019 from $62.6 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $13.6 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased employee costs, increased operating expenses including higher credit card fees and higher distribution costs as a result of higher net revenue, and due to higher repairs and maintenance costs and information technology costs. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased 70 basis points, primarily due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin.\nGeneral Corporate Expenses. General corporate expenses increased $68.8 million, or 24%, to $355.2 million in fiscal 2019 from $286.4 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily due to increases in head office employee costs, depreciation, brand and community costs, information technology costs, professional fees, and an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative losses of $2.9 million. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our company-operated stores, direct to consumer and other segments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThere was net other income of $8.3 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $9.4 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income, primarily from lower cash balances during the majority of fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in net other income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense, primarily the result of borrowings on our North American revolving credit facility during fiscal 2018. We did not have any borrowings on our revolving credit facilities during fiscal 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense increased $20.3 million, or 9%, to $251.8 million in fiscal 2019 from $231.4 million in fiscal 2018.\nU.S. tax reform was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law. We completed the accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform during fiscal 2018. This resulted in the recognition of an additional tax expense of $7.5 million related to the mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nIn fiscal 2018, we also completed our assessment of the impact that U.S. tax reform has upon repatriation taxes, our reinvestment plans, and the most efficient means of deploying our capital resources globally. We concluded that the net investment in a Canadian subsidiary in excess of the amounts necessary to sustain our business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested and $778.9 million was repatriated from that subsidiary. This resulted in the recognition of a tax expense of $23.7 million in fiscal 2018.\nFurther information on the adjustments recognized in fiscal 2018 is outlined in Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 28.1% compared to 32.4% for fiscal 2018. The effective tax rate excluding the above tax adjustments related to U.S. tax reform was 28.0% for fiscal 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to our adjusted effective tax rate in the prior year was primarily due to accruals for repatriation taxes on unremitted earnings and true-ups upon filing of tax returns. This was partially offset by a reduction in non-deductible stock-based compensation expense.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $161.8 million, or 33%, to $645.6 million in fiscal 2019 from $483.8 million in fiscal 2018. The increase in net income in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $407.1 million, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $223.8 million, an increase in income tax expense of $20.3 million, and a decrease in other income (expense), net of $1.1 million.\nComparable Sales\nWe separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open, or open after being significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months, and from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations or temporarily closed for over 30 days. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer, outlets, temporary locations, wholesale accounts, through license and supply arrangements, warehouse sales, and sales from company-operated stores that we have closed.\nWe use comparable store sales to assess the performance of our existing stores. It allows us to monitor the performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or expanded stores. We believe that investors would similarly find this metric useful in assessing the performance of our business.\nTotal comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales. We are evolving towards an omni-channel approach to support the shopping behavior of our guests. This involves country and region specific websites, mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, social media, product notification emails, and online order fulfillment through stores. Total comparable sales is an increasingly important metric to us as it allows us to evaluate the performance of our business from an omni-channel perspective. We therefore believe that reporting total comparable sales with comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales combined provides a relevant performance metric to investors.\nVarious factors affect comparable sales, including:\n\u2022\nthe location of new stores relative to existing stores;\n\u2022\nconsumer preferences, buying trends, foot traffic in the malls in which our stores are located, and overall economic trends;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel;\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\npricing;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nthe design and ease of use of our websites and mobile apps;\n\u2022\nthe level of customer service that we provide in our stores and on our websites and mobile apps;\n\u2022\nour ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and\n\u2022\nthe number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations), and expand in any period.\nIn fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of comparable sales. In the year following a 53 week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks.\nOpening new stores and expanding existing stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales is just one way of assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores opened, or significantly expanded, within the last 12 full fiscal months. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and the adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures.\nA constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue because we use these measures to understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. We believe that disclosing\nthese measures on a constant dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to understand the level of growth of our business.\nAdjusted income tax expense, effective tax rates, and diluted earnings per share exclude the amounts recognized in connection with U.S. tax reform and taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings. We believe these adjusted financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating the trend in our operating performance as the adjustments do not directly relate to our ongoing business operations. Furthermore, we do not believe the adjustments are reflective of our expectations of our future operating performance and believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because of their comparability to our historical information.\nThe presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\nConstant dollar changes in net revenue\nThe below changes in net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.\nConstant dollar changes in total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue\nDue to the 53rd week in fiscal 2018, the below changes in total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue are calculated on a one week shifted basis such that the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2020 are compared to the 52 weeks ended February 3, 2019 rather than January 27, 2019.\n__________\n(1)\nTotal comparable sales includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales.\n(2)\nComparable store sales reflects net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, or open for at least 12 full fiscal months after being significantly expanded.\nAdjusted financial measures\nThe following tables reconcile adjusted financial measures with the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments relate to the amounts recognized in connection with U.S. tax reform and taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings. Please refer to Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information on these adjustments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and capacity under our revolving credit facilities. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, investing in information technology and making system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions, as well as in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits.\nAs of February 2, 2020, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $94.0 million, our cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion and our capacity under our committed revolving credit facility was $398.2 million.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated:\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain items including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $73.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the following:\n\u2022\nan increase in cash used in operating activities of $306.9 million as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to the following:\n-\n$115.9 million related to income taxes, primarily due to payments for withholding taxes on repatriated foreign earnings, as well as timing of tax installments;\n-\n$86.8 million related to accounts payable, primarily due to a change in our payment terms in the prior fiscal year;\n-\n$51.0 million related to other prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets; and\n-\n$45.6 million related to inventory, primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases to support our growth.\nThis was partially offset by an increase of $161.8 million in net income, and an increase of $71.7 million in non-cash expenses primarily related to an increase in depreciation, stock-based compensation, the settlement of derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship, and deferred income taxes.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities relate to capital expenditures, the settlement of net investment hedges, and other investing activities. Cash used in investing activities increased $35.6 million, to $278.4 million in fiscal 2019 from $242.8 million in fiscal 2018.\nCapital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $171.5 million and $129.2 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, for opening new company-operated stores, and ongoing store refurbishment. The increase in capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment was primarily due to an increased amount spent on store remodels and relocations, including our experiential stores. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment also included $44.3 million to open 57 company-operated stores and $27.1 million to open 39 company-operated stores, in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively.\nCapital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $15.8 million and $6.4 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment in fiscal 2019 were primarily related to our new distribution center in Toronto, Canada as well as other information technology infrastructure and system initiatives, and in fiscal 2018 were primarily related to our global and region specific websites as well as mobile apps.\nCapital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $95.7 million and $90.2 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The capital expenditures in each fiscal year were primarily related to investments in information technology and business systems, improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used in financing activities consist primarily of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, certain cash flows related to stock-based compensation, and other financing activities.\nCash used in financing activities decreased $413.0 million, to $177.2 million in fiscal 2019 from $590.2 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in our stock repurchases.\nDuring the fiscal years ended February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, 1.1 million and 4.9 million, respectively, were repurchased under the programs at a total cost of $173.4 million and $598.3 million, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 1.0 million shares in a private transaction, and during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 3.3 million shares in a private transaction. The other common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facilities will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nNorth America revolving credit facility\nOn December 15, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for $150.0 million under a committed and unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. Bank of America, N.A., is administrative agent and HSBC Bank Canada is the syndication agent and letter of credit issuer, and the lenders party thereto. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made, in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, and in other currencies, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the lenders. Up to $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million is\navailable for the issuance of swing line loans. Commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by up to $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the lenders. Borrowings under the agreement may be prepaid and commitments may be reduced or terminated without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement, if any, will be due and payable in full on December 15, 2021, subject to provisions that permit us to request a limited number of one year extensions annually.\nBorrowings made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits on the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the borrowings are made (\"LIBOR\") or (b) an alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization, and rent (\"EBITDAR\") and ranges between 1.00%-1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0.00%-0.75% for alternate base rate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 0.125%-0.200%, also determined by reference to the pricing grid, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the revolving credit facility.\nThe credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all or substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions.\nWe are also required to maintain a consolidated rent-adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.50:1.00 and we are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) to be less than 2.00:1.00. The credit agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the credit agreement may be terminated, and the maturity of any outstanding amounts may be accelerated.\nOn June 6, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the credit agreement. The Amendment amends the credit agreement to provide for (i) an increase in the aggregate commitments under the unsecured five-year revolving credit facility to $400.0 million, with an increase of the sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit and extensions of swing line loans to $50.0 million for each, (ii) an increase in the option, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement, to request increases in commitments under the revolving facility from $400.0 million to $600.0 million and (iii) an extension in the maturity of the revolving facility from December 15, 2021 to June 6, 2023.\nIn addition, the Amendment decreases the applicable margins for LIBOR loans from 1.00%-1.75% to 1.00%-1.50% and for alternate base rate loans from 0.00%-0.75% to 0.00%-0.50%, reduces the commitment fee on average daily unused amounts under the revolving facility from 0.125%-0.200% to 0.10%-0.20%, and reduces fees for unused letters of credit from 1.00%-1.75% to 1.00%-1.50%.\nAs of February 2, 2020, aside from letters of credit of $1.8 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.\nMainland China revolving credit facility\nIn December 2019, the Company entered into an uncommitted and unsecured 130.0 million Chinese Yuan revolving credit facility. The terms are reviewed on an annual basis. The facility includes a revolving loan of up to 100.0 million Chinese Yuan as well as a financial bank guarantee facility of up to 30.0 million Chinese Yuan, or its equivalent in another currency. Loans are available in Chinese Yuan for a period not to exceed 12 months, and interest accrues on them at a rate equal to 105% of the applicable PBOC Benchmark Lending Rate. Guarantees have a commission equal to 1% per annum of the outstanding amount. The Company is required to follow certain covenants. As of February 2, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can be extended in five-year increments, if at all. The following table details the Company's future minimum lease payments. Minimum lease commitments exclude variable lease expenses including contingent rent payments, common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's insurance.\nPurchase obligations. The amounts listed for purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products and for other expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, values are subject to change, such as for product purchases throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets as of February 2, 2020.\nOne-time transition tax. As outlined in Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, U.S. tax reform imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The table below outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of February 2, 2020, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of February 2, 2020, letters of credit totaling $1.8 million had been issued.\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party and under which we have (i) any obligation under a guarantee, (ii) any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity, (iii) any obligation under derivative instruments that are indexed to our shares and classified as equity in our consolidated balance sheets, or (iv) any obligation arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of company-operated store net revenue, direct to consumer net revenue through websites and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, and other net revenue, which includes revenue from outlets, temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to licensees. All net revenue is reported net of sales taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities.\nWe record an estimated allowance for sales returns. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns, and any significant future known, or anticipated, events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns and an asset for estimated returned inventory. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 30 days after sale; however, we accept returns after 30 days where the product fails to meet our guests' quality expectations.\nProceeds from the sale of gift cards are initially deferred and recognized within \"Unredeemed gift card liability\" on the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when tendered for payment. To the extent there is no requirement to remit unclaimed card balances to government agencies, an estimate of the gift card balances that will never be redeemed is recognized as revenue in proportion to gift cards which have been redeemed. The estimate of gift cards that will never be redeemed is based on the historic trend of unredeemed cards.\nInventory provisions. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make a provision as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value\nbased upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which is individually assessed, and estimated to be up to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the declining balance method as follows:\nChanges in circumstances, such as technological advances, can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset's net book value to its estimated salvage value.\nLong-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition.\nDeferred taxes on undistributed net investment of foreign subsidiaries. We have not recognized U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the net investment in our subsidiaries which we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. This determination is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the projections are subject to revision in the future.\nFor the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that are not indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded a deferred tax liability for the taxes which would be due upon repatriation. For distributions made by our Canadian subsidiaries, the amount of tax payable is partially dependent on how the repatriation transactions are made. The deferred tax liability has been recorded on the basis that we would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be characterized for Canadian tax purposes as a return of capital, rather than as a dividend, and would not be subject to Canadian withholding tax.\nAs of February 2, 2020, the paid-up-capital balance of the Canadian subsidiaries for tax purposes was $1.5 billion. The net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries was $1.3 billion, of which $0.8 billion was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. The Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital such that we could choose to repatriate the portion of our net investment that is not indefinitely reinvested without paying Canadian withholding tax.\nDeferred tax liabilities of $1.5 million have been recognized in relation to the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, principally representing the U.S. state income taxes which would be due upon repatriation. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested amount is approximately $2.3 million.\nStock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant. Awards settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. The employee compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest.\nThe estimation of the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating the number of awards which are expected to vest, including, future profit forecasts, types of awards, size of option holder group, and anticipated employee retention and estimated expected forfeitures. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates.\nThe calculation of the grant-date fair value of stock options requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions, including, stock price volatility, and the expected life of the options. We evaluate and revise these estimates and assumptions as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. In the future, the expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record.\nContingencies. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.\nWe also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.\nAs of February 2, 2020, we had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. We also had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in an effort to reduce our exposure to the foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Please refer to Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information, including details of the notional amounts outstanding.\nIn the future, in an effort to reduce foreign exchange risks, we may enter into further derivative financial instruments including hedging additional currency pairs. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.\nWe currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:\n\u2022\nthe following impacts to the consolidated statements of operations:\n-\na decrease in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;\n-\na decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations upon translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;\n-\nforeign exchange revaluation gains by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities; and\n-\nderivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship;\n\u2022\nthe following impacts to the consolidated balance sheets:\n-\na decrease in the foreign currency translation adjustment which arises on the translation of our Canadian subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars; and\n-\nan increase in the foreign currency translation adjustment from derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts, entered into as net investment hedges of a Canadian subsidiary.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $4.6 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During fiscal 2018, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $83.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.\nA 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rates in effect for fiscal 2019 would have resulted in lower income from operations of approximately $4.6 million in fiscal 2019. This assumes a consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar throughout the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on our income from operations.\nInterest Rate Risk. Our committed revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to $400.0 million in the aggregate. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of February 2, 2020, aside from letters of credit of $1.8 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.\nOur cash and cash equivalent balances are held in the form of cash on hand, bank balances, short-term deposits and treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less, and in money market funds. We do not believe these balances are subject to material interest rate risk.\nCredit Risk. We have cash on deposit with various large, reputable financial institutions and have invested in U.S. and Canadian Treasury Bills, and in AAA-rated money market funds. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. We are also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions that are counterparties to our forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is our unrealized gains on our derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. We have not experienced any losses related to these items, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. We seek to minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom we transact. We seek to limit the amount of exposure with any one counterparty.\nInflation\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.",

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nlululemon athletica inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of lululemon athletica inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of lululemon athletica inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the 52 week period ended February 2, 2020, the 53 week period ended February 3, 2019, and the 52 week period ended January 28, 2018, including the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 52 week period ended February 2, 2020, the 53 week period ended February 3, 2019, and the 52 week period ended January 28, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases as of February 4, 2019.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of the Company's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInventory provision\nAs described in Note 2 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and management records a provision as necessary to appropriately value inventories that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. Provision expense is recorded in cost of goods sold. As of February 2, 2020, the Company's consolidated net inventories balance was $518.5 million and the inventory provision was $22.1 million. The amount of the inventory provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the inventory provision is a critical audit matter are (i) management identified the matter as a critical accounting estimate; and (ii) significant judgment was required by management in determining the estimated net realizable value of inventories that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged, which in turn led to increased audit effort and a higher degree of subjectivity in evaluating audit evidence relating to the estimate.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the review of the provision including the assumptions used. These procedures also included, among others: (i) observing the physical condition of inventories during inventory counts; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management's process for developing the estimates of net realizable value (iii) testing the reliability of reports used by management by agreeing to underlying records; (iv) testing the reasonableness of the assumptions about quality, damages, future demand, selling prices and market conditions by considering with historical trends and consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit; and corroborating the assumptions with individuals within the product team.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nVancouver, Canada\nMarch 26, 2020\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2006.\nlululemon athletica inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nlululemon athletica inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nlululemon athletica inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n(Amounts in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nlululemon athletica inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(Amounts in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nlululemon athletica inc.\nINDEX FOR NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1\nNature of Operations and Basis of Presentation\nNote 2\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNote 3\nInventories\nNote 4\nProperty and Equipment\nNote 5\nOther Non-Current Assets\nNote 6\nOther Current Liabilities\nNote 7\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nNote 8\nLong-Term Debt and Credit Facilities\nNote 9\nStockholders' Equity\nNote 10\nStock-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans\nNote 11\nFair Value Measurement\nNote 12\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nNote 13\nLeases\nNote 14\nAsset Impairment and Restructuring\nNote 15\nIncome Taxes\nNote 16\nEarnings Per Share\nNote 17\nCommitments and Contingencies\nNote 18\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nNote 19\nSegmented Information and Disaggregated Net Revenue\nNote 20\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nNote 21\nSubsequent Events\nlululemon athletica inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1.

The Company operates stores in the United States, Canada, the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\"), Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, Germany, South Korea, Singapore, France, Malaysia, Sweden, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. There were 491, 440, and 404 company-operated stores in operation as of February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company restructured its ivivva operations. Please refer to Note 14 for further details regarding the ivivva restructuring.\nPlease refer to Note 21 for further details on the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus on the Company's operations subsequent to February 2, 2020.\nBasis of presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been presented in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 were each 52 week years. Fiscal 2018 was a 53 week year. Fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 ended on February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.\nThe Company's business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail apparel businesses. Historically, the Company has recognized a significant portion of its operating profit in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year as a result of increased net revenue during the holiday season.\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the financial presentation adopted for the current year.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lululemon athletica inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, bank balances, and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these balances, and management believes the Company's credit risk to be minimal.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable primarily arise out of inventory duty receivables, sales to wholesale accounts, and license and supply arrangements. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management's best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. Receivables are written off against the allowance when management believes that the amount receivable will not be recovered. As of February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, the Company recorded an insignificant allowance for doubtful accounts.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of finished goods, inventories in transit, and raw materials, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs, and includes all costs incurred to deliver inventory to the Company's distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty, and other landing costs.\nThe Company periodically reviews its inventories and makes a provision as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of its inventory below its previous estimate, the Company would increase its reserve in the period in which it made such a determination.\nIn addition, the Company provides for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventory counts. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. The Company performs physical inventory counts and cycle counts throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation commences when an asset is ready for its intended use. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which is individually assessed, and estimated to be up to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease and the estimated useful life of the improvement, to a maximum of 10 years for stores and 15 years for corporate offices and distribution centers. All other property and equipment are depreciated using the declining balance method as follows:\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and the acquisition-date fair value of the Company's previously held equity interest over the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. The Company's operating segment for goodwill is its company-operated stores.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or a change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by discounting the future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined.\nLeased property and equipment\nAt lease commencement, which is generally when the Company takes possession of the asset, the Company records a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset. Lease liabilities represent the present value of minimum lease payments over the expected lease term, which includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain those options will be exercised. The present value of the lease liability is determined using the Company's incremental collateralized borrowing rate at the lease commencement.\nMinimum lease payments include base rent, fixed escalation of rental payments, and rental payments that are adjusted periodically depending on a rate or index. In determining minimum lease payments, the Company does not separate non-lease components for real estate leases. Non-lease components are generally services that the lessor performs for the Company associated with the leased asset, such as common area maintenance.\nRight-of-use assets represent the right to control the use of the leased asset during the lease and are initially recognized in an amount equal to the lease liability. In addition, prepaid rent, initial direct costs, and adjustments for lease incentives are components of the right-of-use asset. Over the lease term the lease expense is amortized on a straight-line basis beginning on the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment as part of the impairment of long-lived assets, which is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nVariable lease payments, including contingent rental payments based on sales volume, are recognized when the achievement of the specific target is probable. A right-of-use asset and lease liability are not recognized for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, and the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of asset retirement obligations (\"AROs\") when such obligations are incurred. The Company's AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease, the Company is contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, the Company records an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management's judgment, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company recognizes a liability for a cost associated with a lease exit or disposal activity when such obligation is incurred. A lease exit or disposal liability is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. The Company estimates fair value at the cease-use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals, reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, even where the Company does not intend to enter into a sublease. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from the assumptions used in the initial estimate.\nRevenue recognition\nNet revenue is comprised of company-operated store net revenue, direct to consumer net revenue through websites and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via the Company's distribution centers, and other net revenue, which includes revenue from outlets, temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of the Company's products to licensees. All revenue is reported net of sales taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Company's customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. Revenue from company-operated stores and other retail locations is recognized at the point of sale. Direct to consumer revenue and sales to wholesale accounts are recognized upon receipt by the customer. In certain arrangements the Company receives payment before the customer receives the promised good. These payments are initially recorded as deferred revenue, and recognized as revenue in the period when control is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue is presented net of an allowance for estimated returns, which is based on historic experience. The Company's liability for sales return refunds is recognized within other current liabilities, and an asset for the value of inventory which is expected to be returned is recognized within other prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nShipping fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue, and shipping costs are recognized within selling, general and administrative expenses in the same period the related revenue is recognized.\nProceeds from the sale of gift cards are initially deferred and recognized within unredeemed gift card liability on the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when tendered for payment. Based on historical experience, and to the extent there is no requirement to remit unclaimed card balances to government agencies, an estimate of the gift card balances that will never be redeemed is recognized as revenue in proportion to gift cards which have been redeemed.\nWhile the Company will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, management may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, the portion of card balances not expected to be redeemed are recognized in net\nrevenue in proportion to the gift cards which have been redeemed, under the redemption recognition method. For the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, net revenue recognized on unredeemed gift card balances was $11.9 million, $6.9 million, and $6.2 million, respectively.\nSee Note 19 for disaggregated net revenue by channel, geographic area, and product category.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold includes:\n\u2022\nthe cost of purchased merchandise, which includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable;\n\u2022\nthe cost incurred to deliver inventory to the Company's distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty, and other landing costs;\n\u2022\nthe cost of the Company's distribution centers, such as labor, rent, utilities, and depreciation;\n\u2022\nthe cost of the Company's production, design, research and development, distribution, and merchandising departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and other expenses;\n\u2022\noccupancy costs such as minimum rent, contingent rent where applicable, property taxes, utilities, and depreciation expense for the Company's company-operated store locations;\n\u2022\nhemming; and\n\u2022\nshrink and inventory provision expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold or asset impairment and restructuring costs. The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate and retail employee wages and benefits, costs to transport the Company's products from the distribution facilities to the Company's sales locations and e-commerce guests, professional fees, marketing, information technology, human resources, accounting, legal, corporate facility and occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization expense other than in cost of goods sold.\nFor the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, the Company incurred outbound transportation costs of $106.7 million, $79.5 million, and $53.8 million, respectively.\nAsset impairment and restructuring costs\nAsset impairment and restructuring costs consist of the lease termination, impairment of property and equipment, employee related costs, and other restructuring costs recognized in connection with the restructuring of the Company's ivivva operations.\nStore pre-opening costs\nOperating costs incurred prior to the opening of new stores are expensed as incurred as selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company follows the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for tax losses, tax credit carryforwards, and other tax attributes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates, for the appropriate tax jurisdiction, that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse.\nThe Company has not recognized U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which the Company has determined to be indefinitely reinvested.\nDeferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The evaluation as to the likelihood of realizing the benefit of a deferred income tax asset is based on the timing of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, taxable income forecasts, and tax-planning strategies. The recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several\nassumptions and forecasts, including current and anticipated taxable income, the utilization of previously unrealized non-operating loss carryforwards, and regulatory reviews of tax filings.\nThe Company evaluates its tax filing positions and recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is considered more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. This determination requires the use of significant judgment. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, facts or circumstances change, tax laws change, or new information becomes available. The Company's policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as part of other income (expense), net. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. tax reform\") was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law. The United States Securities Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (\"SAB 118\") which allowed companies to record provisional estimates of the impacts of U.S. tax reform within a one year measurement period. The Company recorded certain provisional amounts in fiscal 2017 and completed the accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform during fiscal 2018. U.S. tax reform changes and their impact to the Company are outlined in Note 15. The Company treats the global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") tax as an in period tax.\nFair value of financial instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are made using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value:\n\u2022\nLevel 1 - defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n\u2022\nLevel 2 - defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n\u2022\nLevel 3 - defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety by reference to its lowest level of significant input.\nThe Company records accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.\nThe Company holds certain assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which are outlined in Note 11.\nForeign currency\nThe functional currency for each entity included in these consolidated financial statements that is domiciled outside of the United States is generally the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities of each foreign entity are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Net revenue and expenses are translated at the average rate in effect during the period. Unrealized translation gains and losses are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment, which is included in other comprehensive income or loss, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss included in stockholders' equity.\nForeign currency transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency with any resulting gains and losses recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses, except for gains and losses arising on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature, which are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income or loss.\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain foreign currency exchange rate risks.\nNet investment hedges. The Company enters into certain forward currency contracts that are designated as net investment hedges. The effective portions of the hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, and will subsequently be reclassified to net earnings in the period in which the hedged investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Hedge effectiveness is measured using a method based on changes in forward exchange rates. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The Company also enters into certain forward currency contracts that are not designated as net investment hedges. They are designed to economically hedge the foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses of certain monetary assets and liabilities. The Company has not applied hedge accounting to these instruments and the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its forward currency contracts which are not designated in hedging relationships within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values within other prepaid expenses and other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. However, the Company's Master International Swap Dealers Association, Inc., Agreements and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Additional information on the Company's derivative financial instruments is included in Notes 11 and 12.\nConcentration of credit risk\nAccounts receivable are primarily from inventory duty receivables, wholesale accounts, and from license and supply arrangements. The Company does not require collateral to support the accounts receivable; however, in certain circumstances, the Company may require parties to provide payment for goods prior to delivery of the goods. The accounts receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is established based on management's assessment of the credit risk of the underlying accounts.\nCash and cash equivalents are held with high quality financial institutions. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. The Company is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is the Company's unrealized gains on its derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these items, and it believes credit risk to be minimal. The Company seeks to minimize its credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom it transacts. It seeks to limit the amount exposure with any one counterparty.\nThe Company's derivative contracts contain certain credit risk-related contingent features. Under certain circumstances, including an event of default, bankruptcy, termination, and cross default under the Company's North American revolving credit facility, the Company may be required to make immediate payment for outstanding liabilities under its derivative contracts.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant. Awards settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. The employee compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital for awards that are settled in common shares, and with the offsetting credit to accrued compensation and related expenses for awards that are settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee.\nFor awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards expected to vest, reflecting estimated expected forfeitures, and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. For awards with performance conditions, the Company recognizes the compensation expense if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance condition at each reporting date. The grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the award date using the Black-Scholes model, and the grant date fair value of restricted shares, performance-based restricted stock units, and restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the award date. Restricted stock units that are settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. This fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last business day before each period end.\nEarnings per share\nEarnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common and exchangeable shares outstanding during the period. Exchangeable shares are the equivalent of common shares in all material respects. All classes of stock have in effect the same rights and share equally in undistributed net income. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to stockholders for the period by the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution from common shares issuable through stock options, performance-based restricted stock units that have satisfied their performance factor, restricted shares, and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method.\nContingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. The Company records contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\") to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a lease liability, which represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASC 842 on February 4, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach with no restatement of comparative periods.\nThe Company has chosen to apply the transition package of three practical expedients which allow companies not to reassess whether agreements contain leases, the classification of leases, and the capitalization of initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the practical expedient to use hindsight when determining the lease term.\nThe primary financial statement impact upon adoption was the recognition, on a discounted basis, of the Company's minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases as right-of-use assets and obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. As of February 4, 2019, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were $619.6 million and $651.1 million, respectively. Pre-existing lease balances of $34.8 million from current assets, $9.3 million from non-current assets, and $75.5 million from non-current liabilities were reclassified to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as part of the adoption of the new standard. There was no cumulative earnings effect adjustment on transition.\nIn August 2017, the FASB amended ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to more closely align hedge accounting with companies' risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs. It makes more financial and non-financial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and it did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB clarified ASC 350-40, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software, for certain aspects of accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. Under the update, an entity expenses costs incurred in the preliminary-project and post-implementation-operation stages. An entity also capitalizes certain costs incurred during the application-development stage, as well as certain costs related to enhancements. The ASU does not change the accounting for the service component of a cloud computing arrangement. This standard is effective beginning in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and it did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605 Revenue Recognition. This ASU requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 29, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. There were no changes to the consolidated statement of operations as a result of the adoption, and the timing and amount of its revenue recognition remained substantially unchanged under this new guidance.\nNOTE 3. INVENTORIES\nThe Company had net write-offs of $28.6 million, $25.3 million, and $16.4 million of inventory in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2017, respectively for goods that were obsolete, had quality issues, or were damaged.\nNOTE 4. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nIncluded in the cost of computer software are capitalized costs of $20.7 million and $13.2 million as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, respectively, associated with internally developed software.\nDepreciation expense related to property and equipment was $161.8 million, $122.4 million, and $108.0 million for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.\nSee Note 14 for information on the impairment of long-lived assets the Company recognized as part of the restructuring of its ivivva operations.\nNOTE 5. OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS\nNOTE 6. OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\nNOTE 7. OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES\nNOTE 8. LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\nNorth America revolving credit facility\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company entered into a $150.0 million committed and unsecured revolving credit facility. Any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility will be due and payable in full on December 15, 2021, subject to provisions that permit the Company to request a limited number of one year extensions annually.\nUp to $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million is available for swing line loans. Commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by up to $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the lenders.\nBorrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, and in other currencies, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the lenders. Borrowings under the agreement may be prepaid and commitments may be reduced or terminated without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs).\nBorrowings made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, either (a) LIBOR or (b) an alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and rent (\"EBITDAR\") and ranges between 1.00%-1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0.00%-0.75% for alternate base rate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 0.125%-0.200%, also determined by reference to the pricing grid, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the revolving credit facility.\nThe credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all or substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions.\nThe Company is also required to maintain a consolidated rent-adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.50:1.00 and it is not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) to be less than 2.00:1.00. The credit agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). As of February 2, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nOn June 6, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the credit agreement. The Amendment amends the credit agreement to provide for (i) an increase in the aggregate commitments under the unsecured five-year revolving credit facility to $400.0 million, with an increase of the sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit and extensions of swing line loans to $50.0 million for each, (ii) an increase in the option, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement, to request increases in commitments under the revolving facility from $400.0 million to $600.0 million and (iii) an extension in the maturity of the revolving facility from December 15, 2021 to June 6, 2023.\nIn addition, the Amendment decreases the applicable margins for LIBOR loans from 1.00%-1.75% to 1.00%-1.50% and for alternate base rate loans from 0.00%-0.75% to 0.00%-0.50%, reduces the commitment fee on average daily unused amounts under the revolving facility from 0.125%-0.200% to 0.10%-0.20%, and reduces fees for unused letters of credit from 1.00%-1.75% to 1.00%-1.50%.\nAs of February 2, 2020, aside from letters of credit of $1.8 million, there were no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.\nMainland China revolving credit facility\nIn December 2019, the Company entered into an uncommitted and unsecured 130.0 million Chinese Yuan revolving credit facility. The terms are reviewed on an annual basis. The facility includes a revolving loan of up to 100.0 million Chinese Yuan as well as a financial bank guarantee facility of up to 30.0 million Chinese Yuan, or its equivalent in another currency. Loans are available in Chinese Yuan for a period not to exceed 12 months, and interest accrues on them at a rate equal to 105% of the applicable PBOC Benchmark Lending Rate. Guarantees have a commission equal to 1% per annum of the outstanding amount. The Company is required to follow certain covenants. As of February 2, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.\nNOTE 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nSpecial voting stock and exchangeable shares\nThe holders of the special voting stock are entitled to one vote for each share held. The special voting shares are not entitled to receive dividends or distributions or receive any consideration in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or wind-up. To the extent that exchangeable shares as described below are exchanged for common stock, a corresponding number of special voting shares will be cancelled without consideration.\nThe holders of the exchangeable shares have dividend and liquidation rights equivalent to those of holders of the common shares of the Company. The exchangeable shares can be converted on a one for one basis by the holder at any time into common shares of the Company plus a cash payment for any accrued and unpaid dividends. Holders of exchangeable shares are entitled to the same or economically equivalent dividend as declared on the common stock of the Company. The exchangeable shares are non-voting. The Company has the right to convert the exchangeable shares into common shares of the Company at any time after the earliest of July 26, 2047, the date on which fewer than 4.2 million exchangeable shares are outstanding, or in the event of certain events such as a change in control.\nNOTE 10. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS\nStock-based compensation plans\nThe Company's eligible employees participate in various stock-based compensation plans, which are provided by the Company directly.\nIn June 2014, the Company's stockholders approved the adoption of the lululemon athletica inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2014 Plan\"). The 2014 Plan provides for awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted share bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance-based restricted stock units, cash-based awards, other stock-based awards, and deferred compensation awards to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees), consultants, and directors of the Company.\nThe awards granted under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2007 Plan\") remain outstanding and continue to vest under their original conditions. No further awards will be granted under the 2007 Plan.\nThe Company has granted stock options, performance-based restricted stock units, restricted stock units, and restricted shares. Stock options granted to date generally have a four-year vesting period and vest at a rate of 25% each year on the anniversary date of the grant. Stock options generally expire on the earlier of seven years from the date of grant, or a specified period of time following termination, in accordance with the 2014 Plan and the related grant agreement. Performance-based restricted stock units issued generally vest three years from the grant date and restricted shares generally vest one year from the\ngrant date. Restricted stock units granted generally have a three-year vesting period and vest at a certain percentage each year on the anniversary date of the grant.\nThe Company issues previously unissued shares upon the exercise of Company options, vesting of performance-based restricted stock units or restricted stock units that are settled in common stock, and granting of restricted shares.\nStock-based compensation expense charged to income for the plans was $46.1 million, $29.6 million, and $17.6 million for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost for all stock-based compensation plans was $63.4 million as of February 2, 2020, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years, and was $55.6 million as of February 3, 2019 over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.\nA summary of the balances of the Company's stock-based compensation plans as of February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, and changes during the fiscal years then ended is presented below:\nA total of 13.3 million shares of the Company's common stock have been authorized for future issuance under the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.\nThe Company's performance-based restricted stock units are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive a maximum of two shares of common stock per performance-based restricted stock unit if the Company achieves specified performance goals and the grantee remains employed during the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the award date. Expense for performance-based restricted stock units is recognized when it is probable that the performance goal will be achieved.\nThe grant date fair value of the restricted shares and restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the award date. Restricted stock units that are settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. This fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last business day before each period end.\nThe grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Company's historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon the historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following are weighted averages of the assumptions that were used in calculating the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable as of February 2, 2020:\nAs of February 2, 2020, the unrecognized compensation cost related to these options was $17.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018 was $54.09, $30.30, and $16.88, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the intrinsic value of options exercised and awards that vested during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nEmployee share purchase plan\nThe Company's board of directors and stockholders approved the Company's Employee Share Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") in September 2007. Contributions are made by eligible employees, subject to certain limits defined in the ESPP, and the Company matches one-third of the contribution. The maximum number of shares authorized to be purchased under the ESPP is 6.0\nmillion shares. All shares purchased under the ESPP are purchased in the open market. During the year ended February 2, 2020, there were 0.1 million shares purchased.\nDefined contribution pension plans\nThe Company offers defined contribution pension plans to its eligible employees. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to a plan up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws. The Company matches 50% to 75% of the contribution depending on the participant's length of service, and the contribution is subject to a two year vesting period. The Company's net expense for the defined contribution plans was $8.5 million, $6.4 million, and $5.2 million for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.\nNOTE 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nAs of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, the Company held certain assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nThe Company records accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.\nThe Company has short-term, highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents, which are invested in money market funds, Treasury bills, and term deposits. The Company records cash equivalents at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate.\nThe fair values of the forward currency contract assets and liabilities are determined using observable Level 2 inputs, including foreign currency spot exchange rates, forward pricing curves, and interest rates. The fair values consider the credit risk of the Company and its counterparties. The Company's Master International Swap Dealers Association, Inc., Agreements and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions. However, the Company records all derivatives on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value and does not offset derivative assets and liabilities.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company has impaired certain long-lived assets and recorded them at their estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis. The fair value of these long-lived assets was determined using Level 3 inputs, principally the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from their\nuse and eventual disposition. Please refer to Note 14 for further details regarding the impairment of long-lived assets as a result of the ivivva restructuring.\nThe Company has also recorded lease termination liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis, determined using Level 3 inputs based on remaining lease rentals and reduced by estimated sublease income.\nNOTE 12. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company currently hedges against changes in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate and changes in the Chinese Yuan to U.S. dollar exchange rate using forward currency contracts.\nNet investment hedges\nThe Company holds a significant portion of its assets in Canada and during the year ended February 2, 2020, it entered into forward currency contracts designed to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. These forward currency contracts are designated as net investment hedges. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges for the year ended February 2, 2020.\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nDuring the year ended February 2, 2020 the Company entered into certain forward currency contracts designed to economically hedge the foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by its Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities.\nQuantitative disclosures about derivative financial instruments\nThe notional amounts and fair values of forward currency contracts were as follows:\nAs of February 2, 2020, there were derivative assets of $1.7 million and derivative liabilities of $1.9 million subject to enforceable netting arrangements.\nThe forward currency contracts designated as net investment hedges mature on different dates between February 2020 and August 2020.\nThe forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship mature on different dates between February 2020 and August 2020.\nThe pre-tax gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows:\nNo gains or losses have been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into net income for derivative financial instruments in a net investment hedging relationship, as the Company has not sold or liquidated (or substantially liquidated) its hedged subsidiary.\nThe pre-tax net foreign exchange and derivative gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statement of operations are as follows:\nNOTE 13. LEASES\nThe Company has obligations under operating leases for its store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment. As of February 2, 2020, the lease terms of the various leases range from two to fifteen years. The majority of the Company's leases include renewal options at the sole discretion of the Company. In general, it is not reasonably certain that lease renewals will be exercised at lease commencement and therefore lease renewals are not included in the lease term.\nThe following table details the Company's net lease expense. Certain of the Company's leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays, and leasehold rental incentives. The majority of the Company's leases for store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume. The variable lease expenses disclosed below include contingent rent payments and other non-fixed lease related costs, including common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's insurance.\nThe following table presents future minimum lease payments and the impact of discounting.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate were as follows:\nDisclosures related to periods prior to adoption of ASC 842\nThe following table details the Company's total rent expense prior to the adoption of ASC 842 as well as the property taxes for leased locations.\nThe table below summarizes the Company's contractual arrangements as of February 3, 2019, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Minimum annual basic rent payments excluding other executory operating costs, pursuant to lease agreements are approximately as laid out in the table below. These amounts include commitments in respect of lease agreements that have been executed, but have not yet commenced.\nNOTE 14. ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company restructured its ivivva operations. On August 20, 2017, the Company closed 48 of its 55 ivivva branded company-operated stores and all other ivivva branded temporary locations. As a result of this restructuring, the Company recognized aggregate pre-tax charges of $47.2 million during fiscal 2017.\nA summary of the pre-tax charges recognized in connection with the Company's restructuring of its ivivva operations is as follows:\nIncome tax recoveries of $12.7 million were recorded on the above items in fiscal 2017. These income tax recoveries are based on the annual tax rate of the applicable tax jurisdictions.\nCosts recorded in cost of goods sold\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recognized expenses of $8.7 million in cost of goods sold as a result of the restructuring of its ivivva operations. This included $4.9 million to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value, and $3.8 million in accelerated depreciation primarily related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for stores that were closed on August 20, 2017.\nCosts recorded in operating expenses\nThe Company recognized asset impairment and restructuring costs of $38.5 million during fiscal 2017 as a result of the restructuring of its ivivva operations.\nAs a result of the plan to close the majority of the ivivva branded locations, the long-lived assets of each ivivva branded location were tested for impairment as of April 30, 2017. For impaired locations, a loss was recognized representing the difference between the net book value of the long-lived assets and their estimated fair value. Impairment losses totaling $11.6 million were recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These losses primarily relate to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures of the company-operated stores segment. These assets were retired during fiscal 2017 in conjunction with the closures of the company-operated stores.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recognized lease termination costs of $21.1 million, employee related expenses as a result of the restructuring of $4.2 million as well as other restructuring costs of $1.6 million.\nNOTE 15. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company's domestic and foreign income before income tax expense and current and deferred income taxes from federal, state, and foreign sources are as follows:\nThe Company's income tax expense for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 included certain discrete tax amounts, as follows:\nU.S. tax reform\nThe U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 introduced significant changes to the U.S. income tax laws, including reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a shift to a territorial tax system which changed how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax, and the imposition of a mandatory one-time transition tax on the accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nOne-time transition tax. U.S. tax reform required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% on cash and cash equivalents and 8% on the remaining earnings, net of foreign tax credits. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recognized a provisional amount of $58.9 million for the mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result of completing its fiscal 2017 U.S. tax returns and incorporating newly issued guidance into its calculations the Company recognized an additional current tax expense of $7.5 million during fiscal 2018 for the mandatory one-time transition tax.\nDeferred income tax effects. U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Accordingly, the Company remeasured its deferred income tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduced rate that is expected to apply in future\nperiods when these balances reverse. The Company recognized a provisional deferred income tax expense of $0.4 million during fiscal 2017 to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of U.S. tax reform. There were no adjustments to this provisional amount in fiscal 2018.\nThe Company completed the accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform in fiscal 2018.\nTax on repatriation from foreign subsidiaries\nU.S. tax reform and the shift to a territorial tax system in fiscal 2017 eliminated U.S. federal income taxes upon the repatriation of foreign earnings. However, U.S. tax reform did not eliminate foreign withholding taxes, or certain state income taxes.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company completed its evaluation of the impact that U.S. tax reform has upon repatriation taxes, its reinvestment plans, and the most efficient means of deploying its capital resources. As a result of these evaluations, the Company repatriated $778.9 million from a Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. parent entity in fiscal 2018. A net tax current expense of $23.7 million was recognized in fiscal 2018 on this distribution.\nAs at February 2, 2020, the Company's net investment in its Canadian subsidiaries was $1.3 billion, of which $0.8 billion was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. A deferred tax liability of $1.5 million has been recognized in relation to the portion of the Company's net investment in its Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, principally representing the U.S. state income taxes which would be due upon repatriation. This deferred tax liability has been recorded on the basis that the Company would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be characterized as a return of capital for Canadian tax purposes, and therefore not subject to Canadian withholding tax. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested amount is approximately $2.3 million.\nNo deferred income tax liabilities have been recognized on any of the undistributed earnings of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States. Excluding its Canadian subsidiaries, cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries as of February 2, 2020 were $52.1 million.\nAs of February 2, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $387.4 million outside of the United States.\nTax recovery on ivivva restructuring costs\nAs outlined in Note 14, the Company restructured its ivivva operations during fiscal 2017. Income tax recoveries of $12.7 million were recorded on total restructuring costs of $47.2 million in fiscal 2017. These income tax recoveries are based on the tax rate of the applicable tax jurisdictions.\nA summary reconciliation of the effective tax rate is as follows:\nThe Company's U.S. federal income tax rate of 33.9% for the year ended January 28, 2018 was a blended rate that includes the rate decrease which became effective on January 1, 2018.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019 are presented below:\nAs of February 2, 2020, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $9.7 million. The majority of the net operating loss carryforwards expire, if unused, between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2039.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S., Canada, and various foreign, state, and provincial jurisdictions. The 2016 to 2018 tax years remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The 2013 tax year is still open for certain state tax authorities. The 2010 to 2018 tax years remain subject to examination by Canadian tax authorities. The 2012 to 2018 tax years remain subject to examination by tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in the Company's tax returns.\nNOTE 16. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe details of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:\nThe Company's calculation of weighted-average shares includes the common stock of the Company as well as the exchangeable shares. Exchangeable shares are the equivalent of common shares in all material respects. All classes of stock have in effect the same rights and share equally in undistributed net income. For the fiscal years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, 48.0 thousand, 32.2 thousand, and 0.1 million stock options and awards, respectively, were anti-dilutive to earnings per share and therefore have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.\nOn December 1, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved a program to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock up to an aggregate value of $100.0 million. This stock repurchase program was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. On November 29, 2017, the Company's board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $200.0 million and on June 6, 2018, the board of directors approved an increase to this stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to a total of $600.0 million of the Company's common shares. These programs were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nOn January 31, 2019, the Company's board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $500.0 million of the Company's common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Common shares repurchased on the open market are at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing and actual number of common shares to be repurchased will depend upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, and the repurchase program is expected to be completed by January 2021. As of February 2, 2020, the remaining value of shares available to be repurchased under this program was $327.3 million.\nDuring the fiscal years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, 1.1 million, 4.9 million, and 1.9 million shares, respectively, were repurchased under the programs at a total cost of $173.4 million, $598.3 million, and $100.3 million, respectively.\nSubsequent to February 2, 2020, and up to March 20, 2020, 0.2 million shares were repurchased at a total cost of $33.8 million.\nNOTE 17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nLeases. The Company has obligations under operating leases for its store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment. Please refer to Note 13 for further details regarding lease commitments and the timing of future minimum lease payments.\nLicense and supply arrangements. The Company has entered into license and supply arrangements with partners in the Middle East and Mexico which grant them the right to operate lululemon branded retail locations in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and Mexico. The Company retains the rights to sell lululemon products through its e-commerce websites in these countries. Under these arrangements, the Company supplies the partners with lululemon products, training, and other support. The initial term of the agreement for the Middle East expired in January 2020 and the Company currently intends to stay in the market. The initial term of the agreement for Mexico expires in November 2026. As of February 2, 2020, there were four licensed retail locations in Mexico, three in the United Arab Emirates, and one in Qatar.\nOne-time transition tax. As outlined in Note 15, U.S. tax reform imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The Company recognized a provisional income tax expense of $58.9 million in fiscal\n2017 and an additional expense of $7.5 million during fiscal 2018 for the mandatory transition tax. The one-time transition tax payable is net of foreign tax credits, and the table below outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual arrangements as of February 2, 2020, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nContingencies\nLegal proceedings. In addition to the legal proceedings described below, the Company is, from time to time, involved in routine legal matters, and audits and inspections by governmental agencies and other third parties which are incidental to the conduct of its business. This includes legal matters such as initiation and defense of proceedings to protect intellectual property rights, personal injury claims, product liability claims, employment claims, and similar matters. The Company believes the ultimate resolution of any such legal proceedings, audits, and inspections will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated balance sheets, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn October 9, 2015, certain current and former hourly employees of the Company filed a class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of New York entitled Rebecca Gathmann-Landini et al v. lululemon USA inc. On December 2, 2015, the case was moved to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The lawsuit alleges that the Company violated various New York labor codes by failing to pay all earned wages, including overtime compensation. The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of damages. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter.\nOn November 21, 2018, plaintiff David Shabbouei filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery a derivative lawsuit on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company's current and former directors and officers, captioned David Shabbouei v. Laurent Potdevin, et al., 2018-0847-JRS. Plaintiff claims that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by allegedly failing to address alleged sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and related conduct at the Company. Plaintiff also claims that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and wasted corporate assets with respect to the separation agreement entered into by the Company and Laurent Potdevin in connection with his departure from the Company in February 2018. Plaintiff also further brings an unjust enrichment claim against Mr. Potdevin with respect to the separation agreement. Plaintiff seeks unspecified money damages for the Company for the defendants' alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment, disgorgement of all profits, benefits and other compensation Mr. Potdevin received as a result of defendants' alleged conduct for the Company, an order directing the Company to implement corporate governance and internal procedures, and an award of plaintiff's attorneys' fees, costs and expenses. The defendants and the Company have moved to dismiss the action.\nNOTE 18. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nNOTE 19. SEGMENTED INFORMATION AND DISAGGREGATED NET REVENUE\nThe Company applies ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting (\"ASC 280\"), in determining reportable segments for its financial statement disclosure. The Company reports segments based on the financial information it uses in managing its business. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of company-operated stores and direct to consumer. Direct to consumer represents sales from the Company's e-commerce websites and mobile apps. Outlets, temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, license and supply arrangements, and warehouse sale net revenue have been combined into other. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reviewed its general corporate expenses and determined certain costs which were previously classified as general corporate expense are more appropriately classified within the direct to consumer segment. Accordingly, comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the financial presentation adopted for the current year.\nThe accelerated depreciation related to the restructuring of the ivivva operations is included in corporate and other in the above breakdown of depreciation and amortization.\nIntercompany amounts are excluded from the above table as they are not included in the materials reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.\nThe Company's goodwill relates to the reporting segment consisting of company-operated stores.\nThe following table disaggregates the Company's net revenue by geographic area for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018.\nProperty and equipment, net by geographic area as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019 were as follows:\nThe following table disaggregates the Company's net revenue by category for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018.\nNOTE 20. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\nThe following tables present the Company's unaudited quarterly results of operations and comprehensive income for each of the quarters in the fiscal years ended February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019. The following tables should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. The Company has prepared the information below on a basis consistent with its audited consolidated financial statements and has included all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of the Company's management, are necessary to fairly present its operating results for the quarters presented. The Company's historical unaudited quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarter or for a full year.\nThe Company's quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, the Company believes that comparisons of its quarterly results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of the Company's future performance.\nNOTE 21. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluates events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date through to the date which the financial statements are issued, for potential recognition or disclosure in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and continues to spread in the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. Subsequent to February 2, 2020, in line with recommendations by public health officials and in accordance with governmental authority orders, the Company has taken actions to close certain retail locations and to reduce operating hours.\nIn February 2020, the Company temporarily closed all of its retail locations in Mainland China. All but one of these locations have since reopened. In March 2020, the Company temporarily closed all of its retail locations in North America, Europe, Malaysia, New Zealand, and it temporarily closed its distribution center in Sumner, WA. These locations currently remain closed.\nThe Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this pandemic, but currently anticipates a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in fiscal 2020.",

    "item_9A": "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report, or the Evaluation Date. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource limitations on all control systems; no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on\nthis evaluation, management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART III",
