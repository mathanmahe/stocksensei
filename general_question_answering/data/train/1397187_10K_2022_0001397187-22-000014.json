    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nlululemon athletica inc. is principally a designer, distributor, and retailer of healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel and accessories. We have a vision to be the experiential brand that ignites a community of people through sweat, grow, and connect, which we call \"living the sweatlife.\" Since our inception, we have fostered a distinctive corporate culture; we promote a set of core values in our business which include taking personal responsibility, nurturing entrepreneurial spirit, acting with honesty and courage, valuing connection and inclusion, and choosing to have fun. These core values attract passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals, and share our purpose \"to elevate the world by realizing the full potential within every one of us.\"\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022, lululemon athletica inc. (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as \"lululemon,\" \"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our.\" We refer to the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022 as \"2021\" and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 as \"2020.\"\nComponents of this discussion of our business include:\n\u2022Our Products\n\u2022Our Market\n\u2022Our Segments\n\u2022Community-Based Marketing\n\u2022Product Design and Development\n\u2022Sourcing and Manufacturing\n\u2022Distribution Facilities\n\u2022Competition\n\u2022Seasonality\n\u2022Human Capital\n\u2022Intellectual Property\n\u2022Securities and Exchange Commission Filings\nOur Products\nOur healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel and accessories are marketed under the lululemon brand. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories. Our apparel assortment includes items such as pants, shorts, tops, and jackets\ndesigned for a healthy lifestyle including athletic activities such as yoga, running, training, and most other sweaty pursuits. We also offer a range of products designed for being On the Move, fitness-related accessories, and footwear. We expect to continue to broaden our merchandise offerings through expansion across these product areas.\nOur design and development team continues to source technically advanced fabrics, with new feel and fit, and craft innovative functional features for our products. Through our vertical retail strategy and direct connection with our customers, whom we refer to as guests, we are able to collect feedback and incorporate unique performance and fashion needs into our design process. In this way, we believe we are better positioned to address the needs of our guests, helping us advance our product lines and differentiate us from the competition.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we acquired Curiouser Products Inc., dba MIRROR. MIRROR is an in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform that features live and on-demand classes. The acquisition of MIRROR bolsters our digital sweatlife offerings and brings immersive and personalized in-home sweat and mindfulness content to new and existing lululemon guests.\nOur Market\nOur guests seek a combination of performance, style, and sensation in their athletic apparel, choosing products that allow them to feel great however they exercise. Since consumer purchase decisions are driven by both an actual need for functional products and a desire to live a particular lifestyle, we believe the credibility of our brand and the authentic community experiences we offer expand our potential market beyond just athletes to those who pursue an active, mindful, and balanced life.\nAlthough our largest customer group is made up of guests who shop our women's range, representing 67% of our 2021 net revenue, we also design a comprehensive men's line and have a targeted strategy in place. Revenue from men's range is growing as more guests discover the technical rigor and premium quality of our men's products, and are attracted by our distinctive brand.\nNorth America is our largest market by geographical split, representing 85% of our 2021 net revenue. We are expanding internationally across the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\"), the rest of Asia Pacific, and Europe. We are expanding in these regions via a decentralized model, allowing for local community insight and consumer preference to inform our strategic expansion.\nOur Segments\nWe primarily conduct our business through two channels: company-operated stores and direct to consumer.\nWe also operate outlets and temporary locations, conduct business through MIRROR, serve certain wholesale accounts, have license and supply arrangements, and hold warehouse sales from time to time. The financial results of these operations are disclosed in Other.\nCompany-Operated Stores\nAt the end of 2021, we operated 574 stores in 17 countries across the globe. In addition to being a venue to sell our products, our stores give us a direct connection to our guest, which we view as a valuable tool in helping us build our brand and product line. Our retail stores are located primarily on street locations, in lifestyle centers, and in malls.\n__________\n(1)PRC included nine stores in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, five stores in Taiwan, and two stores in Macao Special Administration Region, as of January 30, 2022. As of January 31, 2021, there were seven stores in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, two stores in Macao Special Administration Region, and two stores in Taiwan.\nWe opened 53 net new company-operated stores in 2021, including 43 net new stores outside of North America.\nWe perform ongoing evaluations of our portfolio of company-operated store locations. During 2021, we closed three of our lululemon branded company-operated stores. As we continue our evaluations we may, in the future, close or relocate additional company-operated stores.\nIn fiscal 2022, our new store growth will come primarily from company-operated store openings in Asia and in the United States. Our real estate strategy over the next several years will not only consist of opening new company-operated stores, but also in overall square footage growth through store expansions and relocations.\nWe believe that our innovative retail concept and guest experience contribute to the success of our stores. We use sales per square foot to assess the performance of our company-operated stores relative to their square footage. We believe that sales per square foot is useful in evaluating the performance of our company-operated stores. Our sales per square foot for 2021 was $1,443. As a significant number of our stores were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 during the first two quarters of 2020, we do not believe sales per square foot for 2020 is useful to investors in understanding performance, therefore we have not included this metric.\nSales per square foot is calculated using total net revenue from all company-operated stores divided by the average square footage of the stores during the year. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of sales per square foot. The square footage of our company-operated stores includes all retail related space, storage areas, and administrative space used by the store employees. It excludes any space used for non-retail related activities. The sales per square foot metric we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies.\nDirect to Consumer\nWe believe that e-commerce is convenient for our core guest and enhances the image of our brand. Our direct to consumer channel also allows us to reach and serve guests in markets beyond where our physical retail locations are based. We believe this channel is effective in building brand awareness, especially in new markets.\nWe serve our guests via our e-commerce website www.lululemon.com, other country and region-specific websites, and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers or other retail locations.\nWe continue to evolve and integrate our digital and physical channels in order to enrich our interactions with our guests, and to provide an enhanced omni-channel experience.\nOther\nOur other operations primarily include:\n\u2022Outlets and warehouse sales - We utilize outlets as well as physical warehouse sales, which are held from time to time, to sell slow moving inventory and inventory from prior seasons at discounted prices. As of January 30, 2022, we operated 37 outlets, with the majority in North America.\n\u2022Temporary locations - Our temporary locations, including pop ups, are typically opened for a short period of time. We believe these retail locations enable us to serve guests during peak shopping periods in markets where we do not ordinarily have a physical location, or enable us to better serve our guest in markets where we see high demand at our existing locations.\n\u2022MIRROR - We offer in-home fitness through an interactive workout platform that allows our guests to subscribe for live and on-demand classes.\n\u2022Wholesale - Our wholesale accounts include premium yoga studios, health clubs, and fitness centers. We believe these premium wholesale locations offer an alternative distribution channel that is convenient for our core guest and enhances the image of our brand. We do not intend wholesale to be a significant contributor to overall sales. Instead, we use the channel to build brand awareness, including outside of North America.\n\u2022License and supply arrangements - We enter into license and supply arrangements from time to time when we believe that it will be to our advantage to partner with companies and individuals with significant experience and proven success in certain target markets.\nWe have license and supply arrangements with partners in the Middle East and Mexico which grant them the right to operate lululemon branded retail locations in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and Mexico. We retain the rights to sell lululemon products through our e-commerce websites in these countries. Under these arrangements we supply the partners with lululemon products, training and other support. An extension to the initial term of the agreement for the Middle East was signed in 2020 and it extends the arrangement to December 2024. The initial term of the agreement for Mexico expires in November 2026. As of January 30, 2022, there were 14 licensed locations, including six in Mexico, six in the United Arab Emirates, one in Kuwait, and one in Qatar, which are not included in the above company-operated stores table.\nCommunity-Based Marketing\nWe utilize a community-based approach to build brand awareness and guest loyalty. We pursue a multi-faceted strategy which leverages our local teams and ambassadors, digital marketing and social media, in-store community boards, and a variety of grassroots initiatives. We complement and amplify our community-based initiatives with global brand-building activity.\nProduct Design and Development\nOur product design and development efforts are led by a team of researchers, scientists, engineers, and designers. Our team is comprised of athletes and users of our products who embody our design philosophy and dedication to premium quality. Our design and development team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the input of our guests and our ambassadors, and broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of function, style, and technical superiority.\nAs we strive to continue to provide our guests with technically advanced fabrics, our team works closely with our suppliers to incorporate the latest in technical innovation, bringing particular specifications to our products. We partner with independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety of tests on our fabrics, testing performance characteristics including pilling, shrinkage, abrasion resistance, and colorfastness. We develop proprietary fabrics and collaborate with leading fabric and trims suppliers to manufacture fabrics and trims that we ultimately protect through agreements, trademarks, and trade-secrets.\nSourcing and Manufacturing\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide fabrics for, and to produce, our products. The following statistics are based on cost.\nWe work with a group of approximately 41 vendors that manufacture our products, five of which produced 57% of our products in 2021, with the largest manufacturer producing 15%. During 2021, 40% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 17% in Cambodia, 11% in Sri Lanka, 7% in the PRC, including 2% in Taiwan, and the remainder in other regions.\nWe work with a group of approximately 65 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. In 2021, 56% of our fabrics were produced by our top five fabric suppliers, with the largest manufacturer producing 27%. During 2021, 48% of our fabrics originated from Taiwan, 19% from Mainland China, 11% from Sri Lanka, and the remainder from other regions.\nWe also source other raw materials which are used in our products, including items such as content labels, elastics, buttons, clasps, and drawcords from suppliers located predominantly in the Asia Pacific region.\nWe have developed long-standing relationships with a number of our vendors and take great care to ensure that they share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not, however, have any long-term term contracts with the majority of our suppliers or manufacturing sources for the production and supply of our fabrics and garments, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, and production. We require that all of our manufacturers adhere to our vendor code of ethics regarding social and environmental sustainability practices. Our product quality and sustainability teams partner with leading inspection and verification firms to closely monitor each supplier's compliance with applicable laws and our vendor code of ethics.\nDistribution Facilities\nWe operate and distribute finished products from our distribution facilities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. We own our distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, and lease our other distribution facilities. We also utilize third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from their warehouse locations in the United Sates, the PRC, and the Netherlands. We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and consolidate or expand our distribution capacity as we believe appropriate for our operations and to meet anticipated needs.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the athletic apparel industry is based principally on brand image and recognition as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution, and price. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of our premium brand image and our technical product innovation. We also believe our ability to introduce new product innovations, combine function and fashion, and connect through in-store, online, and community experiences sets us apart from our competition. In addition, we believe our vertical retail distribution strategy and community-based marketing differentiates us further, allowing us to more effectively control our brand image and connect with our guest.\nThe market for athletic apparel is highly competitive. It includes increasing competition from established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of performance products, as well as from frequent new entrants to the market. We are in direct competition with wholesalers and direct sellers of athletic apparel, such as Nike, Inc., adidas AG, Under Armour, Inc, and Columbia Sportswear Company. We also compete with retailers who have expanded to include women's athletic apparel including The Gap, Inc. (including the Athleta brand), Victoria's Secret with its sport and lounge offering, and Urban Outfitters, Inc.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. Our annual net revenue is weighted more heavily toward our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season, while our operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year. As a result, a substantial portion of our operating profits are generated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. For example, we generated approximately 44% and\n56% of our full year operating profit during the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Due to a significant number of our company-operated stores being temporarily closed due to COVID-19 during the first two quarters of 2020, we earned a higher proportion of our operating profit during the last two quarters of 2020 compared to 2021.\nHuman Capital\nOur Impact Agenda sets out our social and environmental goals, commitments, and strategy across three pillars - Be Well, Be Planet, and Be Human. Details of our Impact Agenda and corresponding Impact Report can be found on our website (https://corporate.lululemon.com/our-impact).\nThe Be Human pillar of our Impact Agenda sets out our focus areas with respect to our human capital, including our employees and broader community:\n\u2022advancing a culture of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action (\u201cIDEA\u201d);\n\u2022empowering our employees through whole-person opportunities; and\n\u2022supporting the well-being of the people who make our products in our supply chain.\nAdvancing a culture of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Action\nWe continually endeavor to create an environment that is equitable, inclusive, and fosters personal growth.\nDiversity and inclusion are key components of our culture and are fundamental to achieving our strategic priorities and future vision. The diversity of our teams and working in an inclusive culture enables increased employee engagement, better decision making, greater adaptability, creativity, and a deeper understanding of the communities we serve. We are proud that as of January 30, 2022, approximately 55% of our board of directors, 65% of our senior executive leadership team, and 50% of our vice presidents and above are women, while approximately 75% of our overall workforce are women.(1)\nWe maintain 100% gender pay equity within our entire global employee population, meaning equal pay for equal work across genders. We have achieved pay equity across all areas of diversity in the United States and are seeking, to the extent permitted under local law and regulation, to collect the data necessary to confirm complete pay equity globally.\nWe expect to invest at least $5 million annually to fund our global IDEA activities. These funds can further support the career progress of our diverse talent and increase access to internal opportunities and professional development. We offer all employees IDEA education, training, and guided conversations on a variety of topics, including anti-racism, anti-discrimination, and inclusive leadership behaviors. We aim to foster a culture of inclusion by making IDEA part of our everyday conversation, and frequently review our policies, programs, and practices to identify ways to be more inclusive and equitable.\nInclusive in our Impact Agenda is a goal to invest a total of $75.0 million to advance equity in well-being by 2025.\n(1) While we track male and female genders, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.\nEmpowering our employees through whole-person opportunities\nWe believe that each of our approximately 29,000 people are key to the success of our business. We strive to foster a distinctive culture rooted in our core values that attracts and retains passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals. We believe our people succeed because we create an environment that fosters growth and is diverse and equitable.\nWe assess our performance and identify opportunities for improvement through an annual employee engagement survey. In 2021, the participation rate was approximately 85% and our employee engagement score exceeded the retail industry average.(2) Our engagement score suggests our people are proud to work for lululemon, they are motivated to contribute to work that aligns with their purpose, and they recommend lululemon as a great place to work.\nWe understand that health and wealth programs need to offer choice at all stages of life. Our current offerings support our goal of becoming the number one place where people come to develop and grow as inclusive leaders. These offerings include, among other things:\n\u2022Competitive compensation which rewards exceptional performance;\n\u2022A parenthood program which is a gender-neutral benefit that provides all eligible employees up to six months of paid leave;\n\u2022An employee assistance program which provides free, confidential, support to all our employees and their families in a variety of areas from mental well-being to financial services to advice for new parents;\n\u2022Personal resilience tools to employees, ambassadors, and suppliers;\n\u2022Reimbursement programs which reward physical activity; and\n\u2022A Fund your Future program for eligible employees which offers partial contribution matches to a pension plan and employee share purchase plan.\nAs part of the competitive compensation we offer, we raised the minimum base pay for the majority of our store and Guest Education Center employees in North America during 2021.\nSupporting the well-being of the people who make our products in our supply chain\nWe work with suppliers who share our values and collaborate as partners to uphold robust standards, address systemic challenges, and improve the well-being of people who make our products.\nOur Vendor Code of Ethics outlines our commitment to respect human and labor rights, and to promote safe and fair working conditions for people in our supply chain. The code is based on international standards for workers' rights with regard to their employment, wages and working hours, occupational health and safety, access to confidential grievance mechanisms without retaliation, and environmental protection. Our finished goods and mill suppliers are assessed against the Vendor Code of Ethics prior to forming a business relationship, and regularly thereafter; we work with factories that can uphold our strict requirements.\n(2) Based on an industry benchmark provided by the third party that administers this survey to our employees.\nWe have developed and implemented our Foreign Migrant Worker Standard, which outlines our expectations with respect to foreign migrant workers. This program was successfully executed in Taiwan in 2020 and based on lessons learned from this program, we are now expanding beyond Taiwan so that we can further support foreign migrant workers globally.\nOur COVID-19 response\nWe closely monitor the changing landscape of COVID-19 so that we can make appropriate decisions to support and keep our people safe. Over the last two years, we have responded to the pandemic with a variety of measures from temporarily closing our stores to committing to pay protection for employees during the COVID-19 related closures. During 2020 we launched a hardship fund for employees, the We Stand Together Fund, and launched an Ambassador Relief Fund, and these continued in 2021.\nWe created a wide range of resiliency and connection sessions and tools to support our people during the pandemic and we made these resources available to our guests and the broader community.\nAs we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to prioritize the safety of our people and our guests. We are closely monitoring the situation in the markets and communities that we serve. We will temporarily close stores and restrict operations as necessary, based upon information from government and health officials.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have trademark rights on many of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in building our brand image and in distinguishing our products from the products of others. We consider our lululemon and wave design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. In addition, we own many other trademarks for names of several of our brands, slogans, fabrics and products. We own registered and pending U.S. and foreign utility and design patents, industrial designs in Canada, and registered community designs in Europe that protect our product innovations, distinctive apparel, and accessory designs.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Filings\nOur website address is www.lululemon.com. We provide free access to various reports that we file with, or furnish to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed or furnished. These reports include, but are not limited to, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports. Our SEC reports can also be accessed through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Also available on our website are printable versions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and charters of the standing committees of our board of directors. Information on our website does not constitute part of this annual report on Form 10-K or any other report we file or furnish with the SEC.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these risks.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand.\nThe lululemon name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our expansion strategies. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality product, and guest experience. We rely on social media, as one of our marketing strategies, to have a positive impact on both our brand value and reputation. Our brand and reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, if our public image was to be tarnished by negative publicity, which could be amplified by social media, if we fail to deliver innovative and high quality products acceptable to our guests, or if we face or mishandle a product recall. Our reputation could also be impacted by adverse publicity, whether or not valid, regarding allegations that we, or persons associated with us or formerly associated with us, have violated applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to those related to safety, employment, discrimination, harassment, whistle-blowing, privacy, corporate citizenship, improper business practices, or cybersecurity. Certain activities on the part of stakeholders, including nongovernmental organizations and governmental institutions, could cause reputational damage, distract senior management, and disrupt our business. Additionally, while we devote considerable effort and resources to protecting our\nintellectual property, if these efforts are not successful the value of our brand may be harmed. Any harm to our brand and reputation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and related government, private sector, and individual consumer responsive actions have and could continue to affect our business operations, store traffic, employee availability, supply chain, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. COVID-19 negatively impacted our business and operations in 2020. While conditions improved in 2021, the extent and duration of ongoing impacts remain uncertain.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused health officials to impose restrictions and recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as malls and lifestyle centers. Our stores have experienced temporary closures, and we have implemented precautionary measures in line with guidance from local authorities in the stores that are open. These measures include restrictions such as limitations on the number of guests allowed in our stores at any single time, minimum physical distancing requirements, and limited operating hours. We do not know how the measures recommended by local authorities or implemented by us may change over time or what the duration of these restrictions will be.\nFurther resurgences in COVID-19 cases, including from variants, could cause additional restrictions, including temporarily closing all or some of our stores again. An outbreak at one of our locations, even if we follow appropriate precautionary measures, could negatively impact our employees, guests, and brand. There is uncertainty over the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S., Canadian, and global economies, consumer willingness to visit stores, malls, and lifestyle centers, and employee willingness to staff our stores as the pandemic continues and if there are future resurgences. There is also uncertainty regarding potential long-term changes to consumer shopping behavior and preferences and whether consumer demand will recover when restrictions are lifted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed, or experience worker shortages. In particular, we have seen disruptions and delays in shipments, and we may see negative impacts to pricing of certain components of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 situation is changing rapidly and the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and its variants and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, including vaccinations.\nChanges in consumer shopping preferences, and shifts in distribution channels could materially impact our results of operations.\nWe sell our products through a variety of channels, with a significant portion through traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted guest shopping preferences away from brick-and-mortar and towards digital platforms. As strong e-commerce channels emerge and develop, we are evolving towards an omni-channel approach to support the shopping behavior of our guests. This involves country and region-specific websites, social media, product notification emails, mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, and online order fulfillment through stores. The diversion of sales from our company-operated stores could adversely impact our return on investment and could lead to impairment charges and store closures, including lease exit costs. We could have difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels. Our failure to successfully integrate our digital and physical channels and respond to these risks might adversely impact our business and results of operations, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nIf any of our products have manufacturing or design defects or are otherwise unacceptable to us or our guests, our business could be harmed.\nWe have occasionally received, and may in the future receive, shipments of products that fail to comply with our technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards. We have also received, and may in the future receive, products that are otherwise unacceptable to us or our guests. Under these circumstances, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenue resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. Additionally, if the unacceptability of our products is not discovered until after such products are sold, our guests could lose confidence in our products or we could face a product recall and our results of operations could suffer and our business, reputation, and brand could be harmed.\nOur MIRROR subsidiary offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by MIRROR, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products that we source from third parties. Any defects could make our products and services unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage or personal injury and we may become subject to the hazards and uncertainties of product liability claims and related litigation. The occurrence of real or perceived defects in any of our products, now or in the future, could result in additional negative publicity, regulatory investigations, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if guests or others who use or purchase our MIRROR products are injured. Even if injuries are not the result of any defects, if they are perceived to be, we may incur expenses to defend or settle any claims and our brand and reputation may be harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenue and profitability.\nThe market for technical athletic apparel is highly competitive. Competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins or lost market share, or a failure to grow or maintain our market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. We compete directly against wholesalers and direct retailers of athletic apparel, including large, diversified apparel companies with substantial market share, and established companies expanding their production and marketing of technical athletic apparel, as well as against retailers specifically focused on women's athletic apparel. We also face competition from wholesalers and direct retailers of traditional commodity athletic apparel, such as cotton T-shirts and sweatshirts. Many of our competitors are large apparel and sporting goods companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. Because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other apparel sellers, including those specializing in yoga apparel and other activewear. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, store development, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we do.\nOur competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can. In contrast to our grassroots community-based marketing approach, many of our competitors promote their brands through traditional forms of advertising, such as print media and television commercials, and through celebrity endorsements, and have substantial resources to devote to such efforts. Our competitors may also create and maintain brand awareness using traditional forms of advertising more quickly than we can. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales in their new and existing markets faster than we do by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do, such as catalog sales or an extensive franchise network.\nIn addition, because we hold limited patents and exclusive intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics or processes underlying our products, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, fabrication techniques, and styling similar to our products.\nOur sales and profitability may decline as a result of increasing costs and decreasing selling prices.\nOur business is subject to significant pressure on costs and pricing caused by many factors, including intense competition, constrained sourcing capacity and related inflationary pressure, the availability of qualified labor and wage inflation, pressure from consumers to reduce the prices we charge for our products, and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to experience increased costs, reduce our prices to consumers or experience reduced sales in response to increased prices, any of which could cause our operating margin to decline if we are unable to offset these factors with reductions in operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative, and differentiated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales and profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to introduce new products or novel technologies in a timely manner or our new products or technologies are not accepted by our guests, our competitors may introduce similar products in a more timely fashion, which could hurt our goal to be viewed as a leader in technical athletic apparel innovation. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of athletic apparel or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Our failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences,\nour ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. Our failure to effectively introduce new products that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenue and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast guest demand for our products.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in guest demand for our products or for products of our competitors, our failure to accurately forecast guest acceptance of new products, product introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions (for example, because of unexpected effects on inventory supply and consumer demand caused by the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic), and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions (for example, because of inflationary pressures, or because of sanctions, restrictions, and other responses related to geopolitical events). If we fail to accurately forecast guest demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale in our stores or for delivery to guests.\nInventory levels in excess of guest demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would cause our gross margin to suffer and could impair the strength and exclusivity of our brand. Conversely, if we underestimate guest demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our reputation and guest relationships.\nOur limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new international markets and new product categories may limit our expansion and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nOur future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of North America. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in any new market. In connection with our expansion efforts we may encounter obstacles we did not face in North America, including cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments, and international guests' tastes and preferences. We may also encounter difficulty expanding into new international markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our technical athletic apparel by guests in these new international markets. Our failure to develop our business in new international markets or disappointing growth outside of existing markets could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our product categories and introduce new product lines. We may not be able to successfully manage integration of new product categories or the new product lines with our existing products. Selling new product categories and lines will require our management to learn different strategies in order to be successful. We may be unsuccessful in entering new product categories and developing or launching new product lines, which requires management of new suppliers, potential new customers, and new business models. Our management may not have the experience of selling in these new product categories and we may not be able to grow our business as planned. For example, in July 2020, we acquired MIRROR, an in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform that features live and on-demand classes. If we are unable to effectively and successfully further develop these and future new product categories and lines, we may not be able to increase or maintain our sales and our operating margins may be adversely affected.\nWe may not realize the potential benefits and synergies sought with the acquisition of MIRROR.\nDuring 2020, we acquired MIRROR as part of our growth plan, which includes driving business through omni-guest experiences. The potential benefits of enhancing our digital and interactive capabilities and deepening our roots in the sweatlife might not be realized fully, if at all, or take longer than anticipated to achieve. Further, the expected synergies between lululemon and MIRROR, such as those related to our connections with our guests and communities as well as our store and direct to consumer infrastructure, may not materialize. A significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and if our acquisition does not yield expected returns, we may be required to record impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur management team has limited experience in addressing the challenges of integrating management teams, strategies, cultures, and organizations of two companies. This integration may divert the attention of management and cause additional expenses. Management also has limited experience outside of the retail industry, including with the specialized hardware and software sold and licensed by MIRROR. If MIRROR has inadequate or ineffective controls and procedures, our\ninternal control over financial reporting could be adversely impacted. The acquisition may not be well received by the customers or employees of either company, and this could hurt our brand and result in the loss of key employees. If we are unable to successfully integrate MIRROR, including its people and technologies, or if integration takes longer than planned, we may not be able to manage operations efficiently, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The acquisition of MIRROR may also divert management time and other resources away from our existing business.\nIn addition, we may, from time to time, evaluate and pursue other strategic investments or acquisitions. These involve various inherent risks and the benefits sought may not be realized. The acquisition of MIRROR or other strategic investments or acquisitions may not create value and may harm our brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to grow the MIRROR business and have it achieve profitability.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain subscribers to MIRROR. If we do not provide the delivery and installation service that our guests expect, offer engaging and innovative classes, and support and continue to improve the technology used, we may not be able to maintain and grow the number of subscribers. This could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on technology systems to provide live and recorded classes to our customers with MIRROR subscriptions, to maintain its software, and to manage subscriptions. If we experience issues such as cybersecurity threats or actions, or interruptions or delays in our technology systems, the data privacy and overall experience of subscribers could be negatively impacted and could therefore damage our brand and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCompetition, including from other in-home fitness providers as well as in-person fitness studios, and trends of consumer preferences, could also impact the level of subscriptions and therefore our results of operations.\nIf we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of our business and as a result our brand image and financial performance may suffer.\nWe have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception in 1998 and our net revenue has increased from $40.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $6.3 billion in 2021. If our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. We could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space for our expanding workforce. This expansion could increase the strain on our resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training, and managing an increasing number of employees. These difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail and distribution space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases.\nWe lease the majority of our stores under operating leases and our inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact our ability to grow. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can be extended in five-year increments if at all. We generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. If an existing or new store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, as we have done in the past and may do in the future, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Similarly, we may be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable leases even if current locations of our stores become unattractive as demographic patterns change. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could require us to close stores in desirable locations.\nWe also lease the majority of our distribution centers and our inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact our ability to deliver our products to the market.\nWe may not be able to successfully open new store locations in a timely manner, if at all, which could harm our results of operations.\nOur growth will largely depend on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores. We may be unsuccessful in identifying new locations and markets where our technical athletic apparel and other products and brand image will be accepted. In addition, we may not be able to open or profitably operate new stores in existing, adjacent, or new markets due to the impact of COVID-19, political instability, inflationary pressures, or other economic conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the service of our senior management and other key employees.\nIn the last few years, we have had changes to our senior management team including new hires, departures, and role and responsibility changes. The performance of our senior management team and other key employees may not meet our needs and expectations. Also, the loss of services of any of these key employees, or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and could have a negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. Such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance, financial condition, and the market price of our stock.\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nOur business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. Our annual net revenue is weighted more heavily toward our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season, while our operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including weather conditions and the effects of climate change, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\nRisks related to our supply chain\nDisruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nDisruption of our supply chain capabilities due to trade restrictions, political instability, severe weather, natural disasters, public health crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, war, terrorism, product recalls, labor supply or stoppages, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, changes in diplomatic or trade relationships (including any sanctions, restrictions, and other responses such as those related to current geopolitical events), or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute our products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nOur reliance on suppliers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products could cause problems if we experience a supply chain disruption and we are unable to secure additional suppliers of fabrics or other raw materials, or manufacturers of our end products.\nThe entire apparel industry, including our company, continues to face supply chain challenges as a result of economic uncertainty due to the impacts of COVID-19, political instability, inflationary pressures, and other factors, including reduced freight availability and increased costs, port disruption, manufacturing facility closures, and related labor shortages and other supply chain disruptions. We do not manufacture our products or the raw materials for them and rely instead on suppliers. Many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed and manufactured by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from only one or a limited number of sources. We have no long-term contracts with any of our suppliers or manufacturers for the production and supply of our raw materials and products, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, other raw materials, and production. The following statistics are based on cost.\nWe work with a group of approximately 41 vendors that manufacture our products, five of which produced 57% of our products in 2021. During 2021, the largest single manufacturer produced approximately 15% of our products. During 2021, approximately 40% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 17% in Cambodia, 11% in Sri Lanka, 7% in the PRC, including 2% in Taiwan, and the remainder in other regions.\nWe work with a group of approximately 65 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. In 2021, 56% of our fabrics were produced by our top five fabric suppliers, and the largest single manufacturer produced approximately 27% of fabric used. During 2021, approximately 48% of our fabrics originated from Taiwan, 19% from Mainland China, 11% from Sri Lanka, and the remainder from other regions.\nWe also source other raw materials which are used in our products, including items such as content labels, elastics, buttons, clasps, and drawcords from suppliers located predominantly in the Asia Pacific region.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials and may be unable to locate alternative suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, if we experience significant increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier or manufacturer, we may be unable to locate additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate any supplier or manufacturer with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with its quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, and quality control standards.\nOur supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could be disrupted or delayed by the impact of health pandemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, and the related government and private sector responsive actions such as border closures, restrictions on product shipments, and travel restrictions, as well as other economic or political conditions. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from our markets or from other participants in our supply chain. The receipt of inventory sourced from areas impacted by COVID-19 has been slowed or disrupted and our manufacturers may also face similar challenges in receiving fabric and fulfilling our orders. In addition, ocean freight capacity issues continue to persist worldwide as there is much greater demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet guest demand for our products and result in lower net revenue and income from operations both in the short and long term.\nOur business could be harmed if our suppliers and manufacturers do not comply with our Vendor Code of Ethics or applicable laws.\nWhile we require our suppliers and manufacturers to comply with our Vendor Code of Ethics, which includes labor, health and safety, and environment standards, we do not control their operations. If suppliers or contractors do not comply with these standards or applicable laws or there is negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers or manufacturers, even if unfounded or not specific to our supply chain, our reputation and sales could be adversely affected, we could be subject to legal liability, or could cause us to contract with alternative suppliers or manufacturing sources.\nThe fluctuating cost of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold.\nThe fabrics used to make our products include synthetic fabrics whose raw materials include petroleum-based products. Our products also include silver and natural fibers, including cotton. Our costs for raw materials are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries, and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. Any and all of these factors may be exacerbated by global climate change. In addition, ongoing impacts of the pandemic, political instability, trade relations, sanctions, price inflationary pressure, or other geopolitical or economic conditions could cause raw material costs to increase and have an adverse effect on our future margins. Increases in the cost of raw materials, including petroleum or the prices we pay for silver and our cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles, could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIf we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market and to meet guest expectations could be harmed.\nWe rely on our distribution facilities for substantially all of our product distribution. Our distribution facilities include computer controlled and automated equipment, which means their operations may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions, or other system failures. In addition, our operations could also be interrupted by labor difficulties, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), the impacts of climate change, extreme or severe weather conditions or by floods, fires, or other natural disasters near our distribution centers. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet guest expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be harmed.\nIncreasing labor costs and other factors associated with the production of our products in South Asia and South East Asia could increase the costs to produce our products.\nA significant portion of our products are produced in South Asia and South East Asia and increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in the countries in this area could significantly increase our costs to produce our products and could have a negative impact on our operations and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business include labor shortages and increases in labor costs, labor disputes, pandemics, the impacts of climate change, difficulties and\nadditional costs in transporting products manufactured from these countries to our distribution centers and significant revaluation of the currencies used in these countries, which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products. Also, the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations against products imported by us from, or the loss of \"normal trade relations\" status with any country in which our products are manufactured, could significantly increase our cost of products and harm our business.\nRisks related to information security and technology\nWe may be unable to safeguard against security breaches which could damage our customer relationships and result in significant legal and financial exposure.\nAs part of our normal operations, we receive confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of theft or misuse of this information, and could result in litigation and potential liability.\nThe retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to be able to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, despite taking measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, our customers and our business could still be exposed to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber-attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers' shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use.\nData and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues including intentional or inadvertent breach by employees or persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business.\nIn addition, the increased use of employee-owned devices for communications as well as work-from-home arrangements, such as those implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, present additional operational risks to our technology systems, including increased risks of cyber-attacks. Further, like other companies in the retail industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but they may have an impact in the future.\nPrivacy and data protection laws increase our compliance burden.\nWe are subject to a variety of privacy and data protection laws and regulations that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, we are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the General Data Privacy Regulation (\"GDPR\") in the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d) in Canada, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), and the Personal Information Protection Law (\u201cPIPL\u201d) in the PRC. Some privacy laws prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions. We are subject to privacy and data protection audits or investigations by various government agencies. Our failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, and other costs. Our efforts to comply with privacy laws may complicate our operations and add to our compliance costs. A significant privacy breach or failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with privacy or data protection laws, regulations, policies or regulatory guidance might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, business operations and our financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruption of our technology systems or unexpected network interruption could disrupt our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent on technology systems and third-parties to operate our e-commerce websites, process transactions, respond to guest inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis, and maintain cost-efficient operations. The failure of our technology systems to operate properly or effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or difficulty in integrating new systems, could adversely affect our business. In addition, we have e-commerce websites in the United States, Canada, and internationally. Our technology systems, websites, and\noperations of third parties on whom we rely, may encounter damage or disruption or slowdown caused by a failure to successfully upgrade systems, system failures, viruses, computer \"hackers\", natural disasters, or other causes. These could cause information, including data related to guest orders, to be lost or delayed which could, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during the holiday season, result in delays in the delivery of products to our stores and guests or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our products and cause our sales to decline. The concentration of our primary offices, two of our distribution centers, and a number of our stores along the west coast of North America could amplify the impact of a natural disaster occurring in that area to our business, including to our technology systems. In addition, if changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose guests. We have limited back-up systems and redundancies, and our technology systems and websites have experienced system failures and electrical outages in the past which have disrupted our operations. Any significant disruption in our technology systems or websites could harm our reputation and credibility, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online may not function effectively.\nMany of our customers shop with us through our e-commerce websites and mobile apps. Increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile apps to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisks related to environmental, social, and governance issues\nClimate change, and related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, may adversely impact our business.\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual rise in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, an increase in the frequency, severity, and duration of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and water scarcity and poor water quality. These events could adversely impact the cultivation of cotton, which is a key resource in the production of our products, disrupt the operation of our supply chain and the productivity of our contract manufacturers, increase our production costs, impose capacity restraints and impact the types of apparel products that consumers purchase. These events could also compound adverse economic conditions and impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In many countries, governmental bodies are enacting new or additional legislation and regulations to reduce or mitigate the potential impacts of climate change. If we, our suppliers, or our contract manufacturers are required to comply with these laws and regulations, or if we choose to take voluntary steps to reduce or mitigate our impact on climate change, we may experience increased costs for energy, production, transportation, and raw materials, increased capital expenditures, or increased insurance premiums and deductibles, which could adversely impact our operations. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations among jurisdictions may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries in which we operate.\nIncreased scrutiny from investors and others regarding our environmental, social, governance, or sustainability, responsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation, employee retention, and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nInvestor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, stockholders, and customers have focused increasingly on the environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") or \u201csustainability\u201d practices of companies, including those associated with climate change. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted based on an assessment of our ESG practices. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosures we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any\nsustainability disclosure could negatively impact our reputation, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nRisks related to global economic, political, and regulatory conditions\nAn economic recession, depression, downturn, periods of inflation, or economic uncertainty in our key markets may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products.\nMany of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending on discretionary items include general economic conditions, high levels of unemployment, health pandemics (such as the impact of the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, including reduced store traffic and widespread temporary closures of retail locations), higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency exchange rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, inflationary pressure, tax rates and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Global economic conditions are uncertain and volatile, due in part to the impacts of COVID-19 and related restrictions and mitigation measures, the potential impacts of increasing inflation in the United States (our largest market), the potential impacts of geopolitical uncertainties, and any potential sanctions, restrictions or responses to those conditions. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products. Consumer demand for our products may not reach our targets, or may decline, when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nGlobal economic and political conditions and global events such as health pandemics could adversely impact our results of operations.\nUncertain or challenging global economic and political conditions could impact our performance, including our ability to successfully expand internationally. Global economic conditions could impact levels of consumer spending in the markets in which we operate, which could impact our sales and profitability. Political unrest, such as the turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions, or other responses, could negatively impact our guests and employees, reduce consumer spending, and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Health pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and the related governmental, private sector and individual consumer responses could contribute to a recession, depression, or global economic downturn, reduce store traffic and consumer spending, result in temporary or permanent closures of retail locations, offices, and factories, and could negatively impact the flow of goods.\nWe may be unable to source and sell our merchandise profitably or at all if new trade restrictions are imposed or existing restrictions become more burdensome.\nThe United States and the countries in which our products are produced or sold have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty, or tariff levels. The results of any audits or related disputes regarding these restrictions or regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. Countries impose, modify, and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions. Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us, could increase shipping times, or may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on international trade agreements and regulations. The countries in which we produce and sell our products could impose or increase tariffs, duties, or other similar charges that could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAdverse changes in, or withdrawal from, trade agreements or political relationships between the United States and the PRC, Canada, or other countries where we sell or source our products, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows. Any tariffs imposed between the United States and the PRC could increase the costs of our products. General geopolitical instability and the responses to it, such as the possibility of sanctions, trade restrictions, and changes in tariffs, including recent sanctions against the PRC, tariffs imposed by the United States and the PRC, and the possibility of additional\ntariffs or other trade restrictions between the United States and Mexico, could adversely impact our business. It is possible that further tariffs may be introduced, or increased. Such changes could adversely impact our business and could increase the costs of sourcing our products from the PRC, or could require us to source more of our products from other countries.\nThere could be changes in economic conditions in the United Kingdom (\"UK\") or European Union (\"EU\"), including due to the UK's withdrawal from the EU, foreign currency exchange rates, and consumer markets. Our business could be adversely affected by these changes, including by additional duties on the importation of our products into the UK from the EU and as a result of shipping delays or congestion.\nChanges in tax laws or unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, Canada, and several other international jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rates could be unfavorably impacted by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings amongst countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, new tax interpretations and guidance, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of unremitted earnings for which we have not previously accrued applicable U.S. income taxes and international withholding taxes.\nRepatriations from our Canadian subsidiaries are not subject to Canadian withholding taxes if such distributions are made as a return of capital. We have not accrued for any Canadian withholding taxes that could be payable on future repatriations from our Canadian subsidiaries because we believe the current net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries is expected to be indefinitely reinvested, or can be repatriated free of withholding tax. The extent to which future increases in the net assets of our Canadian subsidiaries can be repatriated free of withholding tax is dependent on, among other things, the amount of paid-up-capital in our Canadian subsidiaries and transactions undertaken by our exchangeable shareholders. As of January 30, 2022, we had 5.2 million exchangeable shares outstanding. If there are insufficient transactions by our exchangeable shareholders between now and the end of fiscal 2022, and our Canadian subsidiary continues to generate profits at historic rates, then it is likely that we will be unable to repatriate all of our fiscal 2022 Canadian earnings free of withholding tax. We would therefore accrue for Canadian withholding taxes, and our effective tax rate would increase as a result.\nWe and our subsidiaries engage in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect the accurate economic allocation of profit and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, the profit allocation and transfer pricing terms and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities during an audit and any resulting changes may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. At the end of 2020, our Advance Pricing Arrangement (\"APA\") with the Internal Revenue Service and the Canada Revenue Agency expired. This APA stipulated the allocation of certain profits between the U.S. and Canada. We are currently in the process of negotiating the renewal of this arrangement and the final agreed upon terms and conditions thereof could impact our effective tax rate.\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States and Canada, subject to significant change. Changes in applicable U.S., Canadian, or other international tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our income tax expense and profitability, as they did in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 upon passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and in 2020 with the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.\nOur failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity.\nThe labeling, distribution, importation, marketing, and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission and state attorneys general in the United States, the Competition Bureau and Health Canada in Canada, the State Administration for Market Regulation of the PRC, General Administration of Customs of the PRC, as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local, and international regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are distributed or sold. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could become subject to enforcement actions or the imposition of significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. In addition, any audits and inspections by governmental agencies related to these matters could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, fines, or other penalties, divert financial and management resources, and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and could impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenue.\nOur international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. In many countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other U.S. and international laws and regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented procedures designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, some of our employees, agents, or other partners, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, could take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nBecause a significant portion of our net revenue and expenses are generated in countries other than the United States, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have affected our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign currency exchange differences which arise on translation of our international subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.\nWe also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.\nAlthough we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements.\nWe are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to forward currency contracts used in our hedging strategies.\nRisks related to intellectual property\nOur fabrics and manufacturing technology generally are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. If our competitors sell products similar to ours at lower prices, our net revenue and profitability could suffer.\nThe intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics, and processes used to manufacture our products generally are owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. Our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is therefore limited. We hold limited patents and exclusive intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics or processes underlying our products. As a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, fabrics and styling similar to our products. Because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. If our competitors sell products similar to ours at lower prices, our net revenue and profitability could suffer.\nOur failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.\nWe currently rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of these rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. In addition, any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, which could result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or unenforceable, or our intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some international countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States or Canada, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our intellectual property rights by other parties in these countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished, and our competitive position may suffer.\nOur trademarks, patents, and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products.\nOur success depends in large part on our brand image. We believe that our trademarks, patents, and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. We have applied for and obtained some United States, Canada, and international trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to evaluate additional trademarks and patents as appropriate. However, some or all of these pending trademark or patent applications may not be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these applications or registrations. Additionally, we may face obstacles as we expand our product line and the geographic scope of our sales and marketing. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. Our defense of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management resources. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights from third parties, or cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events could harm our business and cause our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition to suffer.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our market, and litigation, based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property, is frequent in the fitness and technology industries. Furthermore, it is common for individuals and groups to purchase patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies like ours. Our use of third-party content, including music content, software, and other intellectual property rights may be subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation. We cannot guarantee that our internally developed or acquired technologies and content do not or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our platform or services or using certain technologies, force us to implement expensive work-arounds, or impose other unfavorable terms. We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the market for fitness products and services grows and as we introduce new and updated products and offerings. Accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from competing effectively and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks related to legal and governance matters\nWe are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to product liability claims, stockholder class action and derivative claims, commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory, employment, and other claims related to our business. Any of these proceedings could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, fines, or other penalties, divert financial and management resources, and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could exceed the limits of our insurance policies or the carriers may decline to fund such final settlements and/or judgments and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our guests and our brand image.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders or others.\nWe may be subject to actions or proposals from stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. Responding to such actions can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, and divert the attention of our board of directors, management, and employees from the pursuit of our business strategies. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan. Activist stockholders or others may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and potential guests, and may affect our relationships with current guests, vendors, investors, and other third parties. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our board of directors. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay and discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider to be favorable.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult or impossible for a third-party to acquire control of us or effect a change in our board of directors and management. These provisions include:\n\u2022the classification of our board of directors into three classes, with one class elected each year;\n\u2022prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022the ability to remove a director only for cause and only with the vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock;\n\u2022a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our chairman or Chief Executive Officer, or upon a resolution adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors, and not by our stockholders;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022our stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to place stockholder proposals on the agenda for consideration at any meeting of our stockholders.\nIn addition, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to some specified exceptions, prohibits \"business combinations\" between a Delaware corporation and an \"interested stockholder,\" which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation's voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Components of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include:\n\u2022Overview - The Power of Three\n\u2022Financial Highlights\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Comparison of 2021 to 2020\n\u2022Comparable Store Sales and Total Comparable Sales\n\u2022Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Liquidity Outlook\n\u2022Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2021 and 2020 were each 52-week years.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions included in the \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in the \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations website (http://investor.lululemon.com/), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.\nOverview - The Power of Three\nIn 2021, we continued to execute against our Power of Three growth plan. We have achieved some of our key growth goals under this plan two years ahead of schedule. These include generating $6 billion in net revenue, doubling our men's net revenue relative to fiscal 2018, and doubling our e-commerce net revenue relative to fiscal 2018 (which we achieved in 2020). We have seen the trends that we believe have fueled our business over the last few years continue. These include the desire to live an active and healthy lifestyle, the desire to be part of a diverse and inclusive community, and the desire to achieve wellness, both physically and mentally.\nWe achieved these goals while strategically managing a number of challenges related to the COVID-19 environment, including stores closures, capacity constraints, and challenges across our supply chain including certain supplier factory closures, port slowdowns, and reduced air freight capacity.\nProduct Innovation\nOur lens for product development and innovation continues to be what we refer to as the Science of Feel. In 2021, we continued to bring technical innovations to our guests including expanding our Yoga offering with the launch of our Instill franchise, made from our SmoothCover fabric; we continued to build out our high support bra offerings with the launch of the Air Support bra, our most tested bra to date, which took five years to research and develop and is made from our Ultralu fabric; and for men we launched the versatile License to Train short, made from our High Impact Swift Pique fabric and further built out our On The Move offering with the Bowline bottom. We are also particularly proud of our multi-year collaboration with the Canadian Olympic Committee and Paralympic Committee. This collaboration allows us to showcase the lululemon brand and our technical expertise within apparel on the world stage; and we believe it is a compelling platform that we can leverage to continue to grow our brand presence both inside and outside of Canada.\nOmni Guest Experience\nWe continue to see benefits from our omni business model and in 2021, net revenue in our company-operated store channel increased 70% and our e-commerce business increased 22%. We engaged with our guests both in real life (where and when it was safe to do so) and virtually. In our digital business, we continued to see the benefits of the investments we have made over the last several years, while we continue to invest in our websites and mobile apps as we work to elevate the guest\nexperience. In 2021, we continued to make foundational investments which included expanding our accepted payment methods, improving our storytelling, making search more predictive, and making the checkout process more seamless. When looking at MIRROR, we continue to focus on strategies and initiatives which we believe will allow us to build our community and increase guest loyalty. These include setting up MIRROR shop-in-shops in approximately 200 stores in North America, including launching in Canada, and continuing to enhance the offering with new classes and connected accessories.\nMarket Expansion\nWe continued to expand our presence both in North America and in our international markets. During 2021, we opened 53 net new company-operated stores, including 31 stores in the PRC, seven stores in the rest of Asia Pacific, 10 stores in North America, and five stores in Europe.\nIn 2021, our net revenue in North America increased 40%. In our international markets, we saw revenue growth of 53%, which keeps us on track with our goal to quadruple the business from 2018 levels by 2023.\nCOVID-19 Update\nCOVID-19 continues to impact the global economy and cause disruption and volatility. While most of our retail locations were open throughout 2021, certain locations were temporarily closed based on government and health authority guidance. We believe we will continue to experience differing levels of disruption and volatility, market by market. The pandemic has also impacted our product manufacturers and our distribution and logistics providers. There has been disruption in transportation and port congestion, an increase in freight costs, and we have increased our use of air freight. We expect this disruption and increased costs to continue throughout fiscal 2022.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe summary below compares 2021 to 2020:\n\u2022Net revenue increased 42% to $6.3 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net revenue increased 40%.\n\u2022Company-operated stores net revenue increased 70% to $2.8 billion.\n\u2022Direct to consumer net revenue increased 22% to $2.8 billion, or increased 20% on a constant dollar basis.\n\u2022Gross profit increased 46% to $3.6 billion.\n\u2022Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 57.7%.\n\u2022Acquisition-related expenses of $41.4 million were recognized in 2021 compared to $29.8 million in 2020.\n\u2022Income from operations increased 63% to $1.3 billion.\n\u2022Operating margin increased 270 basis points to 21.3%.\n\u2022Income tax expense increased 56% to $358.5 million. Our effective tax rate for 2021 was 26.9% compared to 28.1% for 2020.\n\u2022Diluted earnings per share were $7.49 for 2021 compared to $4.50 in 2020. This includes $40.0 million and $26.7 million of after-tax costs related to the MIRROR acquisition in 2021 and 2020, respectively, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.30 and $0.20 in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRefer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for reconciliations between constant dollar changes in net revenue and direct to consumer net revenue, and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nComparison of 2021 to 2020\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue increased $1.9 billion, or 42%, to $6.3 billion in 2021 from $4.4 billion in 2020. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average foreign currency exchange rates in 2021 remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates in 2020, net revenue increased $1.8 billion, or 40%.\nThe increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased company-operated store net revenue, which was the result of more extensive temporary store closures and COVID-19 operating restrictions that were in place during 2020. Direct to consumer net revenue and other net revenue also increased.\nNet revenue for 2021 and 2020 is summarized below.\nCompany-Operated Stores. The increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment was primarily due to most of our stores being open throughout 2021, while almost all were temporarily closed for a significant portion of the first two quarters of 2020, and open with reduced operating hours and occupancy restrictions for the last two quarters of 2020 as a result of COVID-19.\nDuring 2021, we opened 53 net new company-operated stores, including 38 stores in Asia Pacific, 10 stores in North America, and five stores in Europe.\nDirect to Consumer. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 22%, and increased 20% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic and higher dollar value per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in conversion rates. During the second quarter of 2020, we held an online warehouse sale in the United States and Canada which generated net revenue of $43.3 million. We did not hold any warehouse sales during 2021.\nOther. The increase in other net revenue was primarily due to most of our outlet and pop up locations being open throughout 2021, while almost all were temporarily closed for a significant portion of the first two quarters of 2020, and open with reduced operating hours and occupancy restrictions for the last two quarters of 2020 as a result of COVID-19. The increase in net revenue from our other retail locations was partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from MIRROR.\nGross Profit\nThe increase in gross margin was primarily the result of:\n\u2022a decrease in occupancy and depreciation costs as a percentage of net revenue of 130 basis points, driven primarily by the increase in net revenue;\n\u2022a decrease in costs related to our distribution centers and product departments as a percentage of net revenue of 30 basis points, driven primarily by the increase in net revenue; and\n\u2022a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 30 basis points.\nThe increase in gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in product margin of 20 basis points, primarily due to higher air freight costs as a result of global supply chain disruption, partially offset by lower markdowns.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:\n\u2022an increase in costs related to our operating channels of $286.4 million, comprised of:\n-an increase in employee costs of $150.8 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages expense and incentive compensation expenses in our company-operated store and other retail locations, primarily due to the increased number of hours worked as a result of COVID-19 impacts in 2020, and increased wage rates in 2021, as well as performance and growth in our business;\n-an increase in variable costs of $78.1 million primarily due to an increase in distribution costs related to the growth in our direct to consumer net revenue, and an increase in credit card fees as a result of increased net revenue;\n-an increase in brand and community costs of $37.6 million primarily due to an increase in digital marketing expenses; and\n-an increase in other costs of $19.9 million primarily due to an increase in depreciation, professional fees, and technology costs;\n\u2022an increase in head office costs of $287.7 million, comprised of:\n-an increase of $163.9 million primarily due to increases in professional fees, brand and community costs, technology costs, and other head office costs; and\n-an increase in employee costs of $123.8 million primarily due to increased salaries and wages expense, and incentive compensation, stock-based compensation expense, and employee benefit costs;\n\u2022a decrease in government payroll subsidies of $36.5 million as no government payroll subsidies were recognized in 2021; and\n\u2022an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative revaluation losses of $5.3 million.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe increase in the amortization of intangible assets was the result of the intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of MIRROR during the second quarter of 2020.\nAcquisition-Related Expenses\nIn connection with our acquisition of MIRROR, we recognized acquisition-related compensation expenses of $38.4 million and $20.1 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We also recognized transaction and integration related costs of $3.0 million and $10.5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Acquisition-related expenses in 2020 were partially offset by a $0.8 million gain that was recognized on our existing investment.\nPlease refer to Note 6. Acquisition included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for information on the nature and recognition of acquisition-related compensation expense.\nIncome from Operations\nOn a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses.\nSegmented income from operations before general corporate expenses is summarized below.\nCompany-Operated Stores. The increase in income from operations from company-operated stores was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $712.8 million, driven by increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to leverage on fixed costs. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to higher employee and operating costs. Employee costs increased primarily due to the increased number of hours worked as a result of COVID-19 impacts in 2020, as well as increased wage rates in 2021, and performance and growth in our business. Store operating costs increased, primarily due to increases in credit card fees, packaging costs and distribution costs as a result of higher net revenue, and due to government payroll subsidies during 2020 that partially offset selling, general and administrative expenses. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased, primarily due to higher gross margin and leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.\nDirect to Consumer. The increase in income from operations from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $311.2 million, driven by increased net revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin. The\ndecrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased air freight and distribution center costs relative to net revenue. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher variable costs including distribution costs and credit card fees as a result of higher net revenue, as well as higher digital marketing expenses, depreciation, employee costs and technology costs. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin and deleverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOther. The increase in income from operations was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $120.6 million, driven by increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher product margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, driven by higher overall salaries and wages expense, incentive compensation, MIRROR marketing expenses and professional fees. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased primarily due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and a higher gross margin.\nGeneral Corporate Expenses. The increase in general corporate expenses was primarily the result of increases in employee costs primarily from the growth in our business, as well as increased professional fees, brand and community costs, technology costs, and supplies. An increase in net foreign exchange and derivative losses of $5.3 million also contributed to the increase in general corporate expense. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our operations.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe increase in other income, net was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to our credit facilities, including for the 364-day credit facility that was in place during 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in interest income primarily due to lower interest rates. We did not have any borrowings on our revolving credit facilities during 2021 or 2020.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a net increase in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation, and adjustments upon filing of certain income tax returns, partially offset by non-deductible expenses in international jurisdictions. Certain non-deductible expenses related to the MIRROR acquisition increased the effective tax rate by 70 basis points in 2021 compared to 60 basis points in 2020.\nNet Income\nThe increase in net income in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $1.1 billion, an increase in other income (expense), net of $1.2 million partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $616.0 million, an increase in income tax expense of $128.1 million, an increase in acquisition-related expenses of $11.6 million, and an increase in amortization of intangible assets of $3.6 million.\nComparable Store Sales and Total Comparable Sales\nWe use comparable store sales to assess the performance of our existing stores as it allows us to monitor the performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or expanded stores. We use total comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our business from an omni-channel perspective. We believe investors would similarly find these metrics useful in assessing the performance of our business. However, as the temporary store closures from COVID-19\nresulted in a significant number of stores being removed from our comparable store calculations during the first two quarters of 2020, we believe total comparable sales and comparable store sales on a full year basis are not currently representative of the underlying trends of our business. We do not believe these full year metrics are currently useful to investors in understanding performance, therefore we have not included these metrics in our discussion and analysis of results of operations. We did not provide comparable sales metrics that included the first two quarters during 2020 or 2021.\nComparable store sales reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open, or open after being significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months, and from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations or temporarily closed. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer and our other operations, as well as sales from company-operated stores that have closed.\nTotal comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer net revenue.\nIn fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of comparable sales. In the year following a 53 week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks.\nOpening new stores and expanding existing stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales is just one way of assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores opened, or significantly expanded, within the last 12 full fiscal months. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant dollar changes in net revenue and direct to consumer net revenue are non-GAAP financial measures.\nA constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in our results to help investors understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\nThe below changes in net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and capacity under our committed revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, investing in technology and making system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions, as well as in money market funds and term deposits.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated:\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily as a result of:\n\u2022increased net income of $386.4 million;\n\u2022an increase in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $176.7 million. This increase was driven by changes in income taxes, accrued compensation, and accounts payable, partially offset by cash flows related to inventories; and\n\u2022changes in adjusting items of $22.7 million primarily related to an increase in depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and higher cash inflows related to derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship, partially offset by changes in deferred income taxes.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of MIRROR, net of cash acquired for $452.6 million during 2020. This was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $189.6 million and $134.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, for opening new company-operated stores, and ongoing store refurbishment. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment also included $47.1 million to open 56 company-operated stores and $41.0 million to open 40 company-operated stores, in 2021 and 2020 respectively. We expect to open approximately 70 new company-operated stores in 2022.\nCapital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $81.7 million and $37.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The capital expenditures in 2021 were primarily related to our distribution centers as well as other technology infrastructure and system initiatives.\nCapital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $123.2 million and $57.8 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The capital expenditures in each fiscal year were primarily related to investments in technology and business systems, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores. The increase in capital expenditures for our corporate activities and other was partially due to more larger scale projects, this was partially offset by a continued shift to cloud computing in 2021. Implementation costs related to cloud service arrangements are recognized within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and the associated cash flows are included in operating activities.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in our stock repurchases. During 2021, 2.2 million shares were repurchased at a cost of $812.6 million. During 2020, 0.4 million shares were repurchased at a cost of $63.7 million. The other common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.\nLiquidity Outlook\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand\nfor our products as well as the other factors described in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.\nThe following table includes certain measures of our liquidity:\n__________\n(1)Working capital is calculated as current assets of $2.6 billion less current liabilities of $1.4 billion.\nCapital expenditures are expected to range between $600.0 million and $625.0 million in fiscal 2022.\nOur current commitments with respect to inventory purchases are included within our purchase obligations outlined below. The timing and cost of our inventory purchases will vary depending on a variety of factors such as revenue growth, assortment and purchasing decisions, product costs including freight and duty, and the availability of production capacity and speed. Our inventory balance as at January 30, 2022 was $966.5 million, an increase of 49% from January 31, 2021. Increased air freight usage and cost has contributed to the increase in inventory. On a number of units basis, our inventory increased 33% compared to January 31, 2021. We expect that our inventory balance will continue to grow in fiscal 2022 and we expect the growth rate will exceed net revenue growth in fiscal 2022.\nOur existing North America credit facility provides for $400.0 million in commitments under an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. The credit facility has a maturity date of December 14, 2026, subject to extension under certain circumstances. As of January 30, 2022, aside from letters of credit of $3.0 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Further information regarding our credit facilities and associated covenants is outlined in Note 11. Revolving Credit Facilities included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can be extended in five-year increments, if at all. The following table details our future minimum lease payments. Minimum lease commitments exclude variable lease expenses including contingent rent payments, common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's insurance.\nPurchase obligations. The amounts listed for purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products and for other expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, values are subject to change, such as for product purchases throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets as of January 30, 2022.\nOne-time transition tax payable. The U.S. tax reforms enacted in December 2017 imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The one-time transition tax payable is net of foreign tax credits, and the table below outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.\nDeferred consideration. The amounts listed for deferred consideration in the table below represent expected future cash payments for certain continuing MIRROR employees, subject to the continued employment of those individuals up to three years from the acquisition date as outlined in Note 6. Acquisition included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements due by fiscal year as of January 30, 2022, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nAs of January 30, 2022, our operating lease commitments for distribution center operating leases which have been signed, but not yet commenced, was $379.7 million, which is not reflected in the table above.\nWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of January 30, 2022, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $4.4 million had been issued, including $3.0 million under our committed revolving credit facility.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of significant judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nOur critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgements are as follows, and see Note 2. Summary of Significant Account Policies included in Item 8 of Part II for additional information:\nInventory provisions\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make a provision for obsolescence and goods that have quality issues or that are damaged. We record a provision at an amount that is equal to the difference between the inventory cost and its net realizable value. As of January 30, 2022 the net carrying value of our inventories was $966.5 million, which included provisions for obsolete and damaged inventory of $35.7 million. The provision is determined based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.\nGoodwill impairment assessment\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.\nWe have allocated $362.5 million of goodwill to the MIRROR reporting unit. As of November 1, 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the MIRROR reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of the MIRROR reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment has been recognized.\nWe used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value, supplemented by market analysis, which indicated the fair value of MIRROR was at least 18% higher than its carrying value. The key assumptions of the fair value of the MIRROR reporting unit are the revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, and the discount rate. Our ability to generate expected cashflows is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, trends in the Connected Fitness industry and the desire to exercise at home, our ability to attract new subscribers to grow the community, and to maintain a loyal subscriber base. The fair value of MIRROR is also dependent on the ability of MIRROR to leverage fixed costs and therefore achieve long term profitability. Declining cashflow trends compared to forecast, or other internal or external indicators, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist, and goodwill may be impaired.\nDeferred taxes on undistributed net investment of foreign subsidiaries.\nWe have not recognized U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the net investment in our subsidiaries which we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. This determination is based on the cash flow projections and\noperational and fiscal objectives of each of our foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the projections are subject to revision in the future.\nFor the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that are not indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded a deferred tax liability for the taxes which would be due upon repatriation. For distributions made by our Canadian subsidiaries, the amount of tax payable is partially dependent on how the repatriation transactions are made. The deferred tax liability has been recorded on the basis that we would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be structured as a return of capital, rather than as a dividend, and would not be subject to Canadian withholding tax.\nAs of January 30, 2022, the paid-up-capital balance of the Canadian subsidiaries for tax purposes was $2.0 billion. The net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries was $2.5 billion, of which $1.1 billion was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. The Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital such that we could choose to repatriate the portion of our net investment that is not indefinitely reinvested without paying Canadian withholding tax.\nDeferred income tax liabilities of $3.8 million have been recognized in relation to the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, representing the U.S. state income taxes which would be due upon repatriation. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested amount is approximately $3.2 million.\nIn future periods, if the net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries exceeds their paid-up-capital balance, whether due to the accumulation of profits by these subsidiaries or due to a change in the amount that is indefinitely reinvested, we will record additional deferred tax liabilities for Canadian withholding taxes and our effective tax rate will increase. Absent any changes to paid-up-capital of our Canadian subsidiaries, or permanent re-investment amounts, we expect the effective tax rate to increase in fiscal 2022.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities when a loss is assessed to be probable and its amount is reasonably estimable. If it is reasonably possible that a material loss could occur through ongoing litigation, we provide disclosure in the footnotes to our financial statements. Assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Should we experience adverse court judgments or should negotiated outcomes differ to our expectations with respect to such ongoing litigation it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign currency exchange differences which arise on translation of our international subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.\nWe also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. We also had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in an effort to reduce our exposure to the foreign currency exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Please refer to Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information, including details of the notional amounts outstanding.\nIn the future, in an effort to reduce foreign currency exchange risks, we may enter into further derivative financial instruments including hedging additional currency pairs. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.\nWe currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:\n\u2022the following impacts to the consolidated statements of operations:\n-an increase in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;\n-an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations upon translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;\n-foreign exchange revaluation losses by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities; and\n-derivative valuation gains on forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship;\n\u2022the following impacts to the consolidated balance sheets:\n-an increase in the foreign currency translation adjustment which arises on the translation of our Canadian subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars; and\n-net investment hedge losses from derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts, entered into as net investment hedges of a Canadian subsidiary.\nDuring 2021, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $3.4 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During 2020, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $57.0 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.\nA 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for 2021 would have resulted in lower income from operations of approximately $16.2 million in 2021. This assumes a consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar over the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on our income from operations.\nInterest Rate Risk. Our committed revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to $400.0 million. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 30, 2022, aside from letters of credit of $3.0 million, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.\nOur cash and cash equivalent balances are held in the form of cash on hand, bank balances, and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less, and in money market funds. We do not believe these balances are subject to material interest rate risk.\nCredit Risk. We have cash on deposit with various large, reputable financial institutions and have invested in AAA-rated money market funds. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. We are also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions that are counterparties to our forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is our unrealized gains on our derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. We have not experienced any losses related to these items, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. We seek to minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom we transact. We seek to limit the amount of exposure with any one counterparty.\nInflation\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. During 2021 our product margin was impacted by higher air freight costs compared to 2020 as a result of global supply chain disruption. Sustained air freight cost increases or other inflationary pressures in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs, or we cannot identify cost efficiencies.",
    "item_8": "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nlululemon athletica inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of lululemon athletica inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the consolidated balance sheets of lululemon athletica inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for the 52-week years ended January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and February 2, 2020, including the related notes, appearing under Item 8 and the financial statement schedule appearing under Item15(a)(2) of the Company\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 52-week years ended January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021 and February 2, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of the Company\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nInventory provision\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and management records a provision as necessary to appropriately value inventories that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. Provision expense is recorded in cost of goods sold. As of January 30, 2022, the Company\u2019s consolidated net inventories balance was $966.5 million, inclusive of the inventory provision of $38.0 million. The amount of the inventory provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the inventory provision is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the estimated net realizable value of inventories that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the estimate.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the review of the provision including the assumptions used. These procedures also included, among others: (i) observing the physical condition of inventories during inventory counts; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s process for developing the estimates of net realizable value; (iii) testing the reliability of reports used by management by agreeing to underlying records; (iv) testing the reasonableness of the assumptions about quality, damages, future demand, selling prices and market conditions by considering historical trends and consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit; and (v) corroborating the assumptions with individuals within the product team.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment - MIRROR Reporting Unit\nAs described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s goodwill balance allocated to the MIRROR reporting unit was $362.5 million as of January 30, 2022. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. Generally, management first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If factors indicate that this is the case, management then estimates the fair value of the related reporting unit. As of November 1, 2021, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the MIRROR reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of the MIRROR reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment was recognized. The fair value of the MIRROR reporting unit was estimated by management by using a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are the revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, and the discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the MIRROR reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the reporting unit; (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s discounted cash flow model including the key assumptions related to the revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, and the discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort which involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's annual goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the fair value estimate of the MIRROR reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others: (i) testing management's process for developing the\nfair value estimate; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the discounted cash flow model; (iii) and evaluating the reasonableness of the key assumptions used by management related to the revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, and the discount rate. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates and operating profit margins involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the performance of peer companies; (iii) the consistency with economic and industry forecasts; and (iv) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the Company\u2019s discounted cash flow model and the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nVancouver, Canada\nMarch 29, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2006.\nlululemon athletica inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nlululemon athletica inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nlululemon athletica inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n(Amounts in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nlululemon athletica inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(Amounts in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements\nlululemon athletica inc.\nINDEX FOR NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nlululemon athletica inc.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nNature of operations\nlululemon athletica inc., a Delaware corporation, (\"lululemon\" and, together with its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the \"Company\") is engaged in the design, distribution, and retail of healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel and accessories, which are sold through a chain of company-operated stores, direct to consumer through e-commerce, outlets, sales from pop up locations, sales to wholesale accounts, license and supply arrangements, and warehouse sales. The Company operates stores in the United States, the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\"), Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, France, Ireland, Malaysia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. There were 574, 521, and 491 company-operated stores in operation as of January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and February 2, 2020, respectively.\nOn July 7, 2020, the Company acquired Curiouser Products Inc., dba MIRROR, (\"MIRROR\") which has been consolidated from the date of acquisition. MIRROR generates net revenue from the sale of in-home fitness equipment and associated content subscriptions. Please refer to Note 6. Acquisition for further information.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") caused governments and public health officials to impose restrictions and recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus.\nThe Company temporarily closed almost all of its retail locations for a significant portion of the first two quarters of fiscal 2020. While most of the Company's retail locations have been open since then, certain locations were temporarily closed based on government and health authority guidance.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, various government programs were announced which provide financial relief for affected businesses. The most significant relief measures which the Company qualified for are the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") in the United States, and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (\"CEWS\") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. During fiscal 2020 the Company recognized payroll subsidies totaling $37.1 million under these wage subsidy programs and similar plans in other jurisdictions. These subsidies were recorded as a reduction in the associated wage costs which the Company incurred, and were recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. These subsidies partially offset the wages paid to employees while its retail locations were temporarily closed due to COVID-19. The Company did not recognize any payroll subsidies in fiscal 2021.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted the Company's operations. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company's operations, and in turn, its operating results and financial position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. A resurgence of the pandemic may result in further or prolonged closures of the Company's retail locations and distribution centers, reduce operating hours, interrupt the Company's supply chain, cause changes in guest behavior, and reduce discretionary spending. Such factors could result in the impairment of long-lived assets and right-of-use assets and the need for an increased provision against the carrying value of the Company's inventories.\nBasis of presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been presented in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019 were each 52-week years. Fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 ended on January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and February 2, 2020, respectively, and are referred to as \"2021,\" \"2020,\" and \"2019,\" respectively.\nThe Company's business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail apparel businesses. Historically, the Company has recognized a significant portion of its operating profit in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year as a result of increased net revenue during the holiday season.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lululemon athletica inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, bank balances, and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these balances, and management believes the Company's credit risk to be minimal.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable primarily arise out of duty receivables, sales to wholesale accounts, and license and supply arrangements. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management's best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. Receivables are written off against the allowance when management believes that the amount receivable will not be recovered. As of January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and February 2, 2020, the Company recorded an insignificant allowance for doubtful accounts.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of finished goods, inventories in transit, and raw materials, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs, and includes all costs incurred to deliver inventory to the Company's distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty, and other landing costs.\nThe Company periodically reviews its inventories and makes a provision as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of its inventory below its previous estimate, the Company would increase its reserve in the period in which it made such a determination.\nIn addition, the Company provides for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventory counts. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. The Company performs physical inventory counts and cycle counts throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly.\nBusiness combinations\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred including the acquisition-date fair value of the Company's previously held equity interests. The purchase price is allocated to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess recorded as goodwill. These fair value determinations require judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The purchase price allocation may be provisional during a measurement period of up to one year to provide reasonable time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any such measurement period adjustments are recognized in the period in which the adjustment amount is determined. Transaction costs associated with the acquisition are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and the acquisition-date fair value of the Company's previously held equity interest over the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit which is expected to receive the benefit from the synergies of the combination.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. Generally, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If factors indicate that this is the case, the Company then estimates the fair value of the related reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nIntangible assets\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the asset group to which the intangible assets belong might be impaired. The Company revises the estimated remaining useful life of these assets when events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision. If the Company revises the useful life, the unamortized balance is amortized over the remaining useful life on a prospective basis.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation commences when an asset is ready for its intended use. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which is individually assessed, and estimated to be up to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the expected lease term and the estimated useful life of the improvement, to a maximum of 10 years for stores and 15 years for corporate offices and distribution centers. All other property and equipment are depreciated using the declining balance method as follows:\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nCosts incurred to implement cloud computing service arrangements are initially deferred, and recognized as other non-current assets. Implementation costs are subsequently amortized over the expected term of the related cloud service. The carrying value of cloud computing implementation costs are tested for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that the asset might be impaired. Changes in cloud computing arrangement implementation costs are classified within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or a change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by discounting the future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined.\nLeased property and equipment\nAt lease commencement, which is generally when the Company takes possession of the asset, the Company records a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset. Lease liabilities represent the present value of minimum lease payments over the expected lease term, which includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain those options will be exercised. The present value of the lease liability is determined using the Company's incremental collateralized borrowing rate at the lease commencement.\nMinimum lease payments include base rent, fixed escalation of rental payments, and rental payments that are adjusted periodically depending on a rate or index. In determining minimum lease payments, the Company does not separate non-lease components for real estate leases. Non-lease components are generally services that the lessor performs for the Company associated with the leased asset, such as common area maintenance.\nRight-of-use assets represent the right to control the use of the leased asset during the lease and are initially recognized in an amount equal to the lease liability. In addition, prepaid rent, initial direct costs, and adjustments for lease incentives are components of the right-of-use asset. Over the lease term the lease expense is amortized on a straight-line basis beginning on the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment as part of the impairment of long-lived assets, which is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nVariable lease payments, including contingent rental payments based on sales volume, are recognized when the achievement of the specific target is probable. A right-of-use asset and lease liability are not recognized for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, and the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of asset retirement obligations (\"AROs\") when such obligations are incurred. The Company's AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease, the Company is contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, the Company records an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management's judgment, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company recognizes a liability for a cost associated with a lease exit or disposal activity when such obligation is incurred. A lease exit or disposal liability is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. The Company estimates fair value at the cease-use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals, reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, even where the Company does not intend to enter into a sublease. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from the assumptions used in the initial estimate.\nRevenue recognition\nNet revenue is comprised of company-operated store net revenue, direct to consumer net revenue through websites and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via the Company's distribution centers, and other net revenue, which includes revenue from MIRROR, outlets, temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of the Company's products to licensees. All revenue is reported net of markdowns, discounts, sales taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities, and returns.\nMIRROR generates net revenue from the sale of in-home fitness equipment and associated content subscriptions. Certain in-home fitness contracts contain multiple performance obligations, including hardware and a subscription service commitment. For customer contracts that contain multiple performance obligations the Company accounts for individual performance obligations if they are distinct. The transaction price, net of discounts, is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods or services to the Company's customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. Revenue from company-operated stores and other retail locations is recognized at the point of sale. Direct to consumer revenue, sales to wholesale accounts and in-home fitness hardware sales are recognized upon receipt by the customer. In certain arrangements the Company receives payment before the customer receives the promised good. These payments are initially recorded as deferred revenue, and recognized as revenue in the period when control is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue is presented net of an allowance for estimated returns. The Company's liability for sales return refunds is recognized within other current liabilities, and an asset for the value of inventory which is expected to be returned is recognized within other prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nShipping fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue, and shipping costs are recognized within selling, general and administrative expenses in the same period the related revenue is recognized.\nProceeds from the sale of gift cards are initially deferred and recognized within unredeemed gift card liability on the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when tendered for payment. While the Company will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, to the extent management determines there is no requirement to remit unused card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, the portion of card balances not expected to be redeemed are recognized in net revenue in proportion to the gift cards which have been redeemed, under the redemption recognition method. For 2021, 2020, and 2019, net revenue recognized on unredeemed gift card balances was $18.7 million, $13.7 million, and $11.9 million, respectively.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold includes:\n\u2022the cost of purchased merchandise, which includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable;\n\u2022the cost incurred to deliver inventory to the Company's distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty, and other landing costs;\n\u2022the cost of the Company's distribution centers, such as labor, rent, utilities, and depreciation;\n\u2022the cost of the Company's production, design, research and development, distribution, and merchandising departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and other expenses;\n\u2022occupancy costs such as minimum rent, contingent rent where applicable, property taxes, utilities, and depreciation expense for the Company's company-operated store locations;\n\u2022hemming costs;\n\u2022shrink and inventory provision expense; and\n\u2022the cost of digital content subscription services, including the costs of content creation, studio overhead, and related production departments.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold, intangible asset amortization, or acquisition-related expenses. The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate and retail employee wages and benefits, costs to transport the Company's products from the distribution facilities to the Company's retail locations and e-commerce guests, professional fees, marketing, technology, human resources, accounting, legal, corporate facility and occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization expense other than in cost of goods sold.\nFor 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company incurred costs to transport its products from its distribution facilities to its retail locations and e-commerce guests of $270.8 million, $232.4 million, and $106.7 million, respectively.\nStore pre-opening costs\nOperating costs incurred prior to the opening of new stores are expensed as incurred as selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company follows the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for tax losses, tax credit carryforwards, and other tax attributes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates, for the appropriate tax jurisdiction, that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse.\nThe Company has not recognized U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which the Company has determined to be indefinitely reinvested.\nDeferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The evaluation as to the likelihood of realizing the benefit of a deferred income tax asset is based on the timing of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, taxable income forecasts, and tax-planning strategies. The recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and forecasts, including current and anticipated taxable income, the utilization of previously unrealized non-operating loss carryforwards, and regulatory reviews of tax filings.\nThe Company evaluates its tax filing positions and recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is considered more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. This determination requires the use of significant judgment. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, facts or circumstances change, tax laws change, or new information becomes available. The Company's policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income\ntax matters as part of other income (expense), net. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company treats the global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") tax as a current period expense.\nFair value of financial instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are made using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value:\n\u2022Level 1 - defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n\u2022Level 2 - defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n\u2022Level 3 - defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety by reference to its lowest level of significant input.\nThe Company records cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.\nThe Company holds certain assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which are outlined in Note 14. Fair Value Measurement.\nForeign currency\nThe functional currency for each entity included in these consolidated financial statements that is domiciled outside of the United States is generally the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities of each foreign entity are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Net revenue and expenses are translated at the average rate in effect during the period. Unrealized translation gains and losses are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment, which is included in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss included in stockholders' equity.\nForeign currency transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency with any resulting gains and losses recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses, except for gains and losses arising on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature, which are recorded as a net investment hedge gains (losses) in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain foreign currency exchange rate risks.\nNet investment hedges. The Company enters into certain forward currency contracts that are designated as net investment hedges. The effective portions of the hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, and will subsequently be reclassified to net earnings in the period in which the hedged investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Hedge effectiveness is measured using a method based on changes in forward exchange rates. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The Company also enters into certain forward currency contracts that are not designated as net investment hedges. They are designed to economically hedge the foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses of certain monetary assets and liabilities. The Company has not applied hedge accounting to these instruments and the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its forward currency contracts which are not designated in hedging relationships within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. However, the Company's Master International Swap Dealers Association, Inc., Agreements and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Additional information on the Company's derivative financial instruments is included in Note 14. Fair Value Measurement and Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments.\nConcentration of credit risk\nAccounts receivable are primarily from inventory duty receivables, wholesale accounts, and from license and supply arrangements. The Company generally does not require collateral to support the accounts receivable; however, in certain circumstances, the Company may require parties to provide payment for goods prior to delivery of the goods or to provide letters of credit. The accounts receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is established based on management's assessment of the credit risk of the underlying accounts.\nCash and cash equivalents are held with high quality financial institutions. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. The Company is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is the Company's unrealized gains on its derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these items, and it believes credit risk to be minimal. The Company seeks to minimize its credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom it transacts. It seeks to limit the amount of exposure with any one counterparty.\nThe Company's derivative contracts contain certain credit risk-related contingent features. Under certain circumstances, including an event of default, bankruptcy, termination, and cross default under the Company's North American revolving credit facility, the Company may be required to make immediate payment for outstanding liabilities under its derivative contracts.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant. Awards settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. The employee compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital for awards that are settled in common shares, and with the offsetting credit to accrued compensation and related expenses for awards that are settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee.\nFor awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards expected to vest, reflecting estimated expected forfeitures, and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. The forfeiture rate is based on management's best estimate of expected forfeitures, taking into consideration historical trends and expected future behavior. For awards with performance conditions, the Company recognizes the compensation expense if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance condition at each reporting date.\nThe grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the award date using the Black-Scholes model, and the grant date fair value of restricted shares, performance-based restricted stock units, and restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the award date. Restricted stock units that are settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. This fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last business day before each period end.\nEarnings per share\nEarnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common and exchangeable shares outstanding during the period. Exchangeable shares are the equivalent of common shares in all material respects. All classes of stock have in effect the same rights and share equally in undistributed net income. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to stockholders for the period by the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution from common shares issuable through stock options, performance-based restricted stock units that have satisfied their performance factor, restricted shares, and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method.\nContingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. The Company records contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nThe Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standard Updates (\"ASUs\"). ASUs adopted during 2021 not listed below were assessed, and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued guidance on ASC 740, Income Taxes. The amendments in this update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740. The amendments also improve consistent application and make simplifications in other areas of this topic by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The Company adopted this update during the first quarter of 2021 and it did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\") to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a lease liability, which represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASC 842 on February 4, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach with no restatement of comparative periods.\nThe Company has chosen to apply the transition package of three practical expedients which allow companies not to reassess whether agreements contain leases, the classification of leases, and the capitalization of initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the practical expedient to use hindsight when determining the lease term.\nThe primary financial statement impact upon adoption was the recognition, on a discounted basis, of the Company's minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases as right-of-use assets and obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. As of February 4, 2019, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were $619.6 million and $651.1 million, respectively. Pre-existing lease balances of $34.8 million from current assets, $9.3 million from non-current assets, and $75.5 million from non-current liabilities were reclassified to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as part of the adoption of the new standard. There was no cumulative earnings effect adjustment on transition.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nASUs recently issued not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASC 832, Government Assistance to require annual disclosures about the nature of certain government assistance received, the accounting policy used to account for the transactions, the location in the financial statements where such transactions were recorded and significant terms and conditions associated with such transactions. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3. INVENTORIES\nThe Company had write-offs of $27.5 million, $20.5 million, and $28.6 million of inventory in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively for goods that were obsolete, had quality issues, or were damaged.\nNOTE 4. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nNOTE 5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nThere were capitalized computer software costs of $35.8 million, $23.5 million, and $20.7 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, associated with internally developed software.\nDepreciation expense related to property and equipment was $215.3 million, $180.1 million, and $161.8 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nNOTE 6. ACQUISITION\nOn July 7, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of MIRROR, an in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform that features live and on-demand classes. The results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of MIRROR have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred at the date of acquisition, as well as the calculation of goodwill based on the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired. As part of the transaction, the Company assumed $30.1 million of MIRROR's outstanding debt. This included $15.1 million of external debt that was settled as part of the transaction and $15.0 million of debt previously owed by MIRROR to the Company, which\nrepresents the effective settlement of a preexisting relationship. The debt was determined to be at market terms and was recognized as a component of the consideration transferred, and no gain or loss was recorded on settlement.\nGoodwill relates to benefits expected as a result of the acquisition to MIRROR's business and has been allocated to the MIRROR reporting unit which is included within Other in the Company's segment disclosures. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Company assigned a fair value to and estimated useful lives for the intangible assets acquired as part of the MIRROR business combination. The fair value of the separately identifiable intangible assets, and their estimated useful lives as of the acquisition date were as follows:\nAccounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions to derive the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, and in the case of MIRROR, this is with specific reference to acquired intangible assets. The fair value of intangible assets was based upon widely-accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and relief from royalty and replacement cost methods, depending on the nature of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed. Inherent in each valuation technique are critical assumptions, including future revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and the discount rate. The recognition of deferred tax assets in relation to the historic net operating losses of MIRROR relied on assumptions and estimates of the future profitability of the Company's U.S. operations.\nThe Company has not disclosed pro forma information of the combined business as the transaction is not material to revenue or net earnings.\nAcquisition-related expenses\nIn connection with the acquisition, the Company recognized certain acquisition-related expenses which are expensed as incurred. These expenses are recognized within acquisition-related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations include the following amounts:\n\u2022acquisition-related compensation, including the partial acceleration of vesting of certain stock options, and amounts due to selling shareholders and MIRROR employees that are contingent upon continuing employment;\n\u2022transaction and integration costs, including fees for advisory and professional services incurred as part of the acquisition and integration costs subsequent to the acquisition; and\n\u2022gain recognized on the Company's existing investment in the acquiree as of the acquisition date.\nThe following table summarizes the acquisition-related expenses recognized during 2021 and 2020:\nIn connection with the acquisition, $2.9 million was recognized on the acquisition date for the partial acceleration of vesting of certain stock options held by MIRROR employees, and $57.1 million of consideration was deferred up to three years from the acquisition date, subject to the continued employment of the recipients through various vesting dates. The acquisition-related compensation was expensed over the vesting periods as service was provided, and consisted of cash payments, which are included within accrued compensation and related expenses until payments are made, and stock-based compensation awards that have been granted under the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan to replace certain unvested options as of the acquisition date.\nIn September 2021, MIRROR's Chief Executive Officer transitioned into an advisory role with the Company. The remaining deferred consideration payable to this individual will be paid in July 2022. Due to the reduction in this individual's responsibilities, the compensation expense was accelerated and recognized in full during the third quarter of 2021.\nNOTE 7. GOODWILL\nThe changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill were as follows:\nOf the Company's goodwill as of January 30, 2022, $362.5 million relates to the MIRROR reporting unit that is included within Other in the Company's segment disclosures. The remaining $24.4 million relates to the company-operated stores segment.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis for the MIRROR and company-operated stores reporting units, using an income approach to estimate fair value, and determined there was no impairment loss for the year as of January 30, 2022.\nNOTE 8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nA summary of the balances of the Company's intangible assets as of January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, is presented below:\nAmortization of intangible assets was $8.8 million, $5.2 million, and $29.0 thousand in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. There were no impairment charges in 2021, 2020, and 2019. The following table presents the future expected amortization expense as of January 30, 2022:\nNOTE 9. OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS\nAs of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, cloud computing arrangement implementation costs consisted of deferred costs of $138.4 million and $92.1 million, respectively, and associated accumulated amortization of $49.0 million and $17.5 million, respectively.\nNOTE 10. ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER\nNOTE 11. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES\nNorth America revolving credit facility\nOn December 14, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement extending its existing credit facility, which provides for $400.0 million in commitments under an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. The credit facility has a maturity date of December 14, 2026, subject to extension under certain circumstances. Borrowings under the credit facility may be prepaid and commitments may be reduced or terminated without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs).\nAs of January 30, 2022, aside from letters of credit of $3.0 million, the Company had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.\nBorrowings made under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, either (a) a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\"SOFR\"), or (b) an alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and rent (\"EBITDAR\") and ranges between 1.000%-1.375% for SOFR loans and 0.000%-0.375% for alternate base rate or Canadian prime rate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 0.100%-0.200%, also determined by reference to the pricing grid, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the credit facility.\nThe applicable interest rates and commitment fees are subject to adjustment based on certain sustainability key performance indicators (\"KPIs\"). The two KPIs are based on greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction and gender pay equity, and its performance against certain targets measured on an annual basis could result in positive or negative\nsustainability rate adjustments of 2.50 basis points to its drawn pricing and positive or negative sustainability fee adjustments of 0.50 basis points to its undrawn pricing.\nThe credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all or substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions.\nThe Company's financial covenants include maintaining an operating lease adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.25:1.00 and the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) of not less than 2.00:1.00. The credit agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the credit agreement may be terminated, and the maturity of any outstanding amounts may be accelerated. As of January 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility.\nMainland China revolving credit facility\nIn December 2019, the Company entered into an uncommitted and unsecured 130.0 million Chinese Yuan ($20.4 million) revolving credit facility with terms that are reviewed on an annual basis. The credit facility was increased to 230.0 million Chinese Yuan ($36.2 million) during 2020. It comprises a revolving loan of up to 200.0 million Chinese Yuan ($31.4 million) and a financial guarantee facility of up to 30.0 million Chinese Yuan ($4.7 million), or its equivalent in another currency. Loans are available for a period not to exceed 12 months, at an interest rate equal to the loan prime rate plus a spread of 0.5175%. The Company is required to follow certain covenants. As of January 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the covenant and, aside from letters of credit of 6.1 million Chinese Yuan ($1.0 million), there were no other borrowings or guarantees outstanding under this credit facility.\n364-Day revolving credit facility\nIn June 2020, the Company obtained a 364-day $300.0 million committed and unsecured revolving credit facility. In December 2020, the Company elected to terminate this credit facility.\nNOTE 12. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nSpecial voting stock and exchangeable shares\nThe holders of the special voting stock are entitled to one vote for each share held. The special voting shares are not entitled to receive dividends or distributions or receive any consideration in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or wind-up. To the extent that exchangeable shares as described below are exchanged for common stock, a corresponding number of special voting shares will be cancelled without consideration.\nThe holders of the exchangeable shares have dividend and liquidation rights equivalent to those of holders of the common shares of the Company. The exchangeable shares can be converted on a one for one basis by the holder at any time into common shares of the Company plus a cash payment for any accrued and unpaid dividends. Holders of exchangeable shares are entitled to the same or economically equivalent dividend as declared on the common stock of the Company. The exchangeable shares are non-voting. The Company has the right to convert the exchangeable shares into common shares of the Company at any time after the earliest of July 26, 2047, the date on which fewer than 4.2 million exchangeable shares are outstanding, or in the event of certain events such as a change in control.\nNOTE 13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS\nStock-based compensation plans\nThe Company's eligible employees participate in various stock-based compensation plans, provided directly by the Company.\nIn June 2014, the Company's stockholders approved the adoption of the lululemon athletica inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2014 Plan\"). The 2014 Plan provides for awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted share bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance-based restricted stock units, cash-based awards, other stock-based awards, and deferred compensation awards to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees), consultants, and directors of the Company.\nThe Company has granted stock options, performance-based restricted stock units, restricted stock units, and restricted shares. Stock options granted to date generally have a four-year vesting period and vest at a rate of 25% each year on the anniversary date of the grant. Stock options generally expire on the earlier of seven years from the date of grant, or a specified period of time following termination. Performance-based restricted stock units issued generally vest three years from the grant date and restricted shares generally vest one year from the grant date. Restricted stock units granted generally have a three-year vesting period and vest at a certain percentage each year on the anniversary date of the grant.\nThe Company issues previously unissued shares upon the exercise of Company options, vesting of performance-based restricted stock units or restricted stock units that are settled in common stock, and granting of restricted shares.\nStock-based compensation expense charged to income for the plans was $66.4 million, $56.6 million, and $46.1 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost for all stock-based compensation plans was $96.7 million as of January 30, 2022, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years, and was $75.7 million as of January 31, 2021 over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.\nA summary of the balances of the Company's stock-based compensation plans as of January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and February 2, 2020, and changes during the fiscal years then ended is presented below:\nA total of 12.6 million shares of the Company's common stock have been authorized for future issuance under the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.\nThe Company's performance-based restricted stock units are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive a maximum of two shares of common stock per performance-based restricted stock unit if the Company achieves specified performance goals and the grantee remains employed during the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. Expense for performance-based restricted stock units is recognized when it is probable that the performance goal will be achieved.\nThe grant date fair value of the restricted shares and restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the award date. Restricted stock units that are settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. This fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last business day before each period end.\nThe grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The closing price of the Company's common stock on the award date is used in the model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Company's historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon the historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. The following are weighted averages of the assumptions that were used in calculating the fair value of stock options granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable as of January 30, 2022:\nAs of January 30, 2022, the unrecognized compensation cost related to these options was $24.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $94.09, $74.91, and $54.09, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the intrinsic value of options exercised and awards that vested during 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nEmployee share purchase plan\nThe Company's board of directors and stockholders approved the Company's Employee Share Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") in September 2007. Contributions are made by eligible employees, subject to certain limits defined in the ESPP, and the Company matches one-third of the contribution. The maximum number of shares authorized to be purchased under the ESPP is 6.0 million shares. All shares purchased under the ESPP are purchased in the open market. During 2021, there were 0.1 million shares purchased.\nDefined contribution pension plans\nThe Company offers defined contribution pension plans to its eligible employees. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to a plan up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws. The Company matches 50% to 75% of the contribution depending on the participant's length of service, and the contribution is subject to a two year vesting period. The Company's net expense for the defined contribution plans was $11.8 million, $9.2 million, and $8.5 million during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nNOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nAs of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the Company held certain assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nThe Company has short-term, highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents, which are invested in money market funds and term deposits. The Company records cash equivalents at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate.\nThe fair values of the forward currency contract assets and liabilities are determined using observable Level 2 inputs, including foreign currency spot exchange rates, forward pricing curves, and interest rates. The fair values consider the credit risk of the Company and its counterparties. The Company's Master International Swap Dealers Association, Inc., Agreements and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions. However, the Company records all derivatives on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value and does not offset derivative assets and liabilities.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nThe Company has also recorded lease termination liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis, determined using Level 3 inputs based on remaining lease rentals and reduced by estimated sublease income.\nNOTE 15. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company currently hedges against changes in the Canadian dollar and Chinese Yuan to the U.S. dollar exchange rate and changes in the Euro and Australian dollar to the Canadian dollar exchange rate using forward currency contracts.\nNet investment hedges\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses which arise on translation of its international subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars. These gains and losses are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.\nThe Company holds a significant portion of its assets in Canada and enters into forward currency contracts designed to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. These forward currency contracts are designated as net investment hedges. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges during 2021.\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nDuring 2021, the Company entered into certain forward currency contracts designed to economically hedge the foreign currency exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by its Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on specific monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. The Company has not applied hedge accounting to these instruments and the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nQuantitative disclosures about derivative financial instruments\nThe notional amounts and fair values of forward currency contracts were as follows:\nAs of January 30, 2022, there were derivative assets of $19.1 million and derivative liabilities of $19.0 million subject to enforceable netting arrangements.\nThe forward currency contracts designated as net investment hedges outstanding as of January 30, 2022 mature on different dates between February 2022 and August 2022.\nThe forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship outstanding as of January 30, 2022 mature on different dates between February 2022 and July 2022.\nThe pre-tax gains and losses on foreign currency exchange forward contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss were as follows:\nNo gains or losses have been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss into net income for derivative financial instruments in a net investment hedging relationship, as the Company has not sold or liquidated (or substantially liquidated) its hedged subsidiary.\nThe pre-tax net foreign currency exchange and derivative gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statement of operations were as follows:\nNOTE 16. LEASES\nThe Company has obligations under operating leases for its store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment. As of January 30, 2022, the lease terms of the various leases range from two to fifteen years. The majority of the Company's leases include renewal options at the sole discretion of the Company. In general, it is not reasonably certain that lease renewals will be exercised at lease commencement and therefore lease renewals are not included in the lease term.\nThe following table details the Company's net lease expense. Certain of the Company's leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays, and leasehold rental incentives. The majority of the Company's leases for store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume. The variable lease expenses disclosed below include contingent rent payments and other non-fixed lease related costs, including common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's insurance.\nThe following table presents future minimum lease payments by fiscal year and the impact of discounting.\nAs of January 30, 2022, the Company's minimum lease commitment for distribution center operating leases signed but not yet commenced was $379.7 million, which is not reflected in the table above.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate were as follows:\nNOTE 17. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company's domestic and foreign income before income tax expense and current and deferred income taxes from federal, state, and foreign sources are as follows:\nThe U.S. tax reforms enacted in December 2017 required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% on cash and cash equivalents and 8% on the remaining earnings, net of foreign tax credits. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years.\nAs of January 30, 2022, the Company's net investment in its Canadian subsidiaries was $2.5 billion, of which $1.1 billion was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. A deferred income tax liability of $3.8 million has been recognized in relation to the portion of the Company's net investment in its Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, representing the U.S. state income taxes which would be due upon repatriation. This deferred tax liability has been recorded on the basis that the Company would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be structured as a return of capital, and therefore not subject to Canadian withholding tax. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested amount is approximately $3.2 million.\nNo deferred income tax liabilities have been recognized on any of the undistributed earnings of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States. Excluding its Canadian subsidiaries, cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries as of January 30, 2022 were $168.8 million.\nAs of January 30, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion outside of the United States.\nA summary reconciliation of the effective tax rate is as follows:\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021 are presented below:\nAs of January 30, 2022, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $31.5 million. The majority of the net operating loss carryforwards expire, if unused, between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2039.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S., Canada, and various foreign, state, and provincial jurisdictions. The 2017 to 2020 tax years remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The 2013 tax year is still open for certain state tax authorities. The 2015 to 2020 tax years remain subject to examination by Canadian tax authorities. The 2015 to 2020 tax years remain subject to examination by tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company\ndoes not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in the Company's tax returns.\nNOTE 18. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe details of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:\nThe Company's calculation of weighted-average shares includes the common stock of the Company as well as the exchangeable shares. Exchangeable shares are the equivalent of common shares in all material respects. All classes of stock have in effect the same rights and share equally in undistributed net income. For 2021, 2020, and 2019, 36.0 thousand, 30.8 thousand, and 48.0 thousand stock options and awards, respectively, were anti-dilutive to earnings per share and therefore have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.\nOn November 29, 2017, the Company's board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $200.0 million and on June 6, 2018, the board of directors approved an increase to this stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to a total of $600.0 million of the Company's common shares. These programs were completed during the first quarter of 2019.\nOn January 31, 2019, the Company's board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $500.0 million of the Company's common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. On December 1, 2020, the Company's board of directors approved an increase in the remaining authorization of the existing stock repurchase program from $263.6 million to $500.0 million, and on October 1, 2021, it approved an increase in the remaining authorization from $141.2 million to $641.2 million. The repurchase plan has no time limit and does not require the repurchase of a minimum number of shares. Common shares repurchased on the open market are at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing and actual number of common shares to be repurchased will depend upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements. As of January 30, 2022, the remaining authorized value of shares available to be repurchased under this program was $187.4 million.\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019, 2.2 million, 0.4 million, and 1.1 million shares, respectively, were repurchased under the programs at a total cost of $812.6 million, $63.7 million, and $173.4 million, respectively.\nSubsequent to January 30, 2022, and up to March 23, 2022, 0.6 million shares were repurchased at a total cost of $187.5 million, completing the existing stock repurchase program.\nNOTE 19.

The Company retains the rights to sell lululemon products through its e-commerce websites in these countries. Under these arrangements, the Company supplies the partners with lululemon products, training, and other support. An extension to the initial term of the agreement for the Middle East was signed in 2020 and it extends the arrangement to December 2024. The initial term of the agreement for Mexico expires in November 2026. As of January 30, 2022, there were 14 licensed locations, including six in Mexico, six in the United Arab Emirates, one in Kuwait, and one in Qatar.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual arrangements as of January 30, 2022, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nDeferred consideration. The amounts listed for deferred consideration in the table above represent expected future cash payments for certain continuing MIRROR employees, subject to the continued employment of those individuals up to three years from the acquisition date as outlined in Note 6. Acquisition.\nOne-time transition tax payable. The U.S. tax reforms enacted in December 2017 imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The one-time transition tax payable is net of foreign tax credits, and the table above outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.\nContingencies\nLegal proceedings. In addition to the legal proceedings described below, the Company is, from time to time, involved in routine legal matters, and audits and inspections by governmental agencies and other third parties which are incidental to the conduct of its business. This includes legal matters such as initiation and defense of proceedings to protect intellectual property rights, personal injury claims, product liability claims, employment claims, and similar matters. The Company believes the ultimate resolution of any such legal proceedings, audits, and inspections will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated balance sheets, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recognized immaterial provisions related to the expected outcome of legal proceedings.\nIn April 2020, Aliign Activation Wear, LLC filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging federal trademark infringement, false designation of origin and unfair competition. The plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief, monetary damages and declaratory relief. The Company obtained summary judgment that the Company did not infringe upon any of the plaintiff's rights and the district court entered judgment in the Company's favor on all claims. The plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Company intends to defend its win at the appellate level.\nIn April 2021, DISH Technologies L.L.C., and Sling TV L.L.C. (DISH) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and, along with DISH DBS Corporation, also with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against the Company and its Curiouser Products subsidiary (MIRROR), along with ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., FreeMotion Fitness, Inc., NordicTrack, Inc., and Peloton Interactive, Inc., alleging infringement of various patents related to fitness devices containing internet-streaming enabled video displays. In the ITC complaint, DISH seeks an exclusion order barring the importation of MIRROR fitness devices, streaming components and systems containing components that infringe one or more of the asserted patents as well as a cease and desist order preventing the Company from carrying out commercial activities within the United States related to those products. In the District of Delaware complaint, DISH is seeking an order permanently enjoining the Company from infringing the asserted patents, an award of damages for the infringement of the asserted patents, and an award of damages for lost sales. The ITC investigation is ongoing and the Delaware litigation remains stayed pending resolution to the ITC investigation. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter.\nNOTE 20. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nNOTE 21. SEGMENTED INFORMATION\nThe Company's segments are based on the financial information it uses in managing its business and comprise two reportable segments: (i) company-operated stores and (ii) direct to consumer. The remainder of its operations which includes outlets, temporary locations, MIRROR, sales to wholesale accounts, and license and supply arrangements are included within Other.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company reviewed its segment and general corporate expenses and determined certain costs that are more appropriately classified in different categories. Accordingly, comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the financial presentation adopted for the prior year.\nIntercompany amounts are excluded from the above table as they are not included in the materials reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. The amortization of intangible assets in the above table includes $8.7 million and $5.1 million related to MIRROR for 2021 and 2020, respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report, or the Evaluation Date. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource limitations on all control systems; no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",
