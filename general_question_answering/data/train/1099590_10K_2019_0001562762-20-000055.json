    "item_1": "ITEM 1.\nBUS INESS\nMercadoLibre, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries \u201cus\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is the largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America based on unique visitors and page views, and is present in 18 countries: Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay and El Salvador. Our platform is designed to provide users with a complete portfolio of services to facilitate commercial transactions both online and offline.\nWe offer our users an ecosystem of six integrated e-commerce and digital payments services: the Mercado Libre Marketplace, the Mercado Pago FinTech platform, the Mercado Envios logistics service, the Mercado Libre advertising solution, the Mercado Libre Classifieds service and the Mercado Shops online webstores solution.\nThrough our e-commerce platform, we provide buyers and sellers with a robust environment that fosters the development of a large e-commerce community in Latin America, a region with a population of over 644 million people and with one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration rates in the world. We believe that we offer technological and commercial solutions that address the distinctive cultural and geographic challenges of operating an online commerce platform in Latin America.\nThe Mercado Libre Marketplace is a fully-automated, topically-arranged and user-friendly online commerce platform, which can be accessed through our website and mobile app. This platform enables both businesses and individuals to list merchandise and conduct sales and purchases online.\nTo complement the Mercado Libre Marketplace and also to enhance the user experience for our buyers and sellers, we developed Mercado Pago an integrated online payments solution, was initially designed to facilitate transactions on MercadoLibre\u2019s Marketplaces by providing a mechanism that allowed our users to securely, easily and promptly send and receive payments. Our payments solution enables any MercadoLibre registered user to securely and easily send and receive payments online and also to pay for purchases made on MercadoLibre\u2019s Marketplaces. Currently, Mercado Pago processes and settles all transactions on our Marketplaces in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, and Colombia, and is also available for our buyers and sellers in Peru and Uruguay.\nThe Mercado Envios logistics solution enables sellers on our platform to utilize third-party carriers and other logistics services providers, and provides them with fulfillment and warehousing services. The logistics services we offer are an integral part of our value proposition, as it reduces friction between buyers and sellers, and it allows us to have greater control over the user experience. Sellers that opt into our logistics solutions are not only able to offer a uniform and seamlessly integrated shipping experience to their buyers at competitive prices, but are also eligible to access shipping subsidies to offer free or discounted shipping for many of their sales on our marketplaces.\nBeyond facilitating Marketplace transactions, over the years we have been expanding our array of Mercado Pago services to third parties outside MercadoLibre\u2019s Marketplace. We began first by satisfying the growing demand for online-based payment solutions by providing merchants the necessary digital payment infrastructure for e-commerce to flourish in Latin America. Mercado Pago\u2019s online payments business allows merchants to facilitate checkout and payment processes on their websites through a branded or white label solution or software development kits, while also enabling users to simply transfer money to each other either through the website or using the Mercado Pago app. Through Mercado Pago we brought trust to the merchant-customer relationship, allowing online consumers to shop easily and safely, while giving them the confidence to share sensitive personal and financial data with us.\nAs we deployed our online-based payments solutions, we also observed that individuals, micro merchants and small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 (\u201cSMEs\u201d) in the physical world were being underserved or overlooked by incumbent payment providers and financial institutions in Latin America and that a very large number of retail transactions were still settled in cash throughout the region. Consequently, we have also aggressively deepened our payments offerings by growing our online-to-offline (\u201cO2O\u201d) products and services. We envision Mercado Pago as a powerful disruptive provider of end-to-end financial technology solutions that will generate financial inclusion to segments of the population that have been historically underserved and operate in the informal economy today.\nWe currently offer in our main markets solutions for:\n\uf0b7In-store physical payments by selling MPOS and quick response (\u201cQR\u201d) payment codes;\n\uf0b7Digital payment solutions for utilities, mobile phone top up, peer-to-peer payments and more through our mobile wallet;\n\uf0b7Pre-paid cards for users to spend and withdraw their account balances from their Mercado Pago wallet, as well as co-branded credit cards in Argentina;\n\uf0b7Merchant credits on and off the Mercado Libre Marketplace and Consumer Credits on the Mercado Libre Marketplace; and\n\uf0b7A money market fund to invest balances on Mercado Pago accounts, which we market under the name Mercado Fondo.\nIn July 2015 we began to expand our O2O payments offering by launching our MPOS initiative in Brazil, Mercado Pago Point, which allows long-tail merchants, SMEs, and individuals not only to receive in-person payments, but most importantly to enable them to offer installments on the products and services they historically sold only in cash. Our MPOS solution allows merchants and individuals to process physical credit and debit cards, either by reading the chip and entering a personal identification number (PIN) or by swiping it. Our MPOS device was designed specifically to fit the needs of underserved or overlooked individuals and SMEs, as we do not require a rental fee for the device and offer a competitive transaction fee structure that gives them the flexibility to advance their sales. It also gives these users access to our full suite of FinTech solutions by integrating with the Mercado Pago app and pre-paid card, without needing a bank account. We subsequently launched our physical point-of-sale solution in Argentina and Mexico during 2016.\nThe results of our MPOS business not only have been encouraging, but also have given us greater confidence that we are well positioned to capitalize on a large opportunity in payments and FinTech in the region. Since its launch, Mercado Pago Point has grown significantly and in Brazil total payment volume coming from MPOS devices is already double the volume of our online merchant service business.\nWe launched Mercado Credito, our credit solution, during the fourth quarter of 2016 in Argentina and during 2017 in Brazil and Mexico. Mercado Credito leverages our user base, which is not only loyal and engaged, but also has been historically underserved or overlooked by financial institutions and suffers from a lack of access to needed credit. Facilitating credit is a key service overlay that enables us to further strengthen the engagement and lock-in rate of our users, while also generating additional touchpoints and incentives to use Mercado Pago as an end-to-end financial solution. Initially, we began offering credit to our merchants given our distribution capabilities and in-depth understanding of their sales on the Mercado Libre Marketplace. This has also allowed us to develop our own proprietary credit risk models with unique data that differentiate our scoring from traditional financial institutions, as we are able to leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms that we historically used for fraud prevention. Additionally, because our merchants\u2019 business flows through Mercado Pago, we are able to collect principal and interest payments from their existing sales on MercadoLibre\u2019s Marketplaces, meaningfully reducing the risk of uncollectability on the loans we originate to our merchants.\nHaving identified a similar opportunity to fill a gap in terms of demand for credit, we have begun to originate working capital loans to merchants who adopt our MPOS solutions. Merchant credit to MPOS merchants was launched in Argentina and Brazil during the second half of 2018.\nBecause a significant segment of the population in Latin America does not have access to credit cards, and given that the access to credit is an enabler for consumers when purchasing high-ticket items, we have also identified a significant opportunity for consumer lending. We have begun to extend consumer credit to our buyers as well, leveraging their existing data on MercadoLibre\u2019s Marketplaces and the distribution from our marketplace to proactively offer loans to them. Mercado Credito was introduced in Argentina in 2017, in Brazil in 2018 and in Mexico in 2019. Additionally, during 2019, as we better understand consumer\u2019s behavior on our marketplace, we have rolled out Mercado Credito to selected buyers so that they can buy products and services off-platform in Argentina and Brazil.\nDuring the second half of 2018, we launched our asset management product for individuals in Argentina and for individuals and businesses in Brazil. This product is a critical pillar to building our alternative two-sided network vision. It incentivizes our users to begin to fund their digital wallets with cash as opposed to credit or debit cards given that the return our product offers is greater than traditional checking accounts.\nWith a seamless onboarding, this product allows users to withdraw and use the value stored in their digital wallets at any given time through QR code in-store payments, pre-paid cards, or cash withdrawn from an ATM, without requiring that their funds be trapped in a money market fund or a certificate of deposit to obtain an equivalent return. This product is another way in which we continue to innovate, leveraging the rising trust in third-party e-commerce platforms and low levels of formal sector financial inclusion, which generate a unique opportunity for investment products aimed at users in Latin America who are unbanked or underbanked.\nOur advertising platform enables businesses to promote their products and services on the Internet. Through our advertising platform, brands and sellers are able to display ads on our webpages through product searches, banner ads, or suggested products. Our advertising platform enables merchants and brands to have access to the millions of consumers that are on our marketplaces at any given time with the intent to purchase, which increases the likelihood of conversion.\nThrough Mercado Libre Classifieds, our online classified listing service, our users can also list and purchase motor vehicles, real estate and services in the countries where we operate. Classifieds listings differ from Marketplace listings as they only charge optional placement fees and not final value fees. Our classifieds pages are also a major source of traffic to our platform, benefitting both the Enhanced Marketplace and non-Marketplace businesses.\nComplementing the services we offer, our online store solution, Mercado Shops allows users to set up, manage and promote their own online stores. These stores are hosted by Mercado Libre and offer integration with the rest of our ecosystem, namely our marketplaces and payment services. Users can select between a free model and a subscription-based model for enhanced functionalities and value added services on their store.\n\u200e\nThe following table shows the main services currently available in each country:\n(*) Mercado Credito, our credit solution of Mercado Pago is available in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.\nOur strategy\nOur main focus is to serve people in Latin America by enabling wide access to retail and payments e-commerce services, providing compelling technology-based solutions that democratize commerce and money, thus contributing to the development of a large and growing digital economy in a region with a population of over 644 million people and one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration rates in the world.\nWe serve our buyers by giving them access to a broad and affordable variety of products and services, a selection we believe to be larger than otherwise available to them via other online and offline sources serving our Latin American markets. We believe we serve our sellers by giving them access to a larger and more geographically diverse user base at a lower overall cost and investment than offline venues serving our Latin American markets. Additionally, we provide payment settlement services to facilitate such transactions, and advertising solutions to promote them. We also serve our users by making capital more accessible through different credit products, fostering entrepreneurship and social mobility, with the goal of creating significant value for our stockholders.\nMore broadly, we strive to make inefficient markets more efficient through technology and in that process also generate value for our stockholders.\nTo achieve these objectives, we intend to pursue the following strategies:\n\uf0b7Continue to improve shopping experience for our users. We intend to continually enhance our e-commerce ecosystem in order to better serve individuals, brands, retailers and other businesses that want to buy or sell goods and services online in a convenient, simple and safe way. We are committed to continue investing in the development of new tools and technologies that facilitate web and mobile commerce on our platform. Within our constant focus on innovation, a key component of user experience is the vertical solutions we offer across key categories. We will continue to focus on improving the functionality of our websites and apps, building a verticalized experience in key categories, driving increased usage of our payments and shipping solutions to deliver a more efficient and safe shopping experience and providing our users with the help of a dedicated customer support department. We will continue to focus on increasing purchase frequency and transaction volumes from our existing users, including the development of our Mercado Puntos loyalty program for frequent buyers.\n\uf0b7Continue to grow our business and maintain market leadership. We focus on growing our business, achieving as many scale-related competitive advantages and strengthening our position as a preferred commerce and payments platform in each of the markets in which we operate. We also intend to grow our business and maintain our leadership by taking advantage of the expanding potential user base that has resulted from the growth of Internet penetration rates in Latin America. We intend to achieve these goals through organic growth, by introducing our business in new countries and entering new category segments, by launching new transactional business lines, and through potential strategic acquisitions of key businesses and assets.\n\uf0b7Expand into additional transactional service offerings. Our strategic focus is to enable online transactions of multiple types of goods and services throughout Latin America. Consequently, we strive to launch online transactional offerings in new product and service categories where we believe business opportunities exist. These new transactional offerings include, but are not limited to, efforts involving: (a) offering additional product categories in our marketplace, (b) expanding our presence in vehicle, real estate and services classifieds, (c) maximizing utilization of Mercado Pago on our platform and expanding off-platform in online and offline transactions, (d) maximize the value and usage of account money through investments in Mercado Fondo ,(e) maximizing utilization of Mercado Envios, (f) expanding our Mercado Credito service, (g) offering enterprise software solutions to our online commerce business clients and (h) expanding our advertising offerings. We believe that a significant portion of our growth will be derived from these new or expanded product and service launches in the future.\n\uf0b7Increase monetization of our transactions. We focus on improving the revenue generation capacity of our business by implementing initiatives designed to maximize the revenues we generate from transactions on our platform. Some of these initiatives include increasing our fee structure, selling advertising on our platform, offering other e-commerce services and expanding our fee-based features.\n\uf0b7Take advantage of the natural synergies that exist between our services. We strive to leverage our various services and our Mercado Puntos loyalty program, to promote greater cross-usage and synergies, thereby creating a fully integrated ecosystem of e-commerce offerings. Consequently, we will continue to promote the adoption of our Mercado Envios logistics solution, our advertising solution, and our Mercado Pago payments solution on our Marketplace.\nEnhanced Marketplace\nEnhanced Marketplace is comprised of Mercado Libre Marketplace Service and Mercado Envios Service.\nNon-Marketplace Services\nNon-Marketplace Services are comprised of our Mercado Pago Service, Mercado Libre Classifieds Service, Mercado Libre Advertising Service, Mercado Shops Webstores Service and other anciliarry businesses.\nMarketing\nOur marketing strategy is designed to grow our platform by promoting the Mercado Libre and Mercado Pago brands, attracting new users, generating more frequent trading by our existing users and cross-selling services among our existing user base. To this end, we employ various means of advertising, including placement in leading online channels across Latin America, paid and organic positioning in leading search engines, email and push notification marketing, onsite marketing, presence in offline events and use of targeted promotional discount coupons. During 2019, we also launched Branding campaigns for Mercado Libre and Mercado Pago, executed on open TV, cable TV, Radio, Billboards and on online channels such as YouTube. We continued carrying out a complete coverage of promotional campaigns on commercial dates such as Child\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day, Christmas and dates specific to the e-commerce industry such as Hot Sale, CyberMonday and Black Friday. Our expenditures in marketing activities were $439.3 million during 2019 and $249.6 million during 2018.\nProduct Development and Technology\nAt December 31, 2019, we had 3,492 employees on our information technology and product development staff, an increase from 1,083 employees at December 31, 2018, due to new hires and as a consequence of improvements in our ecosystem products such as Mercado Credito, our loyalty program Mercado Puntos and Mercado Envios, which increased our information technology and product development staff. We incurred product development expenses (including salaries) in the amount of $223.8 million in 2019 and $146.3 million in 2018.\nWe continually work to improve both our Mercado Libre Marketplace and Mercado Pago websites so that they better serve our users\u2019 needs and function more efficiently. A significant portion of our information technology resources are allocated to these purposes. We strive to maintain the right balance between offering new features and enhancing the existing functionality and architecture of our software and hardware.\nThe effective management of the Mercado Libre Marketplace and Mercado Pago software architecture and hardware requirements is as important as introducing additional and better features for our users. Because our business has grown relatively fast, we must ensure that our systems are capable of absorbing this incremental volume. Therefore, our engineers work to optimize our processes and equipment by designing more effective ways to run our platform.\nWe develop most of our software technology in-house. We have two development centers in Buenos Aires and one in C\u00f3rdoba where we concentrate the majority of our development efforts, in addition to that we do have development centers in San Luis, Mendoza, Santa Fe and Entre Rios in Argentina. We also have other research and/or development centers in Uruguay, Brazil and Chile.\nWe have made acquisitions in the past to enhance our software development capabilities, and we outsource certain projects to outside developers. We believe that outsourcing the development of certain projects allows us to have a greater operating capacity and strengthens our internal know-how by incorporating new expertise into our business. In addition, our developers frequently interact with technology suppliers and attend technology-related events to familiarize themselves with the latest inventions and developments in the field.\nWe also rely on certain technologies that we license from third parties, suppliers of key database technology, operating system and specific hardware components for our services.\nSince 2010, we have been continuously working on a deep technology overhaul to switch from a closed and monolithic system to an open and decoupled one. We split Mercado Libre into many small \u201ccells\u201d. A cell is a functional unit with its own team, hardware, data and source code. Cells interact with each other using Application Programming Interfaces, or API\u2019s. All the Front-Ends are also being rewritten on top of these APIs. This effort has consumed a large amount of capital, people and management\u2019s focus, and we intend to keep investing in this area. In October 2012, we opened our platform to the developer community during a launch event in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We seek to further open our platform to developers in the other locations in which we operate, with the objective of continuing to enhance our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to product development in the future as we add new features and functionality to our services. The market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing and disruptive technologies, evolving industry and regulatory standards, frequent new service and product announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands. Accordingly, we believe the cornerstone of our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services to evolving industry and regulatory standards and to continually improve the performance, features, user experience and reliability of our services in response to competitive product and service offerings and evolving demands of the marketplace.\nSeasonality\nLike most retail businesses, we experience the effects of seasonality in all our operating territories throughout the calendar year. Although much of our seasonality is due to the Christmas holiday season, the geographic diversity of our operations helps mitigate the seasonality attributed to summer vacation time (i.e. southern and northern hemispheres) and national holidays.\nTypically, the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in transactions before the Christmas season (see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Seasonality\u201d for more detail). The first quarter of the year is generally our slowest period. The months of January, February and March correspond to summer vacation time in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. Additionally, the Easter holiday falls in March or April, and Brazil celebrates Carnival for one week in February or March. This first quarter seasonality is partially mitigated by our operations in the countries located in the northern hemisphere, such as Colombia and Mexico, the slowest months for which are the summer months of July, August and September. Lastly, commercial campaigns like Black Friday and Cyber Monday generate an increase in transactions.\nCompetition\nThe online commerce market is rapidly evolving and is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify even further in the future. Barriers-to-entry for large, well-established Internet companies are relatively low, and current and new competitors can launch new sites at a relatively low cost using commercially available software. While we are currently a market leader in a number of the markets in which we operate, we currently or potentially could compete with marketplace operators, businesses that offer business-to-consumer online e-commerce services or others with a focus on specific vertical categories, as well as a growing number of brick and mortar retailers that have launched online offerings. Over the past few years, we have seen competition intensify not only as local players such as B2W or Magazine Luiza grow their ecommerce businesses, but also from international players such as Amazon which has been operating in Mexico since 2015 and more recently launched and expanded its online retailing business in Brazil.\nIn the classifieds advertising market, we compete with regional and local players with general or verticalized focus. In addition, we face competition from a number of large online communities and services that have expertise in developing e-commerce, facilitating online interaction, or both. Other large companies with strong brand recognition and experience in e-commerce, such as large newspapers or media companies, also compete in the online listing market in Latin America.\nMercado Pago competes with existing online and offline payment methods, including banks and other providers of traditional payment methods. Mercado Pago also competes in the rapidly evolving FinTech space with local and strong global players that are becoming increasingly interested in Latin America.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property rights, such as, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and trade secrets as critical to our future success and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and certain contractors. We have also established non-disclosure agreements with our employees, strategic partners and some suppliers in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.\nIn particular, we pursue the registration of our trademarks in each country in which we operate as well as in the United States, in the European Union, in China and in certain other strategic countries.\nAs part of our acquisition of certain subsidiaries of DeRemate.com Inc. (or \u201cDeRemate\u201d) and Classified Media Group, Inc. (or \u201cCMG\u201d), we acquired the trademarks of DeRemate and CMG, respectively, throughout the countries where they operated as well as certain other jurisdictions. We also own trademarks of Autoplaza.com.mx and Homeshop.com.mx in Mexico. Additionally, we operate online classified advertisements platforms dedicated to the sale of real estate in Chile through the Portal Inmobiliario brand and in Mexico through the Metros C\u00fabicos brand. In 2015, we acquired Metros C\u00fabicos (merged into MercadoLibre, S. de R.L. de C.V. since December 2016), company dedicated to the sale of real estate in Mexico, and KPL Solu\u00e7\u00f5es Ltda. (merged into Ebazar since August 2015), a company that develops ERP software for the e-commerce industry in Brazil, owners of Metros Cubicos and KPL trademarks, respectively. During 2016, we acquired Axado, a company that develops logistic software for the e-commerce industry in Brazil, owner of Axado trademark. Finally, in 2017 we acquired Ecommet Software Ltda., owner of the trademarks \u201cEcommet\u201d and \u201cBecommerce\u201d, which is a company that develops e-commerce related software and provides consulting services related thereto in Brazil.\nWe have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our licensees maintain the quality of the Mercado Libre brand, our licensees may take actions that could materially adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or reputation.\nThird parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights by the content listing or the products offered on Mercado Libre. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \u201cItem 1A. Risk factors-Risks related to our business-We could face legal and financial liability for the sale of items that infringe on the intellectual property and distribution rights of others and for information and material disseminated through our platforms\u201d below. Additionally, we provide intellectual property rights owners with resources through our Brand Protection Program, to enforce their rights against questionable listings.\nEmployees\nThe following table shows the number of our employees by country at December 31, 2019:\nWe manage operations in the remaining countries in which we have operations remotely from our headquarters in Argentina.\nOur employees in Brazil are represented by an Information Technology Companies Labor Union in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (\u201cSindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Empresas e Cursos de Inform\u00e1tica do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\u201d), some of our employees in Argentina are represented by the Commercial Labor Union (\u201cSindicato de Empleados de Comercio\u201d) and our fulfillment employees in Argentina are represented by \u201cSindicato de Carga y Descarga\u201d and some of our employees in Uruguay are represented by the Commercial Labor Union (\u201cFederaci\u00f3n Uruguaya de Empleados de Comercio y Servicios\u201d). Unions or local regulations in other countries could also require that employees be represented. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and we implement a variety of human resources practices, programs and policies that are designed to hire, develop, compensate and retain our employees.\nWe are very proud of our employees and believe that our team is one of the most important assets of our Company. We believe that our employees are among the most knowledgeable in the Latin American high tech industry, and they have developed a deep understanding of our business and e-commerce in general. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining outstanding individuals over the years. Similarly, our future success will depend on our ability to continue to attract, develop and retain capable professionals. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks related to our business- We depend on key personnel, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\u201d\nGovernment regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws, decrees and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet in some of the countries where we operate related to e-commerce, electronic payments, privacy, data protection, taxation (including value added taxes (\u201cVAT\u201d), or sales tax collection obligations), obligations to provide information to certain authorities about transactions occurring on our platform or about our users, anti money laundering regulations, transport regulations and other legislation which also applies to other companies conducting business in general. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as general commercial activities, property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel and defamation, obscenity, consumer protection, digital signatures and personal privacy apply to online businesses. Some of these laws were adopted before the Internet was available and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet. Due to these areas of legal uncertainty, and the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services. These regulations could cover a wide variety of issues, including, without limitation, online commerce, Internet service providers\u2019 responsibility for third party content hosted in their servers, user privacy, electronic or mobile payments, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation (including VAT or sales tax collection obligations, obligation to provide certain information about transactions that occurred through our platform, or about our users), advertising, intellectual property rights, consumer protection and information security.\nOur Mercado Pago service is subject to regulation in the countries in which we operate, as described below:\nBrazil\nSince 2013, we are subject to obligations in Brazil imposed on certain payment processing functions carried out by non-financial institutions. On November 1, 2018 we obtained the approval from the Central Bank of Brazil to operate as authorized payment institution, pursuant to its regulations and controls. The approval confirmed our ability to continue carrying out the payment processing functions.\nWith the Authorization, Mercado Pago in Brazil is subject to the supervision of the Central Bank of Brazil and must fully comply with all the obligations established in the current regulation, under penalty of (i) formal warning establishing a deadline for the remediation of non-compliance activity, (ii) pay penalties for non-compliance, or (iii) shut down our Mercado Pago business in Brazil for an indefinite period of time, which would be costly.\nIn November 2018, MercadoLibre, Inc., in accordance with Resoution 4.222, issued by the National Monetary Council (\u201cCMN\u201d), and Circulars 3.649 and 3.317, issued by the Central Bank of Brazil, filed with the Central Bank of Brazil an application for authorization to incorporate a financial institution in the modality of savings and loan associations (\u201cSociedade de Cr\u00e9dito Financiamento e Investimento - SCFI\u201d), to be controlled by us. The purpose of this new company (which will be a financial institution in Brazil) will be to operate the activities related to the granting of Mercado Credito loans in a more efficient way and obtain better funding alternatives for the business. Currently, Mercado Credito loans in Brazil are carried out through correspondent banking agreements with partner financial institutions, since the direct provision of loans is restricted to financial institutions.\nColombia\nDuring 2014 and 2015, Colombia enacted regulations which established specific requirements to open accounts and provide certain payment services, as well as policies for cash and risk management. In 2018 Colombia enacted further regulations requiring payment processors such as Mercado Pago to comply with certain security, privacy and anti-money laundering standards.\nUruguay and Peru\nUruguay and Peru have also enacted regulations that cover a wide variety of issues related to electronic payments or e-money, including, among other things, rules related to the requirement to obtain authorization from the relevant authority to operate, offer or provide certain payment services. In September 2016, we obtained the registration of our Uruguayan subsidiary before the Central Bank of Uruguay as an entity entitled to provide services of payments and collections. Thus, on November 1, 2016 Mercado Pago was launched in Uruguay.\nChile\nIn 2017 and 2018, Chile enacted regulations regarding the issuance and operation of payment cards, which could affect Mercado Pago's operations, including authorization to operate, anti-money laundering obligations, capital requirements and reserve funds, operational and security safeguards, among others. We submitted applications to obtain licenses to act as a prepaid card issuer and payment card operator in June and December 2019, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of the regulations mentioned above.\nMexico\nIn 2017, Mexico\u2019s anti-competition regulatory commission began to investigate potential monopolistic practices across the e-commerce industry in an effort to ensure compliance with the Mexican anti-competition statute. As a market leader in the e-commerce industry in Mexico, we are complying fully with any inquries from the commission. We have not been named or implicated individually in any way.\nIn March 2018, Mexico enacted a new law that regulates both crowd-funders as well as providers of wallets and money transmittal services (the \u201cFintech Law\u201d). Under the Fintech Law, institutions that provided the aforementioned services prior to its enactment are required to submitt an application to the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (the Mexican National Banking Commission or the \u201cCNBV\u201d) to obtain a license, and may continue to provide those services while such license application is being procesed. Our Mexican subsidiary submitted an application to obtain such license in September 2019. The application is being currently processed by the CNBV.\nArgentina\nIn January 2020, the Central Bank of Argentina enacted regulations relating to the payments services providers that applies to the FinTech institutions that are not financial institutions but nevertheless, provide payment services in at least one of the processes of the payments system. According to this regulation, payments services providers must register by April 1, 2020, in a new registry of payments services providers created by the Central Bank of Argentina. The regulation sets forth certain specific rules related to (i) the provision of information to users; (ii) keep the funds of the users deposited in a freely available bank account; (iii) allow the users dispose immediately the funds accredited (iv) provide information relating to the business of payments processing.\nWe continue to develop Mercado Pago and, particularly, our peer-to-peer lending business we may need to secure governmental authorizations or licenses or comply with regulations applicable to financial institutions, electronic payments and/or anti-money laundering in the countries where we offer this service. In this regard, since November 2016 the Argentine subsidiary of the Company is registered before the Argentine anti-money laundering authority (\u201cUnidad de Informaci\u00f3n Financiera\u201d) as an entity subject to certain reporting obligations pursuant to anti-money laundering local regulations relating to the issuance of prepaid cards and, for 2020, card aggregator activities.\nThere are laws and regulations that address foreign currency and exchange rates in every country in which we operate. In certain countries where we operate, we need governmental authorization to pay invoices to a foreign supplier or send money abroad due to foreign exchange restrictions. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk factors-Risks related to doing business in Latin America-Local currencies used in the conduct of our business are subject to depreciation, volatility and exchange controls\u201d for more information.\nWe are also the beneficiary of certain tax regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe Argentine Ministry of Economy approved our main Argentina subsidiary as beneficiary of the Argentine Regime to promote the software industry. Benefits of receiving this status include a relief of 60% of total income tax related to software development activities and a 70% relief in payroll taxes related to software development activities. These tax benefits expired on December 31, 2019. A new law was enacted by Argentine government in June 2019 (knowledge-based economy promotional regime) which established new tax benefits as of January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2029 for certain companies that meet specific criteria. On January 20, 2020, a new resolution issued by Argentina\u2019s Ministry of Productive Development suspended the application of the new regime until new provisions are issued. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2-Summary of significant accounting policies-Income taxes.\u201d\nWe are also subject to significant data protection and privacy-related regulations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Further, some jurisdictions in which we operate are considering imposing additional restrictions or regulations.\nIn August 2018, Brazil approved its first comprehensive data protection law (\u201cLei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais\u201d or \u201cLGPD\u201d), which will be applicable from August 2020. In December 2018, the former President of Brazil issued Provisional Measure No. 869/2018 which makes some amended to the LGPD and importantly creates Brazil\u2019s national data protection authority (the \u201cANDP\u201d).\nWe have created a program to oversee the implementation of relevant changes to our business processes, compliance infrastructures and IT systems to reflect the new requirements and comply with LGPD by August 2020.\nSegment and Geographic Information\nFor an analysis of financial information about our segments, see \u201cItem 7.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our stockholders and prospective stockholders. You should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company, our properties and our business.\nRisks related to our business\nOur business depends on the continued growth of online commerce and the availability and reliability of the Internet in Latin America.\nOnline commerce is still a developing market in Latin America. Our future revenues depend substantially on Latin American consumers\u2019 and providers\u2019 widespread acceptance and continued use of the Internet as a way to conduct commerce and to carry out specific financial transactions. For us to grow our user base successfully, more consumers and providers must accept and use new ways of conducting business and exchanging information. The price of personal computers and/or mobile devices and Internet access may limit our potential growth in certain areas or countries with low levels of Internet penetration and/or high levels of poverty. The infrastructure for the Internet in Latin America may not be able to support continued growth in the number of Internet users, their frequency of use or their bandwidth requirements.\nAvailability, transaction speeds, acceptance, interest and use of the Internet are all critical to our growth and services and the occurrence of any one or more the above challenges to Internet usage could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and evolving environment.\nThe e-commerce and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, and digital content and electronic devices industries are relatively new in Latin America, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we expect competition to become more intense in the future. Barriers to entry are relatively low and current offline and new competitors, including small businesses who want to create and promote their own stores or platforms, can easily launch new sites at relatively low cost using software that is commercially available. MercadoLibre\u2019s Marketplace currently competes with a number of companies, including traditional brick and mortar retailers, including a growing number of those that have launched online offerings; online sales and auction services; other small services, including those that serve specialty markets; business-to-consumer online commerce services; and shopping comparison sites located throughout Latin America.\nIn many cases, companies that directly or indirectly compete with us provide Internet access. These competitors include incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and large Internet service providers. Some of these providers may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of customers\u2019 use of our services. For example, they could restrict or prohibit the use of their lines for our services, filter, block or delay the packets containing the data associated with our products, charge increased fees to us or our users for use of their lines to provide our services, or seek to charge us for our customers\u2019 use of our services or receipt of our e-mails. Although we have not identified any providers who intend to take these actions, any interference with our services or higher charges for access to the Internet, could cause us to lose existing users, impair our ability to attract new users, limit our potential expansion and harm our revenue and growth.\nMercado Pago competes with existing online and offline payment methods, including, among others, banks and other providers of financial services, particularly credit and debit cards, checks, money orders, and electronic bank deposits; international and local online payments services; the use of cash, which is often preferred in Latin America; and offline funding alternatives such as cash deposit and money transfer services, person-to-person payment services and mobile card readers. Some of these services may operate at lower commission rates than Mercado Pago\u2019s current rates and, accordingly, we are subject to market pressures with respect to the commissions we charge for Mercado Pago services. Any or all of these companies could create competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services. Competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and create greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services. Established banks and other financial institutions currently offer online payments and those which do not yet provide such a service could quickly and easily develop it, including mobile phone carriers.\nLarger, more well-established and well-financed companies may also acquire, invest in or enter into commercial relationships with competing businesses. Therefore, some of our competitors and potential competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than us, which could adversely affect us.\nOur future success depends on our ability to expand and adapt our operations to meet rapidly changing industry and technology standards in a cost-effective and timely manner. Such efforts to expand places, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources.\nWe plan to continue to expand our operations by expanding our services internationally and developing and promoting new and complementary services. We may not succeed at expanding our operations in a cost-effective or timely manner, and our expansion efforts may not have the same or greater overall market acceptance as our current services. Furthermore, any new business or service that we launch that is not favorably received by users could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands. Similarly, a lack of market acceptance of these services or our inability to generate satisfactory revenues from any expanded services to offset their cost could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must constantly add new hardware, update software, enhance and improve our billing and transaction systems, and add and train new engineering and other personnel to accommodate the increased use of our website and the new products and features we regularly introduce. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increasing complexity and enhancement of our website results in higher costs. Failure to upgrade our technology, features, transaction processing systems, security infrastructure, or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume or the increased complexity of our website could materially harm our business.\nOur revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes. Our failure to grow our transaction-processing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on our website would materially harm our business and our ability to collect revenue.\nFurthermore, we may need to enter into relationships with various strategic partners, websites and other online service providers and other third parties necessary to our business. The increased complexity of managing multiple commercial relationships could lead to execution problems that can affect current and future revenues and operating margins. The expansion of our Mercado Pago business into new countries may also require a close commercial relationship with one or more local banks or other intermediaries, which may prevent, delay or limit the introductions of our services in such countries.\nOur current and planned systems, procedures and controls, personnel and third party relationships may not be adequate to support our future operations. Our failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market in which we operate is rapidly evolving and we may not be able to maintain our profitability.\nAs a result of the emerging nature and related volatility of the markets and economies in the countries in which we compete, the increased variety of services offered on our website and the rapidly evolving nature of our business, it is particularly difficult for us to forecast our revenues or earnings accurately. In addition, we have no backlog and substantially all of our net revenues for each quarter are derived from listing fees, optional feature fees, up-front fees, final value fees, commissions on Mercado Pago payments, finance and interest fees, shipping fees and advertising that are earned during that quarter. Our current and future expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues and are, to a large extent, fixed. We may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny delay or problem with operating or upgrading our existing information technology infrastructure could cause a disruption in our business and adversely impact our financial results.\nOur ability to operate our business on a day-to-day basis largely depends on the efficient operation of our information technology infrastructure and our cloud providers. We have been and are susceptible to hacking into our systems or other security breaches by unauthorized third parties. We are also susceptible to errors in connection with any systems upgrade or migration to a different hardware or software system, errors or incidents of our cloud providers, bugs or other problems for any of the software we use, either developed in-house or provided by third parties.\nMost of our systems for operating the Mercado Libre ecosystem (Mercado Libre, Mercado Pago, Mercado Env\u00edos, etc.) run on public cloud systems, in several locations around the United States to ensure high availability and backup locations. We also run some of our legacy systems on computer hardware located at the facilities of the Cyxtera Datacenters in Sterling, Virginia. These systems (whether over the public cloud or at the datacenter) and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar events.\nThe public cloud provider could also decide to close the facilities. Our disaster recovery plan may not be sufficient. We are working on developing an alternate cloud provider of hosting services but we are in an early stage and our systems are not fully redundant. We may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any errors, defects, disruptions, interruptions, delays or cessation of service could result in significant disruptions to our business that could ultimately be more expensive, time consuming, and resource intensive than anticipated. Defects or disruptions in our technology infrastructure could adversely impact our ability to process transactions on our site or fulfill shipments, which could reduce our revenue, adversely affect our reputation with, or result in the loss of, user and negatively impact our financial results\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Failure to comply with existing and future rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect the operations of one or more of our businesses in those jurisdictions.\nOur business is subject to the laws, rules, regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate, as well as the legal interpretation of such regulations by administrative bodies and the judiciary of those countries. Furthermore, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. The expansion of our business may also result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement, as well as an claims by regulatory agencies and courts that we are required to obtain licenses to engage in certain business activity.\nEnforcement of, failure, or perceived failure to comply with, laws, rules, regulations, policies or licensing requirements could result in criminal or civil lawsuits, penalties, fines, forfeiture of significant assets, an outright or partial restriction on our operations, enforcement in one or more jurisdictions, additional compliance and licensure requirements, and force us to change the way we or our users do business. Any changes in our or our users\u2019 business methods could increase costs or reduce revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items for some locations.\nThe laws, rules, regulations and policies in the markets in which we operate include, but are not limited to, those governing internet regulation, privacy and user data protection, consumer protection, competition, banking, money transfer, domestic and cross-border electronic funds transfer, anti-money laundering, shipping, and the sale, storage and/or transportation of goods and services.\nIn addition, our operations in most of the countries where we operate are subject to risks related to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties.\nInternet Regulation\nMany of the countries where we operate do not have specific laws governing the liability of Internet service providers, such as ourselves, for fraud, intellectual property infringement, by us our third-party users of our services or other illegal activities by third-party users of our services conducted over our platforms.\nExisting laws, decrees and regulations in some of the countries where we operate related to e-commerce, electronic or mobile payments, information requirements for Internet providers, data collection, data protection, privacy, anti-money laundering, taxation (including VAT or sales tax witholdings), obligations to provide certain information to certain authorities about transactions which are processed through our platforms or about our users and those regulations applicable to consumer protection and businesses in general also may not specifically address how they are to be applied to our type of Internet-based operations.This legal uncertainty could negatively affect our clients\u2019 perception and use of our services and could result in significant expense should we have to defend cases in an unclear legal environment. It is also possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nPrivacy and user Data Protection\nWe are subject to laws relating to the collection, use, storage and transfer of personal data about our providers, employees and, principally, our users, especially regarding financial information. Several jurisdictions already have regulations in this area; and others are considering imposing additional restrictions or regulations. We expect this area of regulation to increase both in number and in the level of stringency. The entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union prompted various Latin American countries to start a reform process of their local data protection regimes. Brazil, for instance, has sanctioned a comprehensive data protection regulation mirroring European Union laws. Should we fail to comply with these laws, either by infringing upon the rights of data subjects or in the transfer of personal data, where in many cases the law applies not only to our interactions with third-parties, but also to transfers of information amongst employees of our Company in the course of their work for us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relations, we may be subject to significant penalties and negative publicity, which would adversely affect us.\n\u200e\nConsumer Protection\nGovernment and consumer protection agencies have in the past received a substantial number of complaints about both the Mercado Libre Marketplace and Mercado Pago. These complaints are small as a percentage of our total transactions, but they could become large in aggregate (absolut) numbers over time. From time to time, we are involved in disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our business has expanded. We are likely to receive new inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future, which may lead to actions against us. We have responded to inquiries from regulatory agencies and described our services and operating procedures and have provided requested information. If one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries, we could be subject to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or penalties, or forced to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business, or if during these inquiries any of our processes are found to violate any laws, or to constitute unfair business practices, we could be subject to civil damages, enforcement actions, fines or penalties. Such actions or fines could require us to restructure our business processes in ways that would harm our business and cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCompetition\nWe receive scrutiny from various governmental agencies under competition laws in the countries where we operate. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies or governmental agencies may allege that our actions violate antitrust or competition laws, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Contractual agreements with buyers, sellers, or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust investigations or litigation. Also, our business practices could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust investigations or litigation. Some regulators may perceive our business to have such a degree of market power that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Such claims and investigations, even if without foundation, typically are very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of Management time and effort, and could result in significant judgments against us.\nBanking, Money Transmission and Domestic or Cross-Border Electronic Funds Transfer\nA number of jurisdictions where we operate have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters and/or electronic payments or funds transfers. We believe we do not require a license under the existing statutes of Argentina, Peru and Colombia to operate Mercado Pago in those countries with Mercado Pago\u2019s current legal and business structure. If our operation of Mercado Pago were found to be in violation of money services laws or regulations or any tax regulations, or engaged in an unauthorized banking or financial business, we could be subject to liability, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain countries, or forced to change our business practices or to become a financial entity. Any change to our Mercado Pago business practices that makes the service less attractive to users or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the speed of trade on the Mercado Libre Marketplace, which would further harm our business. Even if we are not forced to change our Mercado Pago business practices, we could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could be very expensive and time consuming, and we cannot assure that we would be able to obtain these licenses in a timely manner or at all.\nWe are already subject to regulation in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, and Uruguay and could be subject in the short term to new regulations in Colombia, which would require us to obtain regulatory authorizations to operate certain services provided by Mercado Pago. The failure to obtain any such authorization, or the loss of the existing authorizations could cause us to (i) shut down our Mercado Pago business in the relevant jurisdiction for an indefinite period of time, which would be costly and time consuming, (ii) pay penalties for non-compliance or face other penalties such as the dismantling of Mercado Pago and/or (iii) limit the services we offer through Mercado Pago in the relevant jurisdiction or change our business practices, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAnti-Money Laundering\nMercado Pago is or may be subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations that prohibit, among other things, its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities or impose obligations to provide certain information about transactions that have occurred in our platform, or about our users. Because laws and regulations differ in each of the jurisdictions where we operate, as we roll-out and adapt Mercado Pago in other countries, additional verification and reporting requirements could apply. These regulations could impose significant costs on us and make it more difficult for new customers to join the Mercado Pago network. Future regulation, may require us to learn more about the identity of our Mercado Pago customers before opening an account, to obtain additional verification of customers and to monitor our customers\u2019 activities more closely. These requirements, as well as any additional restrictions imposed by credit card associations, could raise our Mercado Pago costs significantly and reduce the attractiveness of Mercado Pago. Failure to comply with anti-money laundering laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, and forfeiture of significant assets.\n\u200e\nShipping\nA number of jurisdictions where we operate have enacted legislation regulating shipping services. We believe we are not required to have a license under the existing statutes of Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile to operate Mercado Envios with its current structure. If Mercado Envios were found to be in violation of shipping services laws or regulations, or engaged in an unauthorized shipping business, we could be subject to liability, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain countries, or forced to change our business practices or to become a postal entity. Any change to our Mercado Envios business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the speed of trade on the Mercado Libre Marketplace, which would further harm our business. Even if we are not forced to change our Mercado Envios business practices, we could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could be very expensive and time consuming, and we cannot assure that we would be able to obtain these licenses in a timely manner or at all.\nSale, Storage and/or Transportation of Goods and Services\nLaws specifying the scope of liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users through their online service are currently unsettled in most of the Latin American countries where we operate. We have implemented what we believe to be clear policies that are incorporated in our terms of use that prohibit the sale, storage and/or transport of certain items (both on our platform and/or in our fulfillment centers and/or through third party carriers providing services to Mercado Libre) and have implemented various actions to monitor and exclude unlawful goods and services from our marketplaces. Despite these efforts, we may be unable to prevent our users from exchanging, depositing and/or delivering unlawful goods or services (as applicable), or exchanging goods in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for the unlawful activities of these users.\nMore specifically, we are aware that certain goods, such as alcohol, tobacco, firearms, animals, adult material and other goods that may be subject to regulation by local or national authorities of various jurisdictions have been traded on the Mercado Libre Marketplace. We have at times been and may continue to be subject to fines for certain users\u2019 sales of products that have not been approved by the government. We are also aware that certain goods expressly excluded from our shipping services pursuant to our policies were stored in our fulfillment centers and/or delivered through third-party carriers providing services to Mercado Libre. We cannot provide any assurances that we will successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities that our users carry out on the occasion of the use of our services in the future. If we suffer potential liability for any unlawful activities of our users, we may need to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, which may require, among other things, that we spend substantial resources and/or discontinue certain service offerings. Any costs that we incur as a result of this liability or asserted liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is based on an Internet platform for commercial and financial transactions in which almost all activity depends on our users and is therefore largely outside of our control.\nOur business is mainly dependent on users listing and purchasing items and services on our platform, and using our online financial services. We mostly depend on the commercial and financial activity that our users generate. Except for our incipient first party business, we do not choose which items will be listed, nor do we make pricing or other decisions relating to the products and services bought and sold on our platform. Therefore, the principal drivers of our business are largely outside of our control, and we depend on the continued preference for our online services by millions of individual users.\nWe may be liable for or experience reputational damage from the failure of users of our Marketplace to deliver merchandise or make required payments.\nOur success depends largely upon sellers accurately representing and reliably delivering the listed goods and buyers paying the agreed purchase price. We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, complaints from users who did not receive the purchase price or the goods agreed to be exchanged. While we can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users, we do not have the ability to force users to make payments or deliver goods sold. We also receive complaints from buyers regarding the quality of the goods purchased or the partial or non-delivery of purchased items. We have tried to reduce our liability to buyers for unfulfilled transactions or other claims related to the quality of the purchased goods by offering a free Buyer Protection Program to buyers who meet certain conditions. We may in the future receive additional requests from users requesting reimbursement or threatening legal action against us if we do not reimburse them, the result of which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, we may be liable in Brazil under applicable regulation for fraud committed by sellers and losses incurred by buyers when purchasing items through our platform in Brazil. We have expanded the coverage of our Buyer\u2019s Protection Program and this coverage expansion may impact the number and amount of reimbursements we are required to make. Effective customer service requires significant personnel expense and investment in developing programs and technology infrastructure to help customer service representatives carry out their functions. These expenses, if not managed properly, could significantly impact our profitability. Failure to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers\u2019 confidence.\nAny litigation related to unpaid or undelivered purchases or defective items could be expensive for us, divert Management\u2019s attention and could result in increased costs of doing business. In addition, any negative publicity generated as a result of the fraudulent or deceptive conduct of any of our users could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our brands and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe could face legal and financial liability for the sale of items that infringe on the intellectual property and distribution rights of others and for information and material disseminated through our platforms.\nAlthough our terms of use clearly prohibit the sale of counterfeit items or any items infringing upon third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights on our platform and we have implemented solutions to exclude goods and services that have been determined to violate our term of use, we are not able to detect and remove every item that may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. As a result, we have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, complaints alleging that certain items listed or sold through the Mercado Libre Marketplace or Mercado Shops or using Mercado Pago infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have been active in defending their rights against online companies, including us. We have taken steps to work cooperate with intellectual property rights owners to seek to eliminate allegedly infringing items listed in the Mercado Libre Marketplace. Our user policy prohibits the sale of goods which may infringe third-party intellectual property rights, and we may suspend the account of any user who infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Despite these measures, some rights owners consider our efforts insufficient, and we anticipate that we will continue to receive legal claims from content and intellectual property owners alleging violations of their rights, which could result in substantial monetary awards, penalties or costly injunctions against us.\nIt is also possible that third parties could bring claims against us for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our platforms, particularly materials disseminated by our users. Other online services companies are facing several lawsuits for this type of liability. If we or other online services providers are held liable or potentially liable for information carried on or disseminated through our platforms, we may have to implement measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. Any measures we may need to implement may involve spending substantial resources and/or discontinuing certain services. Any costs that we incur as a result of liability or asserted liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, public attention to liability issues, lawsuits and legislative proposals could impact the growth of Internet usage, and subsequently have a negative impact on our business results.\nFraudulent activity by our users could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the use of services to decrease.\nWe are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity on our platforms by our users. Although we have implemented measures to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activities, combat bad buyer experiences and increase buyer satisfaction, there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to accurately detect, prevent or deter fraud. As our marketplace sales grow, the cost of remediating for fraudulent activity, including customer reimbursements, may materially increase and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, users may perform frauds or potential illegal activities when using any platform we operate which could expose us to civil or criminal liability and could affect our financial performance. Although we have not experienced any material business or reputational harm as a result of fraudulent or potential illegal activities of our users in the past, we cannot rule out the possibility that any of the foregoing may occur causing harm to our business or reputation in the future. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our results of operations and financial conditions could be materially and adversely affected.\nMercado Pago is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including, fraudulent and illicit sales, money laundering, bank fraud and online securities fraud. In addition, Mercado Pago\u2019s service could be subject to unauthorized credit card use, identity theft, break-ins to withdraw account balances, employee fraud or other internal security breaches, and we may be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches. Merchants could also request reimbursement, or stop using Mercado Pago, if they are affected by buyer fraud.\nWe incur losses from claims of customers who did not authorize a purchase, from buyer fraud and from erroneous transmissions. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive, they could result in Mercado Pago losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. If Mercado Pago is unable to accept credit cards, our business will be adversely affected given that credit cards are the most widely used method for funding Mercado Pago accounts. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud on Mercado Pago, such as running card security code (\u201cCSC\u201d) checks in some countries, requiring users to answer personal questions to confirm their identity, requiring users to confirm small debit amounts prior to authorizing high risk transactions, implementing caps on overall spending per users and data mining to detect potentially fraudulent transactions. However, these measures may not be effective against current and new forms of fraud. If these measures do not succeed, excessive charge-backs may arise in the future and our business will be adversely affected.\nOur users may be the target of \u201cphishing\u201d emails or other intrusions that could subject us to investigations or liability.\nOur users have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails that appear to be legitimate emails sent by Mercado Libre or Mercado Pago or by a user of one of our businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or misstates that certain payment was credited in Mercado Pago and request that the recipient send the product sold or send a password or other confidential information. Despite our efforts to mitigate \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails, those activities could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands or discourage use of our websites and increase our costs. We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, claims from users who received spoof emails and sent the product and did not receive the purchase price.\nWe are subject to security breaches or other confidential data theft from our systems, which can adversely affect our reputation and business.\nA significant risk associated with e-commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Currently, the majority of MercadoLibre users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts or debit their bank accounts directly, or use Mercado Pago to pay for their transactions. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers\u2019 personal data, including financial information. We rely on encryption and authentication necessary to provide the security and authentication technology to transmit confidential information securely, including customer credit card numbers and other account information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect customer transaction data.\nThe techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or our customers\u2019 data, to disable or degrade service, or to sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Unauthorized parties have and may continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, among others, hacking into our systems or those of our customers, partners or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, customers, partners, vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure have and may continue to be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers\u2019 personal or proprietary information and card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities.\nActual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches may lead to claims sanctions against us, and may compromise our reputation. We also expect to spend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to address problems caused by breaches. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies, our current insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results or reputation, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. We cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent them will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. In addition, any breaches of network or data security at our customers, partners or vendors could have similar negative effects.\nOur revenues depend substantially on final value fees, up-front fees, fees related to our payment solution and credits business, shipping and advertising fees, and such revenues may decrease if market conditions force us to lower such fees or if we fail to diversify our sources of revenue.\nOur revenues currently depend primarily on final value fees, up-front fees, fees related to our payment solution and credits business and shipping and advertising fees. If market conditions force us to substantially lower our mentioned fees or if we fail to continue to attract new buyers and sellers, and if we are unable to effectively diversify and expand our sources of revenue, our profitability, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected\nWe are subject to consumer trends and could lose revenue if certain items become less popular.\nOur future revenues depend on continued demand for the types of goods that users list on the Mercado Libre Marketplace or pay with Mercado Pago on or off the Mercado Libre Marketplace. The popularity of certain categories of items, such as computer and electronic products, cellular telephones, toys, apparel and sporting goods, among consumers may vary over time due to perceived availability, subjective value, and trends of consumers and society in general. A decline in the demand for or popularity of certain items sold through the Mercado Libre Marketplace without an increase in demand for different items could reduce the overall volume of transactions on our platforms, resulting in reduced revenues.\nIn addition, certain consumer \u201cfads\u201d may temporarily inflate the volume of certain types of items listed on the Mercado Libre Marketplace, placing a significant strain on our infrastructure and transaction capacity. These trends may also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from one quarter to the next.\nManufacturers may limit distribution of their products by dealers, prevent dealers from selling through us or encourage governments to limit e-commerce.\nManufacturers may attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance arrangements to prevent distributors from selling on our websites or on the Internet generally, or at prices that would make our site attractive relative to other alternatives. Increased competition or anti-Internet distribution policies could result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value of our brand. In order to respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among some of our sellers, which could reduce activity on our websites and harm our profitability.\n\u200e\nInventory risk may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results because of seasonality, new product launches, quick changes in product cycles and pricing, defective products, changes in user demand and user spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We strive to predict these trends, as overstocking or understocking products we sell could lead to lower sales, missed opportunities, and excessive markdowns, each of which could have a material impact on our business and operating results. Moreover, once we launch a new product, it may be difficult to determine appropriate product selection, and accurately forecast demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to manage Mercado Pago and Mercado Fondo users\u2019 funds properly would harm our business.\nOur ability to manage and account accurately for Mercado Pago and Mercado Fondo users\u2019 funds requires a high level of internal controls. As Mercado Pago and Mercado Fondo continue to grow, we must strengthen our internal controls accordingly. Mercado Pago and Mercado Fondo\u2019s success requires significant consumer confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain necessary controls or to properly manage customer funds could severely reduce customer use of Mercado Pago and Mercado Fondo.\nWe rely on banks or payment processors to fund transactions, and changes to credit card association fees, rules or practices may adversely affect our business.\nMercado Pago is not currently entitled to belong to or directly access credit and debit card associations. As a result, we must rely on banks or payment processors to process the funding of Mercado Pago transactions and Mercado Libre Marketplace collections, and must pay a fee for this service. From time to time, card associations may increase the interchange fees they charge for each transaction using one of their cards. The card processors of Mercado Pago and the Mercado Libre Marketplace have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. These increased fees increase the operating costs of Mercado Pago, reduce our profit margins from Mercado Pago operations and, to a lesser degree, affect the operating margins of the Mercado Libre Marketplace.\nWe are also required by processors to comply with card association operating rules. The card associations and their member banks set and interpret the card rules. Some of those member banks compete with Mercado Pago. Card companies could adopt new operating rules or re-interpret existing rules that we or Mercado Pago\u2019s processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow. As a result, we could lose our ability to provide Mercado Pago customers the option of using debit or credit cards to fund their payments and MercadoLibre users the option to pay their fees using a debit or credit card. If Mercado Pago were unable to accept credit cards, our Mercado Pago business would be materially adversely affected.\nWe could lose the right to accept credit cards or pay fines if card processors determine that users are using Mercado Pago to engage in illegal or \u201chigh risk\u201d activities or if users generate a large amount of chargebacks. Accordingly, we are continually working to prevent \u201chigh risk\u201d merchants from using Mercado Pago. Additionally, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates to fund our Mercado Pago operations and for that reason our profitability and total payments volume could materially decline.\nThe failure of the financial institutions with which we conduct business may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf the condition of the financial services industry deteriorates or becomes weakened for an extended period of time, any of the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition:\n\uf0b7Disruptions to the capital markets or the banking system may materially adversely affect the value of investments or bank deposits we currently consider safe or liquid. We may be unable to find suitable alternative investments that are safe, liquid, and provide a reasonable return. This could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizons;\n\uf0b7We may be required to increase the installment and financing fees we charge to customers for purchases made in installments or cease offering installment purchases altogether, each of which may result in a lower volume of transactions completed;\n\uf0b7We may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. Due to the nature of our Mercado Pago and Mercado Libre Marketplace businesses, we generate high account receivable, consumer and merchant loan, and consumer credit balances that we typically sell to financial institutions, and accordingly, lack of access to credit or significant changes to the terms of any existing credit, or bank liquidations could cause us to experience severe difficulties; and\n\uf0b7The failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligations to us under credit instruments could jeopardize our ability to rely on and benefit from those instruments. Our ability to replace those instruments on the same or similar terms may be limited under difficult market conditions.\nA rise in interest rates may negatively affect our Mercado Pago payment volume.\nIn each of Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay and Peru we offer users the ability to pay for goods purchased in installments using Mercado Pago. In 2019 and 2018, installment payments represented 51.8% and 66.5%, respectively, of Mercado Pago\u2019s total payment volume. To facilitate the offer of the installment payment feature, we pay interest to discount credit card coupons or we securitize credit card coupons through trusts. In all of these cases, if interest rates increase, we may have to raise the installment fees we charge to users which would likely have a negative effect on Mercado Pago\u2019s total payment volume.\nChanges in Mercado Pago\u2019s funding mix could adversely affect Mercado Pago\u2019s results.\nMercado Pago pays significant transaction fees when customers fund payment transactions using certain credit cards, PagoMisCuentas and Pago F\u00e1cil, nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions from their bank accounts in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing Mercado Pago account balance. Senders funded 71.3% and 72.8% of Mercado Pago\u2019s payment volume using credit cards during 2019 and 2018, respectively (either in a single payment or in installments), and Mercado Pago\u2019s financial success will remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards. Customers may prefer credit card funding rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons, including the ability to pay in installments in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, the ability to dispute and reverse charges if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described, the ability to earn frequent flyer miles or other incentives offered by credit cards, the ability to defer payment, or a reluctance to provide bank account information to us. Also, in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, senders may prefer to pay by credit card without using installments to avoid the associated financial costs resulting in lower revenues to us.\nChanges in Mercado Pago\u2019s ticket mix could adversely affect Mercado Pago\u2019s results.\nThe transaction fees Mercado Pago pays in connection with certain payment methods are fixed regardless of the ticket price, and certain costs incurred in connection with the processing of credit card transactions are also fixed. Currently, Mercado Pago charges a fee calculated as a percentage of each transaction. If Mercado Pago receives a larger percentage of low ticket transactions, our profit margin may erode, or we may need to raise prices, which, in turn, may affect the volume of transactions.\nOur Mercado Credito solution exposes us to additional risks.\nOur Mercado Credito solution is offered to certain merchants and consumers, and the financial success of this product depends on the effective management of the credit related risk. To assess the credit risk of a merchant and/or consumer seeking a loan under the Mercado Credito solution, we use, among other indicators, a risk model internally developed, as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchants and/or consumer\u2019s ability to repay the principal balance and interest related to the credit. This risk model may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a merchant and/or consumer due to inaccurate assumptions about the particular merchant and/or consumer or the economic environment or limited product history, among other factors. The accuracy of the risk model and our ability to manage credit risk related to our Mercado Credito solution may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes (e.g., bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations), competitors\u2019 actions, changes in consumer behavior, obtain funding resources, changes in the economic environment and other factors.\nLike other businesses with significant exposure to credit losses, we face the risk that Mercado Credito merchants and consumers will default on their payment obligations, making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential charge-offs.\nThe funding and growth of our Mercado Credito business is directly related to interest rates; a rise in interest rates may negatively affect our Mercado Credito business and results of operations.\nWe face significant risks related to our logistics network.\nIn Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile, we offer users our Mercado Envios shipping service through integration with local carriers. To achieve economies of scale, drive down shipping costs and eliminate friction for buyers and sellers, we generally pay local carriers directly for their shipping costs, and then we decide how much of those costs we transfer to our customers. If shipping costs increase, we may have to raise the shipping fees we charge to users which may have a negative effect on Mercado Envios\u2019s shipping volume.\nIf we cannot pass on these increased fees to our customers, the resulting increase in operating costs of Mercado Envios could generate net losses in our Enhanced Marketplace operations.\nWe rely on local carriers to develop our shipping service.\nIf the services of local carriers are not available to us because of unfavorable contractual or commercial terms or for any other reason (i.e. trackers\u2019 strike), we could lose our ability to provide shipping services to our customers, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our shipping service, operating results, and financial condition.\n\u200e\nFailure to successfully operate our fulfillment network may also negatively affect our business.\nThrough our logistics solution, Mercado Envios, we offer sellers on our platform fulfillment and warehousing services. If we do not adequately estimate customer demand to operate our fulfillment network successfully, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment capacity or result in increased costs. As we continue to add fulfillment centers, our fulfillment network may become more complex, and the operation of such centers may present significant challenges. Further, in connection with our fulfillment network service, we maintain the inventory of third parties that sell products through our platform, which increases the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to accurately forecast customer demand and properly handle inventory could result in unexpected costs and materially adversely affect our reputation or results of operations. Moreover, our ability to receive the inventory of third parties efficiently and ship orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events which could have a material adverse effect on our shipping service, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. We could potentially face claims alleging that our technologies infringe the property rights of others.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property rights as critical to our future success and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and certain contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and certain suppliers and strategic partners in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot assure you that these contractual arrangements or the other steps that we have taken or will take in the future to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology, prevent counterfeit sale of our products, or deter independent third-parties from developing similar or competing technologies.\nWe pursue the registration of our intangible assets in each country where we operate, in the United States and in certain other countries worldwide. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available or granted to us by the appropriate regulatory authority in every country in which our services are made available online. We cannot assure you that we will always succeed in obtaining the intellectual property protection we need. If we are not successful, MercadoLibre\u2019s ability to protect its brands in against third-party infringers would be compromised and we could face claims by any future trademark owners. Any claims relating to these issues, whether meritorious or not, could cause us to enter into costly royalty and/or licensing agreements. If any of these claims against us are successful we may also have to modify our brand name in certain countries. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our licensees maintain the quality of the Mercado Libre brand, our licensees may take actions that could affect the value of our proprietary rights or reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo date, we have not been notified that our technology or products infringes on the proprietary rights of third parties, but third parties may claim infringement on our part with respect to past, current or future technologies or features of our services or of our products. We expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in the e-commerce segment grows. Any of these claims could be expensive and time consuming to litigate or settle and could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to secure licenses for technologies on which we rely.\nWe rely on certain technologies that we license from third parties that supply key database technology, operating system and specific hardware components for our services. We cannot assure you that these technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. If we were not able to make use of this technology, we would need to obtain substitute technology that may be of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with these service providers on acceptable terms, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so in the future.\nProblems that affect our service providers could potentially adversely affect us as well.\nA number of parties provide services to us or to our users. These services include the hosting of our servers, shipping and the postal and payments infrastructures that allow users to deliver and pay for goods and services, in addition to paying their Mercado Libre Marketplace bills. Financial, regulatory, or other problems that might prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions on our websites more difficult, which would harm our business. Any security breach at one of these companies could also affect our customers and harm our business.\nWe may not realize benefits from recent or future strategic acquisitions of businesses, technologies, services or products despite their costs in cash and dilution to our stockholders.\nWe intend to continue to acquire businesses, technologies, services or products, as appropriate opportunities arise. We may not, however, be able to identify, negotiate or finance such future acquisitions successfully or at favorable valuations, or to effectively integrate these acquisitions with our current business. The process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into our business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Moreover, future acquisitions may also generate unforeseen pressures and/or strains on our organizational culture.\nAcquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If debt financing for potential future acquisitions is unavailable, we may determine to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock in connection with such an acquisition and any such issuance could result in the dilution of our common stock.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur performance depends substantially on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our ability to retain and motivate these and other officers and employees is fundamental to our performance.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract and retain sufficiently qualified personnel.\nWe may have inadequate business insurance coverage, which would require us to spend significant resources in the event of a disruption of our services or other contingency.\nEven though we have business insurance coverage to face a disruption of our services, it may be inadequate to compensate for our losses. Any business disruption, litigation, system failure or natural disaster may cause us to incur substantial costs and divert resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nRisks related to doing business in Latin America\nThe success of other e-commerce companies is not an indication of our future financial performance, in part because of the markets in which we operate.\nSeveral companies that operate e-commerce websites have been successful and profitable in the past. However, we operate in a business environment in Latin America that is different than the environment in which other e-commerce companies operate. These differences include the smaller size of the national markets, lower Internet adoption rates, lower confidence in remote payment mechanisms, less reliable postal and parcel services, and less predictable political, economic regulatory and legal environments. You should not interpret the success of any of these companies as indicative of our financial prospects.\nWe face the risk of political and economic crises, instability, terrorism, civil strife, labor conflicts, expropriation and other risks of doing business in emerging markets.\nWe conduct our operations in emerging market countries in Latin America. Economic and political developments in these countries, including future economic changes or crises (such as inflation, currency devaluation or recession), government deadlock, political instability, terrorism, civil strife, changes in laws and regulations, labor conflicts, expropriation or nationalization of property, and exchange controls could impact our operations or the market value of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur employees in Brazil and some of our employees in Argentina and Uruguay are currently represented by a labor union and employees in other Latin American countries may eventually become unionized. We may incur increased payroll costs and reduced flexibility under labor regulations if unionization in other countries were to occur, any of which may negatively impact our business. In addition, we could be affected by conflicts between unions which claim representation of our employees that could generate additional payroll costs and labor conflicts.\nAlthough economic conditions may differ from one country to another, we cannot assure you that events in one country alone will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or the market value of our common stock.\nLatin American governments have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over the economies of the countries where we operate. This involvement, as well as political and economic conditions, could adversely affect our business.\nGovernments in Latin America frequently intervene in the economies of their respective countries and occasionally make significant changes in policy and regulations. Governmental actions to control inflation and other policies and regulations have often involved, among other measures, price controls, currency devaluations, capital controls and limits on imports. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected by changes in government policies or regulations, including such factors as: exchange rates and exchange control policies; inflation rates; interest rates; tariff and inflation control policies; price control policies; import duties and restrictions; liquidity of domestic capital and lending markets; electricity rationing; tax policies, including royalty, tax increases and retroactive tax claims; and other political, diplomatic, social and economic developments in or affecting the countries where we operate. Controls and any future changes to the legal and regulatory framework of the countries in which we operate, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReduced foreign investment in any of the countries where we operate may have a negative impact on such country\u2019s economy, affecting interest rates and the ability of companies such as ours to access financial markets.\nLatin America has experienced adverse economic conditions.\nLatin American countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and economic instability. Currently, as a consequence of adverse economic conditions in global markets and lower commodity prices and demand for commodities, many Latin American economies have slow rates of growth, and some have entered recessions. The duration and severity of this slowdown is hard to predict and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, certain countries have experienced or are currently experiencing severe economic crises, which may still have future effects.\nLocal currencies used in the conduct of our business are subject to depreciation, volatility and exchange controls.\nThe currencies of many countries in Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, which together accounted for 95.5% and 93.9% of our net revenues for 2019 and 2018, respectively, have experienced volatility in the past. Currency movements, as well as higher interest rates, have materially and adversely affected the economies of many Latin American countries, including countries which account, or are expected to account, for a significant portion of our revenues. The depreciation of local currencies creates inflationary pressures that may have an adverse effect on us and generally restricts access to the international capital markets. For example, the devaluation of the Argentine Peso has had a negative impact on the ability of Argentine businesses to service their foreign currency denominated liabilities, led to high inflation, significantly reduced real wages, had a negative impact on businesses whose success is dependent on domestic market demand, and adversely affected the government\u2019s ability to service its foreign debt obligations. On the other hand, the appreciation of local currencies against the U.S. dollar may lead to the deterioration of public accounts and the balance of payments of the countries where we operate, and may reduce export growth in those countries.\nCertain of our subsidiaries may be subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict their ability to convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. In Argentina, distribution of dividends abroad is allowed under certain limits and as long as certain requirements are met. In addition, Brazilian law provides that whenever there is a serious imbalance in Brazil\u2019s balance of payments or reason to foresee a serious imbalance, the Brazilian government may impose temporary restrictions on the remittance to foreign investors of the proceeds of their investments in Brazil.\nExchange controls implemented by the Argentine Government on the acquisition of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies could have a material adverse impact on our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations\nThe Argentine government has implemented certain measures that control and restrict the ability of companies and individuals to exchange Argentine Pesos for foreign currencies. Those measures include, among other things, the requirement to obtain the prior approval from the Argentine Central Bank, which could eventually restrict the ability to exchange Argentine pesos for other currencies, such as U.S. dollars. Moreover, restrictions also currently apply to the acquisition of any foreign currency for holding as cash within Argentina. Additionally, the Argentine government implemented a new tax with a rate of 30% on certain transactions involving the acquisition of foreign currency.\nThere can be no assurance that the Central Bank of Argentina or other government agencies will not increase such controls or restrictions, make modifications to these regulations or establish more severe restrictions on currency exchange, which could affect the ability to make payments to foreign creditors or providers and dividend payments to foreign shareholders. These exchange controls and restrictions could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our Argentine subsidiary and could significantly impact our ability to comply our foreign currency obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar but our revenues are generated in the currencies of each country where we operate. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to these foreign currencies, the economic value of our revenues in U.S. dollar terms will decline.\nBecause we conduct our business outside the United States and receive almost all of our revenues in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, but report our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies of certain countries where we operate, including most notably Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, have historically experienced significant devaluations. The results of operations in the countries where we operate are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, as has occurred in some years, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies of countries in which we operate. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 63.6% of our net revenues were denominated in Brazilian Reais, 19.9% in Argentine Pesos and 12.0% in Mexican Pesos.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition are particularly sensitive to adverse developments in the Argentine economy.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are particularly sensitive to business and economic conditions in Argentina. A significant part of our operations are conducted in Argentina, where our costs are incurred, for the most part, in Argentine Pesos.\nIn recent years, Argentina\u2019s foreign debt rating has been downgraded on multiple occasions based on concerns regarding economic conditions and rising fears of increased inflationary pressures. This uncertainty may also adversely impact Argentina\u2019s ability to attract capital.\nThe increasing level of inflation in Argentina has generated pressure for further depreciation of the Argentine Peso, which depreciated against the U.S. dollar by an approximately average of 41.1% in 2018 and 41.7% in 2019. If the current Argentine government is unable to address Argentina\u2019s structural inflationary imbalances, the prevailing high rates of inflation may continue, which would have an adverse effect on Argentina\u2019s economy.\nInflation in Argentina could increase our costs of operations and impact our financial condition and results of operations. Inflation rates may continue to increase in the future, and the effects and effectiveness of government measures to control inflation, adopted presently or in the future, remains uncertain.\nInflation and certain government measures to curb inflation may have adverse effects on the economies of the countries where we operate, our business and our operations.\nMost Latin American countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation. Inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of Latin American countries. Governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation, coupled with speculation about possible future actions, have contributed to economic uncertainty over the years in most Latin American countries. The Latin American countries where we operate may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation, particularly in Argentina, which was determined to be highly inflationary, we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures. A return to a high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nE-commerce transactions in Latin America may be impeded by the lack of secure payment methods.\nUnlike in the United States, consumers and merchants in Latin America can be held fully liable for credit card and other losses due to third-party fraud. As secure methods of payment for e-commerce transactions have not been widely adopted in Latin America, both consumers and merchants generally have a relatively low confidence level in the integrity of e-commerce transactions. In addition, many banks and other financial institutions have generally been reluctant to give merchants the right to process online transactions due to these concerns about credit card fraud. Unless consumer fraud laws in Latin American countries are modified to protect e-commerce merchants and consumers, and until secure, integrated online payment processing methods are fully implemented across the region, our ability to generate revenues from e-commerce may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nRisks related to our shares\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us, prevent a change of control, and may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our management.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may inhibit a change of control that our board of directors does not approve or changes in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in the entrenchment of current management.\nThese provisions include:\n\uf0b7advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\uf0b7a staggered board of directors;\n\uf0b7limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors other than for cause;\n\uf0b7limitations on the ability of stockholders to own and/or exercise voting power over 20% of our common stock;\n\uf0b7limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal our by-laws;\n\uf0b7the inability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\uf0b7the authority of the board of directors to adopt a stockholder rights plan;\n\uf0b7the authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with any terms that the board of directors determines and additional shares of our common stock; and\n\uf0b7limitations on the ability of certain stockholders to enter into certain business combinations with us, as provided under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nThese provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, and this additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion (organically or through strategic acquisitions), to develop new or enhanced services or products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution and the securities that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fund our expansion, take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures. These inabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nShares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nCertain stockholders or entities controlled by them or their permitted transferees beneficially own shares of our common stock that have not been registered for resale with the SEC. The holders of these restricted shares may sell their shares in the public market from time to time without registering them, subject in the case of our affiliates, to certain limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by regulations promulgated by the SEC. Holders of restricted stock will also have the right to cause us to register the resale of shares of common stock beneficially owned by them.\nIn the future, we may issue securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. The amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.\nIt may be difficult to enforce judgments rendered against us in U.S. courts.\nAlthough we are a Delaware corporation, our subsidiaries and most of our assets are located outside of the U.S. Furthermore, most of our directors and officers and some experts named in this report reside outside the U.S. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the U.S. upon these persons. Moreover, uncertainty exists as to whether courts outside of the U.S. would recognize or enforce judgments rendered against us, our subsidiaries, or the abovementioned persons in U.S. courts and predicated on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, any original or enforcement action in a court outside the U.S. will be subject to compliance with procedural requirements under applicable local law, including the condition that the judgment does not violate the public policy of the applicable jurisdiction.\nRisks related to our convertible senior notes\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2028 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2028 Notes is triggered, holders of 2028 Notes will be entitled to convert the 2028 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2028 Notes, and even though our current intention is to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our common stock (and cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we can decide to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2028 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.",

Please refer to Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail. Data since 2018 and 2019 excludes Venezuelan metrics.\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) neutral measures as a non-GAAP measure.\nThis non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables included in this annual report.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors\u2019 overall understanding of our current financial performance. Specifically, we believe that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.\nThe FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2018 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2019, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The comparative FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2017 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2018, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.\nThe following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n(*) The table above may not total due to rounding.\nThe table above shows an increase in loss from operations on an FX neutral basis, mainly as a result of an Argentine local currency devaluation (of an approximate average 41.7%) as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, which has a strong impact when estimating our Argentine operating expenses on an FX neutral basis.\n(*) The table above may not total due to rounding.\n\u200e",

This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations has been organized to present the following:\n\uf0b7a brief overview of our company;\n\uf0b7a review of our financial presentation and accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies;\n\uf0b7a discussion of our principal trends and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017;\n\uf0b7a discussion of the principal factors that influence our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity;\n\uf0b7a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, a discussion of our capital expenditures and a description of our contractual obligations; and\n\uf0b7a discussion of the market risks that we face.\nFor discussion on results from 2018 compared to 2017, please refer to \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBusiness Overview\nMercadoLibre, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries \u201cus\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is the largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America. Our platform is designed to provide users with a complete portfolio of services to facilitate commercial transactions. We are a market leader in e-commerce in each of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, based on number of unique visitors and page views. We also operate online commerce platforms in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Salvador, Panama, Bolivia, Guatemala and Paraguay.\nThrough our platform, we provide buyers and sellers with a robust environment that fosters the development of a large e-commerce community in Latin America, a region with a population of over 644 million people and with one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration rates in the world. We believe that we offer technological and commercial solutions that address the distinctive cultural and geographic challenges of operating an online commerce platform in Latin America.\nWe offer our users an ecosystem of six integrated e-commerce services: the Mercado Libre Marketplace, the Mercado Pago FinTech solution, the Mercado Envios logistics service, the Mercado Libre advertising solution, the Mercado Libre Classifieds service and the Mercado Shops online webstores solution.\nThe Mercado Libre Marketplace, which we sometimes refer to as our marketplace, is a fully-automated, topically-arranged and user-friendly online commerce platform, which can be accessed through our website and mobile app. This platform enables both businesses and individuals to list merchandise and conduct sales and purchases online.\nMercado Pago is our financial technology (FinTech) solution, designed to facilitate transactions both on and off our marketplaces by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely, easily and promptly send and receive payments online. Outside of our marketplaces, Mercado Pago allows merchants to process transactions via their websites and mobile apps, as well as in their brick-and-mortar stores through QR codes and mobile points of sale (\u201cMPOS\u201d) devices. It also enables users to easily transfer money to each other. Through Mercado Fondo, our asset management product, our users are able to invest the outstanding balance on their Mercado Pago account at competitive rates and in a simple way. Mercado Credito, our lending solution, allows us to finance merchants\u2019 working capital needs and consumers\u2019 purchases.\nTo further enhance our suite of e-commerce services, we launched the Mercado Envios shipping program in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Uruguay. Through Mercado Envios, we offer a cost-efficient way to utilize our existing distribution chain to fulfill sales on our platform. Sellers that opt into the program are able to offer a uniform and seamlessly integrated shipping experience to their buyers at competitive prices. As of December 31, 2019, we also offer free shipping to buyers in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Colombia.\nThrough Mercado Libre Classifieds, our online classified listing service, our users can also list and purchase motor vehicles, real estate and services in the countries where we operate. Classifieds listings differ from Marketplace listings as they only charge optional placement fees and not final value fees. Our classifieds pages are also a major source of traffic to our platform, benefitting both the Enhanced Marketplace and non-Marketplace businesses.\nFurthermore, we developed our Mercado Libre advertising platform to enable businesses to promote their products and services on the Internet. Through this platform, MercadoLibre\u2019s sellers and large advertisers are able to display ads on our webpages.\nAdditionally, through Mercado Shops, our online store solution, users can set-up, manage and promote their own online stores. These stores are hosted by Mercado Libre and offer integration with the rest of the ecosystem, namely our marketplaces and payment services. Users can select between a free model and a subscription-based model for enhanced functionalities and value added services on their store.\nReporting Segments and Geographic Information\nOur segment reporting is based on geography, which is the criterion our Management uses to evaluate our segment performance. Our geographic segments are Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Other Countries (including Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Uruguay and the United States of America). Venezuela was one of our geographic segments until we deconsolidated our Venezuelan operations, effective as of December 1, 2017. Although we discuss long-term trends in our business, it is our policy not to provide earnings guidance in the traditional sense. We believe that uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near-term results difficult. Further, we seek to make decisions focused primarily on the long-term welfare of our company and believe focusing on short-term earnings does not best serve the interests of our stockholders. We believe that execution of key strategic initiatives as well as our expectations for long-term growth in our markets will best create stockholder value.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table.

Please refer to Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\n\u200e\nRecent Developments\n\u200e\n\u200eLaw No. 27,506 (knowledge-based economy promotional regime) interruption in Argentina.\nThe knowledge-based economy promotional regime was suspended on January 20, 2020 through a new resolution issued by Argentina\u2019s Ministry of Productive Development until new rules for the application of the mentioned regime are issued. The Company will analyze whether it will be eligible to benefit from the law and its related tax benefits once the new regulations are issued. Please see note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nRegulation issued by Argentine Central Bank\nIn January 2020, the Central Bank of Argentina enacted regulations relating to payments services providers that applies to the FinTech institutions that are not financial institutions but nevertheless, provide payment services in at least one of the processes of the payments system. According to this regulation, payments services providers must register by April 1, 2020, in a new registry of payments services providers created by the Central Bank of Argentina. The regulation sets forth certain specific rules related to (i) the provision of information to users; (ii) keeping users\u2019 funds deposited in a freely available bank account; (iii) allowing the users dispose immediately the funds accredited and (iv) providing information relating to the business of payments processing.\nIf the regulation had been in force as of December 31, 2019, the amount to be deposited in a freely available bank account would amount to $ 126.9 million.\nCriminal complaint against our chief executive officer and others\nOn February 4, 2020, an Argentine federal prosecutor submitted to an Argentine judge a complaint (denuncia) alleging that certain sales of Argentine government securities, made by a common investment fund that holds balances for Mercado Pago customers, were based on non-public information about the government\u2019s plans to extend the maturities of the securities. The complaint names our chief executive officer, as well as others who are not specifically identified, as having committed criminal fraud against the Argentine federal government. The complaint does not provide any specific evidence or theory to support the allegations. We have been informed that a judge has appointed another prosecutor and an inquiry has been initiated, but no formal charges have been presented.\nDescription of line items\nNet revenues\nWe recognize revenues in each of our four geographical reporting segments. Within each of our segments, the services we provide generally fall into two distinct revenue streams: \u201cEnhanced Marketplace\u201d and \u201cNon-Marketplace\u201d.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated net revenues by revenue stream for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nRevenues from Enhanced Marketplace transactions are mainly generated from final value fees and shipping fees net of the third-party carrier costs.\nFinal value fees represent a percentage of the sale value that is charged to the seller once an item is successfully sold. Shipping revenues are generated when a buyer elects to receive an item through our shipping service net of the third-party carrier costs.\nRevenues for Non-Marketplace services are generated from:\n\uf0b7payment fees;\n\uf0b7classifieds fees;\n\uf0b7ad sales up-front fees; and\n\uf0b7fees from other ancillary businesses.\nNon-Marketplace revenues also come from our Mercado Pago FinTech solution, where we generate payment fees attributable to:\n\uf0b7commissions representing a percentage of the payment volume processed that are charged to sellers in connection with off Marketplace-platform transactions;\n\uf0b7commissions from additional fees we charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our Mercado Pago platform, for transactions that occur either on or off our Marketplace platform;\n\uf0b7commissions from additional fees we charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash;\n\uf0b7interest, cash advances and fees from merchant and consumer credits granted under our Mercado Credito solution; and\n\uf0b7revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products.\nThrough our classifieds offerings for motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, real estate and services, we generate revenues from up-front fees for all classifieds offerings. We charge additional fees to sellers who opt to give their listings greater exposure throughout our websites.\nOur Advertising revenues are generated by selling either display product and/or text link ads throughout our websites.\nWhen more than one service is included in one single arrangement with the same customer, we recognize revenue according to multiple element arrangements accounting, distinguishing between each of the services provided and allocating revenues based on their respective estimated selling prices.\nWe have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who use our platforms. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 5.0% of our net revenues.\nOur Mercado Libre Marketplace is available in 18 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Paraguay), and Mercado Pago is available in 7 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay). Mercado Envios is available in 6 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Uruguay).\nThe functional currency for each country\u2019s operations is the country\u2019s local currency, except for Argentina, where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to Argentina\u2019s status as a highly inflationary economy. See-\u201cCritical accounting policies and estimates-Foreign Currency Translation\u201d included below and Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for highly inflationary economy details. Our net revenues are generated in multiple foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the average monthly exchange rate.\nCost of net revenues\nCost of net revenues primarily includes bank and credit card processing charges for transactions and fees paid with credit cards and other payment methods, fraud prevention fees, certain taxes on revenues, certain taxes on revenues, cost of mobile point of sale products sold, hosting and site operation fees, compensation for customer support personnel, ISP connectivity charges, depreciation and amortization, finance costs mainly related to funding our Mercado Pago business, shipping operating costs (including warehousing costs), carrier and other operation costs.\nOur subsidiaries in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia are subject to certain taxes on revenues which are classified as a cost of net revenues. These taxes represented 8.2%, 9.7% and 8.8% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nProduct and technology development expenses\nOur product and technology development related expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineering and web-development staff, depreciation and amortization costs related to product and technology development, telecommunications costs and payments to third-party suppliers who provide technology maintenance services to us.\nSales and marketing expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to marketing our platforms through online and offline advertising and agreements with portals and search engines, charges related to our buyer protection programs, the salaries of employees involved in these activities, chargebacks related to our Mercado Pago operations, bad debt charges, branding initiatives, marketing activities for our users and depreciation and amortization costs.\nWe carry out the majority of our marketing efforts on the Internet. We enter into agreements with portals, search engines, social networks, ad networks and other sites in order to attract Internet users to the Mercado Libre Marketplace and convert them into registered users and active traders on our platform.\nWe also work intensively on attracting, developing and growing our seller community through our customer support efforts. We have dedicated professionals in most of our operations that work with sellers through trade show participation, seminars and meetings to provide them with important tools and skills to become effective sellers on our platform.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for management and administrative staff, compensation of outside directors, long term retention plan compensation expenses, expenses for legal, audit and other professional services, insurance expenses, office space rental expenses, travel and business expenses, as well as depreciation and amortization costs. Our general and administrative expenses include the costs of the following areas: general management, finance, administration, accounting, legal and human resources.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nDuring 2017, and as a result of the lower U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows expected from the Venezuelan business, and long-lived assets expected use, we concluded that certain real estate investments held in Venezuela, should be impaired. As a consequence, we estimated the fair value of the impaired long-lived assets, and recorded impairment losses of $2.8 million on June 30, 2017, by using the market approach and considering prices for similar assets.\nLoss on deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries\nAs further described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, effective as of December 1, 2017, we determined that we no longer meet the accounting criteria for control of our subsidiaries in Venezuela as a result of Venezuela\u2019s recent selective default determination, restrictive exchange controls, suspension of foreign exchange market and the worsening in Venezuela macroeconomic environment that have significantly impacted the Company\u2019s ability to make key financial decisions with respect to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As a result, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of December 1, 2017, recorded an impairment of its investments in Venezuela, including net assets, intercompany balances and intangible assets and began reporting the results under the cost method of accounting. Since December 1, 2017, and as of December 31, 2019, we no longer include the balances, results of operations and cash flows of the Venezuelan subsidiaries in our audited consolidated financial statements.\nOther income (expenses), net\nOther income (expenses) consists primarily of interest income derived from our investments and cash equivalents, interest expense related to financial liabilities and foreign currency gains or losses.\nIncome tax\nWe are subject to federal and state taxes in the United States, as well as foreign taxes in the multiple jurisdictions where we operate. Our tax obligations consist of current and deferred income taxes incurred in these jurisdictions. We account for income taxes following the liability method of accounting. A valuation allowance is recorded when, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, our income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable, if any (given that in certain jurisdictions we still have net operating loss carry-forwards), plus the change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities during each period.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n(*) The table above may not total due to rounding. No asset tax expense was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nSeasonality\nThe following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the twelve quarters set forth below:\n(*)Net Loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 includes tax valuation allowances charges from Mexican and Colombian segments of $98.8 million.\n(**) The quarter ended December 31, 2017 includes special items charges regarding the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Effective as of December 1, 2017, the Company no longer presents the results of its Venezuelan subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements. Please refer to note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\n(***)The amount incurred in shipping subsidies netted from revenues, when we act as an agent, was $261.2 million, $424.8 million and $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSeasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Typically, the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in terms of revenues in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in transactions before the Christmas season. Our slowest period is typically the first quarter of the year. The months of January, February and March normally correspond to summer vacation time in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. Additionally, the Easter holiday falls in March or April, and Brazil celebrates Carnival for one week in February or March. This is partially mitigated by the countries located in the northern hemisphere, such as Colombia and Mexico for which the slowest months are their summer months of July, August and September.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with our audit committee and our board of directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements. You should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other disclosures included in this report.\nFor an analysis of our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates please refer to Note 2 \u201cSummary of significant accounting policies\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nImpairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life\nWe review long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to its undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired on this basis, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill or indefinite useful life intangible assets are considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nWe recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of $2.8 million on June 30, 2017 relating to certain real estate investments in Venezuela. The carrying amount was adjusted to its estimated fair value by using the market approach and considering prices for similar assets.\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life are reviewed at the end of the year for impairment or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (considering each of our segment as a reporting unit) by comparing the reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of such reporting unit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the income approach. Cash flow projections used were based on financial budgets approved by Management. We use discount rates to each reporting unit in the range of 15.4% to 20.0%. The average discount rate used for 2019 was 17.3%. That rate reflected our estimated weighted average cost of capital. Key drivers in the analysis include Average Selling Price (\u201cASP\u201d), Take Rate defined as marketplace revenues as a percentage of Gross Merchadise Volume (\u201cGMV\u201d), Total Payment Volume Off Platform (\u201cTPV Off\u201d), Off Platform Take Rate defined as off platform revenues as a percentage of TPV Off, Wallet and Point TPV per Payer, Wallet Users over Total Population and Active Point devices. In addition, the analysis includes a business to e-commerce rate, which represents growth of e-commerce as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, Internet penetration rates as well as trends in our market share.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, based on quantitative assessments, we have determined that the fair value of all the reporting units and the intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, are greater than their respective carrying amounts.\nExcept for Venezuelan impairment described above, no impairments were recognized during the reporting periods included in the financial statements set forth in Item 8 as Management\u2019s assessment of each reporting unit fair value exceeds its carrying value.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to impairment of long lived assets and goodwill is critical since it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because: (i) it requires Management to make assumptions about gross merchandise volume growth, total payment volume, total payment transactions, future interest rates, sales and costs; and (ii) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our net income would be material. Management\u2019s assumptions about future sales and future costs require significant judgment.\nAllowances for doubtful accounts, for chargebacks and credit losses.\nWe are exposed to losses due to uncollectable accounts, chargebacks and credits to users. Allowances for these items represent our estimate of future losses based on our historical experience. The allowances for doubtful accounts and for chargebacks are recorded as charges to sales and marketing expenses. Historically, our actual losses have been consistent with our estimated charges. However, future adverse changes to our historical experience for doubtful accounts, loans receivable and chargebacks could have a material impact on our future consolidated statements of income and cash flows.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts, loans receivable and for chargebacks is a critical accounting estimate because it requires Management to make assumptions about future collections and credit analysis.\nLegal contingencies\nIn connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. These estimates are based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances and historical information related to actions filed against the Company at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings,\u201d and in Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we will defend ourselves accordingly. However, even if successful, our defense could be costly and could divert Management\u2019s time. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay material damages or modify our business practices. Any of these consequences could materially harm our business and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncome taxes\nWe are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon taxable income and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws in each jurisdiction and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, including various accruals, allowances, depreciation and amortization. The tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2019, we had a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses and foreign tax credit based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our \u201cIncome tax expense\u201d line in our consolidated statement of income. Please refer to note 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income tax and tax reforms.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2-Summary of significant accounting policies-Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\u201d.\nResults of operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the year ended presented, certain data from our consolidated statements of income. This information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report.\nStatement of income data\n(*) The table above may not total due to rounding.\n(**) Venezuelan result have been deconsolidated since December 1, 2017, therefore, our 2019 and 2018 results do not include Venezuelan segment results.\n(***) The amount incurred in shipping subsidies netted from revenues, when we act as an agent, was $261.2 million, $424.8 million and $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\u200e\n(*) Percentages have been calculated using the whole figures instead of rounding figures. The table above may not total due to rounding.\n(**) Venezuelan result have been deconsolidated since December 1, 2017, therefore, our 2019 and 2018 results do not include Venezuelan segment results.\nPrincipal trends in results of operations\nGross profit margins\nOur gross profit margins are defined by total net revenues minus total cost of net revenues, as a percentage of net revenues.\nOur gross profit margins remained stable at 48.0% and 48.4% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn the future, gross profit margins could decline if we continue to offer free shipping and warehousing services and the penetration of our payment solution and our shipping service grows faster than our marketplace sales.\nOperating (loss)/income margins\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to year ended December 31, 2018, operating loss margin increased from a negative margin of 4.8% to a negative margin of 6.7%. This increase is primarily a consequence of the increase in sales and marketing expenses (mainly related to branding initiatives and bad debt expenses related to credit business in Brazil), calculated as a percentage of net revenues.\nAs we continue to invest in product development, sales and marketing and human resources in order to promote our services and capture the long-term business opportunities, we may experience decreases in operating margins.\n\u200e\nNet revenues\nOur net revenues grew 59.5% in year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in net revenues is mainly attributable to increases in the enhanced marketplace net revenues of 70.7% related to an increase in local currency gross merchandise volume in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico of 83%, 23% and 49%, respectively. In addition, the increase in net revenues was attributable to:\na)a decrease of $163.6 million, or 38.5%, in shipping subsidies that are netted from revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018; and\nb)an increase of $90.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, related to the flat fee we charge for transactions below a certain merchandise value, mainly in Brazil.\nOur non-marketplace revenues increased 48.8%, from $737.3 million for year ended December 31, 2018 to $1,097.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly generated by a 53.8% increase in our total payment volume, mainly associated with off-platform transactions, financing and credits businesses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe increase in our net revenues was partially offset by an average devaluation of the Argentine Peso of approximately 41.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table. The table above may not total due to rounding.\n(**)\nVenezuelan revenues have been deconsolidated since December 1, 2017. Please refer to Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\n(***)\nThe amount incurred in shipping subsidies netted from revenues, when we act as an agent, was $261.2 million, $424.8 million and $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(****)\nIncludes, among other things, payment fees, ad sales, classified fees and other ancillary services.\nOn a segment basis, our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, increased across all geographic segments, except for the Venezuelan segment which was deconsolidated as of December 1, 2017.\nBrazil\nEnhanced Marketplace revenue in Brazil increased 86.1% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily a consequence of: i) a 23% increase in local currency gross merchandise volume; ii) a 159.8 million decrease in shipping subsidies related to our free shipping initiative, which is presented netted from revenues when we act as an agent; and iii) an increase of $83.5 million as a result of the implementation of a flat fee for transactions below a certain merchandise value. Non-Marketplace revenues grew by 54.3%, a $257.1 million increase, during year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly driven by a 124.7% increase in the off-platform payments volume (which is partially monetized as a strategy to expand our ecosystem), financing and credits businesses.\n\u200e\nArgentina\nEnhanced Marketplace revenues in Argentina increased 8.6% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily a consequence of: i) a 83% increase in local currency gross merchandise volume and ii) an increase of $6.9 million as a result of the implementation of a flat fee for transactions below a certain merchandise value. This increase was partially offset by: i) a 41.7% approximately average devaluation of the local currency and ii) an increase of $7.4 million in shipping subsidies related to our free shipping initiative, which is presented netted from revenues when we act as an agent. Non-Marketplace revenues grew 34.7%, a $63.0 million increase, during year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly driven by a 132.8% increase in the off-platform payments volume (which is partially monetized as a strategy to expand our ecosystem), financing and credits businesses, partially offset by the aforementioned devaluation of the local currency.\nMexico\nEnhanced Marketplace revenues in Mexico increased 181.4% in the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to: i) the reduced impact on revenues of shipping costs on revenues related to certain shipping services when we started acting as principal as of November 2018 and ii) a 49% increase in local currency gross merchandise volume. Non-Marketplace revenues grew 91.2%, a $32.3 million increase, during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly driven by increases in the volume of off-platform payments transactions, financing and credit businesses.\nVenezuela\nVenezuelan revenues have been deconsolidated since December 1, 2017. Please refer to Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nThe following table sets forth our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly growth of these net revenues for the periods described below:\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table.\n(**)\nThe amount incurred in shipping subsidies netted from revenues, when we act as an agent, was $261.2 million, $424.8 million and $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(***)\nVenezuelan revenues have been deconsolidated since December 1, 2017.

The table above may not total due to rounding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, the increase of $451.5 million in cost of net revenues was primarily attributable to: i) a $155.5 million increase in shipping carrier and operating costs; ii) an increase in collection fees of $107.6 million, which was mainly attributable to our Argentine and Brazilian operations as a result of the higher transactions volume of Mercado Pago in those countries; iii) a $64.2 million increase in cost of products sold attributable to increased sales of our mobile point of sale devices in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico; iv) a $49.9 million increase in sales taxes, mainly related to the growth of our Argentine and Brazilian operations; v) a $30.6 million increase in finance costs mainly related to funding our Mercado Pago business; and vi) a $21.6 million increase in customer support costs mainly as a consequence of higher salaries and wages due to new hires and temporary customer support workers.\nProduct and technology development\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, the 53.0% increase in product and technology development expenses amounted to $77.5 million and was primarily attributable to: i) a $32.0 million increase in salaries and wages; ii) a $29.2 million increase in other product and technology development expenses primarily related to office expenses and certain tax withholdings; and iii) a $9.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nWe believe product development is one of our key competitive advantages and intend to continue to invest in adding engineers to meet the increasingly sophisticated product expectations of our customer base.\nSales and marketing\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table. The table above may not total due to rounding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the $351.6 million increase in sales and marketing expenses when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to: i) an increase of $189.7 million in online and offline marketing expenses, mainly in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, ii) an increase of $41.2 million in other sales expenses, iii) a $35.1 million increase in chargebacks from credit cards due to the increase in our Mercado Pago transactions volume, iv) a $33.9 million increase in our buyer protection program expenses, mainly in Brazil and Mexico, v) a $31.2 million increase in bad debt expenses mainly related to our credit portfolio; and vi) a $19.1 million increase in salaries and wages.\nGeneral and administrative\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table.

Please refer to Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nOther income (expense), net\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table. The table above may not total due to rounding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the $41.9 million increase in other income/(expenses), net compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily attributable to a $71.5 million increase in interest income from our financial investments as a result of the proceeds of the 2028 Notes and equity offering during 2019, which generated more invested volume and interest gain, and a higher float in Argentina and Mexico. This increase was partially offset by: i) a higher foreign exchange loss of $20.0 million, related to the $18.2 million gain from 2018 compared with the $1.7 million loss from 2019; and ii) an increase of $9.6 million in financial expenses, mainly attributable to interest expense related to 2028 Notes and secured financial loans and interest expenses from our trusts related to our factoring business in Argentina.\nIncome tax\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table. The table above may not total due to rounding.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, income tax (expense)/gain variation was $93.6 million, mainly as a consequence of valuation allowances accounted on certain deferred tax assets in Mexico and Colombia and higher tax deductible expenses on our Argentine business related to tax inflation adjustments, in accordance with Argentine income tax law.\nU.S. and Argentine Tax Reforms\nPlease see Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tax reforms in each jurisdiction in which we operate.\nOur effective tax rate is defined as income tax (expense)/gain as a percentage of (expense)/income before income tax.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nOur effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, decreased to a negative effective tax rate as compared to the same period in 2018, largely as a result of valuation allowances accounted on certain deferred tax assets in Mexico and Colombia and pre-tax losses in 2019.\nThe following table sets forth our effective income tax rate related to our main locations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nThe decrease in the effective income tax rate in our Argentine subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was mainly a consequence of higher tax deductible expenses on our Argentine business related to tax inflation adjustments, in accordance with Argentine income tax law.\nFor information regarding the benefits granted to the Company under the software development law, please see Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statement.\nThe decrease in our Brazilian effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, was mainly related to higher non-taxable pre-tax gains and higher non-deductible expenses during 2019.\nThe decrease in our Mexican effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was mainly related to valuation allowances accounted on certain deferred tax assets in our Mexican business.\nDeferred Income Tax\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018 our deferred tax assets, were comprised mainly of loss carry forwards representing 65.3% and 71.6% of our total deferred tax assets, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our deferred tax assets from loss carryforwards for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nWe also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or the total deferred tax assets will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, our valuation allowance amounted to $138.9 million and $15.7 million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nOur valuation allowance is based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The fluctuations in the valuation allowance will depend on the capacity of each country\u2019s operations to generate taxable income or our execution of future tax planning strategies that allow us to use the aforementioned deferred tax assets. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles.\n\u200e\nSegment information\nSee Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements for detailed description about our reporting segments.\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table.

This increase in direct costs are netted from the effect of inflation and devaluation in Argentina, as described previously in this document.\nMexico\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, direct costs increased by 137.0%, mainly driven by: i) a 206.1% increase in cost of net revenues, mainly attributable to an increase in shipping operating and carrier costs, collection fees due to higher Mercado Pago penetration, customer support costs and cost of products sold as a result of increased sales of our mobile point of sale devices; ii) a 94.4% increase in sales and marketing expenses, mainly due to increases in online and offline marketing expenses and branding initiatives, buyer protection program expenses, chargebacks from credit cards due to the increase in our Mercado Pago transaction volume and salaries and wages; iii) a 89.5% increase in product and technology development expenses, mainly attributable to depreciation and amortization expenses; and iv) a 99.4% increase in general and administrative expenses mainly due to an increase in salaries and wages and other general and administrative expenses.\nVenezuela\nWe deconsolidated our Venezuelan\u2019s operations effective as of December 1, 2017 and recorded an impairment of $85.8 million, of which $76.6 million are included as direct costs, and relates to the company\u2019s investment in Venezuela, including net assets, intangibles accumulated translation differences and $9.1 million are related to intercompany balances. Please refer to note 2 from our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur main cash requirement historically has been working capital to fund Mercado Pago financing operations. We also require cash for capital expenditures relating to technology infrastructure, software applications, office space, business acquisitions, to fund our credit business, to build out our logistics capacity and the interest payments on our 2028 Notes.\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through contributions received from our stockholders during the first two years of operations, funds raised from our initial public offering, and from cash generated from our operations. We issued the 2019 Notes and 2028 Notes for net proceeds of $321.7 million and $864.6 million, respectively. We have funded Mercado Pago mainly by discounting credit card receivables and credit lines.\nAdditionally, we started to fund our Mercado Pago and Mercado Credito businesses through securitization of certain loans and credit cards receivable through SPEs created in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Please refer to Note 20 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further detail on securitization transactions.\nFinally, we issued common and preferred stock in the securities offerings that closed on March 15, 2019 and March 29, 2019, respectively, for net aggregate proceeds of $1,965.9 million, which are intended to be used to fund the growth of our payment initiatives, build out our logistics capacity, drive the adoption of these services and for general corporate purposes. Please see note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our equity offerings\nAs of December 31, 2019, our main source of liquidity, amounting to $2,459.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, which excludes $506.2 million investment related to the Central Bank of Brazil Mandatory Guarantee and $16.6 million investment related to financial guarantees for secured lines of credit in Argentina, and $264.0 million of long-term investments, consists of cash generated from operations, proceeds from loans, from the issuance of the 2028 Notes and proceeds from our issuances of common and preferred stock. We consider our long-term investments as part of our liquidity because long-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities classified as long-term as a consequence of their contractual maturities.\nThe significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, credit cards receivable, loans receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, funds payable to customers, and short-term debt.\nAs of December 31, 2019, cash and investments of our non-U.S. subsidiaries amounted to $1,222.5 million, representing 36.9% of our consolidated cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments and our cash, restricted cash and investments of our non-U.S. subsidiaries held outside U.S. amounted to 33.0% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalent, restricted cash and cash equivalent and investments. Our non-U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalent, restricted cash and cash equivalent and investments are located primarily in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.\n\u200e\nThe following table presents our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table.\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nCash provided by operating activities consists of net (loss)/income adjusted for certain non-cash items, and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities:\nThe\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table.\nThe $220.2 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily driven by a $97.7 million increase as a consequence of lower net loss after non-cash adjustments, a $91.9 increase in funds payable to customers, a $53.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $32.9 million increase on interest received from investment. This increase was partially offset by a $72.0 million decrease in credit cards receivable.\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted mainly from purchases of investments of $4,490.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments of $3,353.6 million, as part of our financial strategy. We used $173.8 million in principal loans receivable granted under our Mercado Credito solution; $136.8 million in the purchase of property and equipment (mainly in information technology and leashold improvements on our offices and fulfillment centers in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil).\n\u200e\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our cash provided by financing activities was primarily derived from $1,867.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock, a $348.1 million increase in payments from the exchange of the 2019 Notes during 2018 and a $98.7 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Stock. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $880.0 million related to funds received from the issuance of the 2028 Notes in August 2018 and a decrease of $136.1 million related to the partial unwinding of the 2019 Notes Capped Call Transactions in 2018.\nIn the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future, we may fund them with available cash, third-party debt financing, or by raising equity capital, as market conditions allow.\nDebt\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn June 30, 2014, we issued $330 million of 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the \u201c2019 Notes\u201d). The 2019 Notes were unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, which paid interest in cash semi-annually, on January 1 and July 1 of each year, at a rate of 2.25% per annum. The 2019 Notes matured on July 1, 2019. Holders of $66.0 million principal amount of the 2019 Notes elected to convert their 2019 Notes at maturity, and we issued 523,407 shares of our common stock and paid $8 thousands in cash (because of the fraction of shares) in settlement of such conversions. $17 thousands of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes was not converted and was repaid by us in cash at maturity.\nOn August 24, 2018, we issued $800 million of 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 and on August 31, 2018 we issued an additional $80 million of notes pursuant to the partial exercise of the initial purchasers\u2019 option to purchase such additional notes, resulting in an aggregate principal amount of $880 million of 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028. The 2028 Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, which pay interest in cash semi-annually, on February 15 and August 15, at a rate of 2.00% per annum. The 2028 Notes will mature on August 15, 2028 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The 2028 Notes may be converted, under specific conditions, based on an initial conversion rate of 2.2553 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $443.40 per share of common stock), subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes.\nAlso, on July 1, 2019, we received and retired 131,994 shares of our Common Stock in settlement of capped call agreements that we had previously entered into in relation to the 2019 Notes.\nPlease refer to Notes 2 and 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the 2019 Notes, the 2028 Notes and the related capped call transactions.\nMercado Pago Funding\nDuring 2019, we, through our subsidiaries, continued obtaining certain lines of credit in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay primarily to fund the Mercado Pago business. Additionally, we continue to securitize certain loans and credit card receivables through our Argentine, Mexican and Brazilian SPEs, formed to securitize loans and credit cards receivable provided by us to our users. Please refer to Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nCash Dividends\nSee \u201cItem 5 - Market for registrant\u2019s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities-Dividend Policy\u201d for more information regarding our dividend distributions.\nOur Board of Directors suspended the payment of dividends on our common stock as of the first quarter of 2018 after reviewed our capital allocation process and concluding that we have multiple investment opportunities that should generate greater returns to shareholders through investing capital into the business as compared to paying dividends. Any future determination as to the declaration of dividends on our common stock will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors, including the applicable requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nCapital expenditures\nOur capital expenditures (composed of our payments for property and equipment, intangible assets and acquired businesses) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $141.4 million and $102.0 million, respectively.\nWe invested $55.3 million and $55.5 million in leasehold improvements in our offices and fulfillment centers in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We also invested $74.0 million and $54.7 million, respectively, in Information Technology, which was concentrated across Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.\nWe are continually increasing our level of investment in hardware and software licenses necessary to improve and update our platform\u2019s technology and our computer software developed internally. We anticipate continued investments in capital expenditures related to information technology in the future as we strive to maintain our position in the Latin American e-commerce market.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the sale of credit card receivables and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, property and equipment expenditures and to pay or repay obligations going forward.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual obligations\nWe have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions and other factors may result in actual payments differing materially from the estimates below. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amount of payments. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 are as follows:\nh\n(*)\nThe table above may not total due to rounding.\n(1)\nIncludes principal and interest amounts. For additional details regarding our loans payable and 2028 Notes, please see Note 15; for collateralized debt securitization and finance and operating lease obligations, please see Note 20 and 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes leases of office space and fulfillment centers.\nWe have leases for office space, fulfillment centers and vehicles in certain countries in which we operate. Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (technological equipment and software licenses) and other goods and services that were entered into in the ordinary course of business. We have developed estimates to project payment obligations based upon historical trends, when available, and our anticipated future obligations. Given the significance of performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements, actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from our business operations. These market risks arise mainly from the possibility that changes in interest rates and the U.S. dollar exchange rate with local currencies, particularly the Brazilian Real and Argentine Peso due to Brazil\u2019s and Argentine\u2019s respective share of our revenues, may affect the value of our financial assets and liabilities.\nWe are also exposed to market risks arising from our long-term retention plans (\u201cLTRPs\u201d). These market risks arise from our obligations to pay employees cash payments in amounts that vary based on the market price of our stock.\nForeign currencies\nAs of December 31, 2019, we hold cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in local currencies in our subsidiaries, and have receivables denominated in local currencies in all of our operations. Our subsidiaries generate revenues and incur most of their expenses in the respective local currencies of the countries in which they operate. As a result, our subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency except for our Argentine subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary environment. As of December 31, 2019, the total cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies totaled $563.4 million, short-term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled $564.6 million and accounts receivable, credit cards receivable and loans receivable in foreign currencies totaled $414.7 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had no long-term investments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage exchange rate risk, our treasury policy is to transfer most cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital requirements into U.S. dollar-denominated accounts in the United States. As of December 31, 2019, our U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1,597.2 million and our U.S. dollar-denominated long-term investments totaled $264.0 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we had a consolidated loss on foreign currency of $1.7 million mainly as a consequence of a $2.5 million loss on foreign exchange in our Brazilian subsidiaries, partially offset by a $0.3 million gain on forex exchange in our Argentina subsidiary. (See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of operations-Other income (expenses), net\u201d for more information).\nPlease see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for further detail on Argentina\u2019s functional currency change.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n(*)\nPercentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table. The table above may not total due to rounding.\n(**)\nThe amount incurred in shipping subsidies netted from revenues, when we act as an agent, was $261.2 million, $424.8 million and $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(***)\nVenezuelan revenues have been deconsolidated since December 1, 2017. Please refer to Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nForeign Currency Sensitivity Analysis\nThe table below shows the impact on our net revenues, expenses, other expenses and income tax, net loss and equity for a positive and a negative 10% fluctuation on all the foreign currencies to which we are exposed to as of December 31, 2019 and for the year then ended:\n(1)\nAppreciation of the subsidiaries local currency against U.S. Dollar\n(2)\nDepreciation of the subsidiaries local currency against U.S. Dollar\n(*)\nThe table above does not total due to rounding.\nThe table above shows an increase in our net loss when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies because of the negative impact of the increase in loss from operations, other income/(expenses) and income tax related to P&L items and the re-measurement of our net asset position in U.S. dollars. On the other hand, the table above shows a decrease in our net loss when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies because of the positive impact of the decrease in loss from operations, other income/(expenses) and income tax related to P&L items and the re-measurement of our net asset position in U.S. dollars.\nDuring 2019, we entered into hedging transactions in Brazil in order to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nArgentine Segment\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have classified our Argentine operations as highly inflationary since July 1, 2018, using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for purposes of reporting our financial statements. Therefore, no translation effect has been accounted for in other comprehensive income related to our Argentine operations since July 1, 2018.\nHad a hypothetical devaluation of 10% of the Argentine Peso against the U.S. dollar occurred on December 31, 2019, the non-functional currency net asset position in our Argentine subsidiaries, before intercompany eliminations, would have recorded a foreign exchange gain amounting to $2.5 million.\nSee Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-Critical accounting policies and estimates-Foreign Currency Translation\u201d for details on the currency status of our Argentine segment.\nBrazilian Segment\nHad a hypothetical devaluation of 10% occurred on December 31, 2019, the reported net assets in our Brazilian subsidiaries, before intercompany eliminations, would have decreased by $52.0 million with the related impact in Other Comprehensive Income. Additionally, we would have recorded a foreign exchange loss amounting to $7.1 million in our Brazilian subsidiaries.\nInterest\nOur earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates. These changes could have an impact on the interest rates that financial institutions charge us prior to the time we sell our credit cards receivable and on the financial debt that we use to fund our Mercado Pago and Mercado Credito\u2019s operations. As of December 31, 2019, Mercado Pago\u2019s funds receivable from credit cards totaled $380.0 million. Interest rate fluctuations could also impact interest earned through our Mercado Credito solution. As of December 31, 2019, loans granted under our Mercado Credito solution totaled $182.1 million. Interest rate fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits, money market funds, investment grade corporate debt securities and sovereign debt securities. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.\nUnder our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2019, the average duration of our available for sale debt securities, defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a 100-basis-point change in yield, was 0.7%. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the fair market value of our available for sale debt securities as of December 31, 2019 could decrease (increase) by $7.8 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our short-term investments amounted to $1,597.2 million and our long-term investments amounted to $264.0 million. These investments, except for the $506.2 million included in short-term investment related to the Central Bank of Brazil Mandatory Guarantee and $16.6 million related to guarantee for secured lines of credit in Argentina, can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur board of directors adopted the 2012 long-term retention plan (the \u201c2012 LTRP\u201d), under which each eligible employee must satisfy the performance conditions established by the Board of Directors for such employee. If these conditions are satisfied, the eligible employee will, subject to his or her continued employment as of each applicable payment date, receive cash awards (\u201cLTRP Awards\u201d), which are payable as follows:\n\uf0b7eligible employees will receive a fixed payment equal to 6.25% of his or her LTRP Award under the 2012 LTRP, once a year for a period of eight years. The 2012 LTRP awards began paying out starting in 2013 (the \u201c2012 Annual Fixed Payment\u201d); and\n\uf0b7on each date we pay the 2012 Annual Fixed Payment to an eligible employee, he or she will also receive a payment (the \u201c2012 Variable Payment\u201d) equal to the product of (i) 6.25% of the applicable 2012 LTRP Award and (ii) the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Applicable Year Stock Price (as defined below) and (b), the denominator, equals the 2011 Stock Price, $77.77, which was the average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the final 60 trading days of 2011. The \u201cApplicable Year Stock Price\u201d equals the average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the final 60 trading days of the year preceding the applicable payment date.\nOur board of directors, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee, approved the 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 Long Term Retention Plan (the \u201c2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 LTRPs\u201d), respectively.\nIn order to receive an award under the 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and/or 2018 LTRP, each eligible employee must satisfy the performance conditions established by the Board of Directors for such employee. If these conditions are satisfied, the eligible employee will, subject to his or her continued employment as of each applicable payment date, receive the full amount of his or her 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and/or 2018 LTRP award, payable as follows:\n\uf0b7the eligible employee will receive a fixed payment, equal to 8.333% of his or her 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and/or 2018 LTRP bonus once a year for a period of six years starting in March 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and/or 2019 respectively (the \u201c2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, or 2018 Annual Fixed Payment\u201d, respectively); and\n\uf0b7on each date we pay the respective Annual Fixed Payment to an eligible employee, he or she will also receive a payment (the \u201c2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, or 2018 Variable Payment\u201d, respectively) equal to the product of (i) 8.333% of the applicable 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and/or 2018 LTRP award and (ii) the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Applicable Year Stock Price (as defined below) and (b), the denominator, equals the 2013 (with respect to the 2014 LTRP), 2014 (with respect to the 2015 LTRP), 2015 (with respect to the 2016 LTRP), 2016 (with respect to the 2017 LTRP) and 2017 (with respect to the 2018 LTRP) Stock Price, defined as $118.48, $127.29, $111.02, $164.17 and $270.84 for the 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 LTRP, respectively, which was the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the final 60 trading days of 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The \u201cApplicable Year Stock Price\u201d shall equal the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the final 60 trading days of the year preceding the applicable payment date.\nOur board of directors, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee, approved the 2019 Long Term Retention Program (the \u201c2019 LTRP\u201d), under which certain eligible employees have the opportunity to receive cash payments annually for a period of six years (with the first payment occurring during the first quarter of 2020). In order to receive the full target award under the 2019 LTRP, each eligible employee must remain employed as of each applicable payment date. The 2019 LTRP award is payable as follows:\n\uf0b7the eligible employee will receive 16.66% of half of his or her target 2019 LTRP bonus once a year for a period of six years, with the first payment occurring during the first quarter of 2020 (the \u201c2019 Annual Fixed Payment\u201d); and\n\uf0b7on each date we pay the 2019 Annual Fixed Payment to an eligible employee, he or she will also receive a payment (the \u201c2019 Variable Payment\u201d) equal to the product of (i) 16.66 % of half of the target 2019 LTRP award and (ii) the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Applicable Year Stock Price (as defined below) and (b), the denominator, equals the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the final 60 trading days of 2018 defined as $322.91 for the 2019 LTRP. The \u201cApplicable Year Stock Price\u201d shall equal the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the final 60 trading days of the year preceding the applicable payment date.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total contractual obligation fair value of our outstanding LTRP Variable Award Payment obligation amounted to $124.2 million. As of December 31, 2019, the accrued liability related to the outstanding Variable Award Payment of the LTRP included in Salaries and Social security payable in our consolidated balance sheet amounted to $61.0 million.

    "item_9A": "ITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on the evaluation of our disclosure control and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to Management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nOur Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework updated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Management\u2019s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), our Management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of Management\u2019s assessment with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Deloitte & Co. S.A., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.",

The Amended and Restated 2009 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to our employees and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and other equity-based or equity-related awards to our employees, directors, officers and managers. Incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options are referred to as \u201cstock options,\u201d and together with restricted stock and all other awards are referred to as \u201cawards\u201d. As of December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding stock options to purchase shares of common stock under the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan.\nNo stock options were granted during the period from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2019 and there were no stock-based compensation expenses related to stock options for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. There is no stock option award outstanding under the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, there were 1,000,000 shares of common stock available for additional awards under the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan.\nNumber of shares of common stock available under the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan. The maximum number of common stock reserved and available for delivery in connection with awards under the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan is 1,000,000 Shares of common stock underlying awards previously granted under the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan that terminate without being exercised, expire, are forfeited or canceled shall again be available pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan. The shares of common stock issuable pursuant to any award granted under the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan shall be (i) authorized but unissued shares, (ii) shares of common stock held in the Corporation\u2019s treasury, (iii) shares acquired by the Corporation on any stock exchange in which such shares are traded, or (iv) a combination of the foregoing.\nAdministration of the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan. The Amended and Restated 2009 Plan is administered by our board of directors or a committee appointed by the board of directors (the body in charge of administering the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan is referred to as the \u201cadministrator\u201d). If the common stock is registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the board of directors shall consider in selecting the administrator and the membership of any committee acting as administrator the provisions of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act regarding \u201cnon-employee directors.\u201d The administrator determines the recipients of awards, the times at which awards are granted, the number of shares subject to each type of award, the time for vesting of each award and the duration of the exercise period for stock options. The administrator additionally has the power and authority to approve forms of award agreements and other related documents used under the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan.\nPrice, exercise and termination of stock option awards . The exercise price for each share of common stock subject to a stock option is determined by the administrator, and in no event shall the exercise price be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of the grant (or 110% in the case of employees who directly or indirectly own more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock).\nStock options are exercisable on their vesting date, which is determined by the administrator and set forth in the award agreement governing any particular stock option. Vesting dates can be accelerated on the occurrence of a specified event, as provided in an award agreement, or can be accelerated at the discretion of the administrator.\nIf a stock option expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised, it shall become null and void and of no further force and effect. The term of a stock option may not exceed beyond the tenth anniversary on which the stock option is granted (or the fifth anniversary\nin the case of incentive stock options granted to employees who directly or indirectly own 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock.) A stock option terminates 30 days after a participant ceases to be an officer, manager, employee or director as a result of a termination without cause, and after 10 days of termination in the case of a termination for cause. Cause includes the conviction of a crime involving fraud, theft, dishonesty or moral turpitude, the participant\u2019s continuous disregard of or willful misconduct in carrying lawful instructions of superiors, continued use of alcohol or drugs that interfered with the performance of the participant\u2019s duties, the conviction of participant for committing a felony or similar foreign crime, and any other cause for termination set forth in a participant\u2019s employment agreement. A stock option terminates three months after the death or permanent disability of a participant, or, if the participant is a party to an employment agreement, the disability of such participant as defined in the employment agreement. Other reasons for termination may be set out in the award agreement.\nA stock option will not be considered an incentive stock option to the extent that the aggregate fair market value (on the date of the grant of the incentive stock option) of all stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by a participant during any calendar year is greater than $100,000. No stock option shall be affected by a change of duties or position of a participant (including a transfer to our subsidiaries) as long as the participant continues to be our employee or an employee of our subsidiaries.\nAdjustments upon the occurrence of material transactions. In the event we undergo dissolution or liquidation, a reorganization, merger or consolidation in which we are not the surviving entity, or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets (each, a \u201cMaterial Transaction\u201d), holders of sotck options will be given 10-day prior written notice and will decide within those 10 days whether to exercise their respective stock options. Any stock option that is not so exercised will terminate. However, such notice and exercise mechanism would not apply if provision is made in connection with a Material Transaction for assumption of outstanding stock options, or substitution of stock options for new stock options or equity securities, with any appropriate adjustments as to the number, kind and prices of shares subject to stock options.\nTransferability . Unless the prior written consent of the administrator is obtained, no stock option can be assigned or otherwise transferred by any participant except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Except in the case of an approved transfer, a stock option may be exercised during the lifetime of a participant only by the participant or his/her legal representative if the participant is legally disabled.\nRestricted stock . Restricted stock awards are awards of shares of common stock that vest according to the terms and conditions established by the administrator. The administrator may impose whatever restrictions on transferability, risk of forfeiture and other restrictions as it determines. A holder of restricted stock has the rights of a stockholder, including the right to vote the restricted stock. During the restricted period applicable to the restricted stock, it may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, margined or otherwise encumbered. Except as otherwise determined by the administrator, restricted stock that is subject to restrictions is subject to forfeiture upon termination of a participant\u2019s employment.\nOther awards . The administrator of the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan may grant additional equity-based or equity-related awards in such amounts and on such terms as it shall determine, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan. Each such award shall be denominated in, or shall have a value determined by reference to, a number of shares that is specified at the time of the grant of the award.\nAmendment . Our board of directors may modify the Amended and Restated 2009 Plan at any time. The approval by a majority of our stockholders is necessary if required by law or necessary to comply with any applicable laws and regulations. No amendment will affect the terms of any award granted prior to the effectiveness of such amendment, except with the consent of the holder of the award.",
