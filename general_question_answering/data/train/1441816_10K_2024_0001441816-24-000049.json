    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nMongoDB is the developer data platform company whose mission is to empower developers to create, transform, and disrupt industries by unleashing the power of software and data. Our developer data platform is an integrated set of database and related services that allow development teams to address the growing variety of modern application requirements, all in a unified and consistent user experience.\nThe foundation of our platform is the world\u2019s leading, modern general purpose database. Built on our unique document-based architecture, our database is designed to meet the needs of organizations for performance, scalability,\nflexibility and reliability while maintaining the strengths of relational databases. Every software application requires a database to store, organize and process data. Large organizations can have tens of thousands of applications and associated databases. A database directly impacts an application's performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability. As a result, selecting a database is a highly strategic decision that directly affects developer productivity, application performance and organizational competitiveness.\nThe global database market is dominated by legacy relational databases, which were first developed in the 1970s. Their underlying architecture remains largely unchanged even though the nature of applications, how they are deployed and their role in business has evolved dramatically. Modern software development is highly iterative and requires flexibility. Relational databases were not built to support the volume, variety and speed of data being generated today, hindering application performance and developer productivity. In a relational database environment, developers are often required to spend significant time fixing and maintaining the linkages between modern applications and the rigid database structures that are inherent in relational offerings. Further, relational databases were built before cloud computing and were not designed for \u201calways-on\u201d globally distributed deployments. These factors have left developers and their organizations in need of more agile and effective database alternatives. A number of non-relational database alternatives have attempted to address the limitations of relational databases, but they have not achieved widespread developer mindshare and marketplace adoption due to technical trade-offs in their product architectures and the resulting compromises developers are required to make in application development.\nOur database combines the best of both relational and non-relational databases. We believe our core platform differentiation is driven by our ability to address the needs of organizations for performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability while maintaining the strengths of relational databases. Our document-based architecture enables developers to manage data more naturally, making it easy and intuitive for developers to rapidly and cost-effectively build, modernize, deploy and maintain applications, thereby increasing the pace of innovation within an organization. Customers can run our database in any environment, depending on their operational requirements: fully managed as a service or self-managed in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment.\nIn 2023, generative artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) emerged as a significant technology trend. Generative AI is the process of generating original content by using foundation models (\u201cFMs\u201d), which are trained on large amounts of generally available data. Organizations of all sizes are looking at how to use their proprietary data in concert with FMs to drive better, AI-powered experiences for their customers. Organizations need a modern database to securely build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. We believe our database\u2019s document-based architecture and its run-anywhere capabilities provide organizations the flexibility they need to securely build and deploy truly innovative AI-powered applications, at any scale.\nIn addition to the database offering, our developer data platform includes additional capabilities that allow developers to address a broader range of application requirements. Our platform\u2019s integrated capabilities allow organizations to reduce the need for disparate, single-purpose data technologies, thereby lowering the cost and complexity of their application infrastructure. These complementary capabilities of our platform include:\n\u2022Search. Extends the developer interface for working with the database to search operations, simplifying the development of rich search experiences in applications. It also eliminates the need to run a separate search engine alongside the database and maintains the sync between the two systems.\n\u2022Vector search. Enables customers to easily and securely use pre-trained foundation models to leverage their own proprietary, up-to-date data for more accurate and trustworthy AI applications. Atlas Vector Search allows the integration of an operational database and vector search in a unified, and fully managed platform.\n\u2022Time series. Supports the entire end-to-end cycle of applications that leverage time series data, from ingestion, storage and querying to native data visualization and automated data archival in a single platform, which removes the need for complex integration, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing cost.\n\u2022Data lifecycle. Includes capabilities that help users more effectively manage the lifecycle of their application data. For example, MongoDB Atlas Online Archive helps users automatically tier aged data out of the database while keeping the data fully accessible.\n\u2022Application-driven analytics. Includes a wide range of capabilities to help development teams build richer application experiences that rely on automatic, low-latency analytical processing of live data. This includes rich aggregations and indexing strategies, as well as dedicated analytics nodes for workload isolation.\n\u2022Edge. Supports application deployments closer to where real-time data is generated, processed and stored across mobile devices, on-premises data centers and major cloud providers. Data is securely stored and synchronized in real time across data sources and destinations to provide highly available, resilient, and reliable applications.\nWe compete in the database management software market, which is one of the largest in the software industry. According to IDC, the data management software market is forecast to be $94 billion in 2023 growing to approximately $153 billion in 2027, representing a 13% compound annual growth rate. In 2023, a number of companies launched code assistant tools, which leverage generative AI to help developers write and test their code faster, thereby accelerating application development. We believe these developments in coding assistant technology will further benefit the data management software market.\nThe MongoDB Advantage\nThe key differentiating features and capabilities of our developer data platform include:\nWe Built Our Platform for Developers.\nMongoDB was built by developers for developers. We architected our platform with robust functionality and made it easy and intuitive for developers to build, modernize, deploy and maintain applications rapidly and cost-effectively, thereby increasing developer productivity. Our document-based architecture enables developers to manage and interact with data in a more natural way than legacy alternatives. As a result, developers can focus on the application and end-user experience, as they do not have to spend significant time fixing and maintaining the linkages between the application and a rigid relational database structure. We also develop and maintain drivers in all leading programming languages, allowing developers to interact with our platform using the programming language of their choice, further increasing developer productivity. MongoDB has been named as one of the most desired database technologies for developers since StackOverflow introduced databases as a category in their Annual Developer Survey in 2017.\nWe Built a Platform for Modern Applications.\nOur founders were frustrated by the challenges and limitations of working with legacy database offerings. Our platform was built to address these challenges and limits while maintaining the best aspects of relational databases, allowing developers both to build new, modern applications that could not be built on relational databases and to more quickly and easily modernize existing applications. In 2023, we announced the general availability of Relational Migrator, a tool that makes it easier for customers to migrate their existing applications from their legacy relational databases to MongoDB. While the percentage varies from quarter to quarter, over the past fiscal year, approximately one fifth of our new business related to MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, our proprietary commercial database offering, resulted from applications that were migrated from legacy relational databases.\nCore features and benefits of our platform include:\n\u2022Versatility. Our developer data platform supports a broad range of workloads and offers our customers a host of features and services that complement our database offering. Our platform provides an integrated solution that precludes the need for single-purpose technologies, and allows our customers to reduce the cost and back-end complexity of their application infrastructure, as well as increase the speed of innovation.\n\u2022Performance. We deliver the extreme throughput and predictable low-latency required by the most demanding applications, delivering millions of operations per second.\n\u2022Scalability. Our architecture scales horizontally across thousands of servers, supporting petabytes of data and millions of users in a globally distributed environment. It is easy to add capacity to our platform in a modular, predictable and cost-efficient manner. Applications can be run anywhere with our global multi-cloud reach.\n\u2022Flexibility and Control. MongoDB's intelligent distributed systems architecture enables users to easily place data where their applications and users need it. MongoDB can be run within and across geographically distributed data centers and cloud regions, providing levels of scalability, workload isolation and data locality to meet today's modern application requirements.\n\u2022Reliability. Our platform includes the critical, advanced security features and fault-tolerance that enterprises demand. It was built to operate in a globally distributed environment for \u201calways-on\u201d applications. Our multi-cloud\nand global reach empowers applications to withstand regional outages while addressing the most demanding data security and privacy requirements.\nWe Allow Customers to Run Any Application Anywhere.\nAs a developer data platform, we support applications across a wide range of use cases. Our platform is easily configurable, allowing customers to adjust settings and parameters to optimize performance for a specific application and use case. Customers can run our platform in any environment, depending on their operational requirements: fully managed as a service or self-managed in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment. Customers can deploy our platform in any of the major public clouds, providing them with increased flexibility and cost-optimization opportunities by enabling public cloud vendor optionality. Our customers have a consistent experience regardless of infrastructure, providing optionality, flexibility and efficiency.\nCustomers of MongoDB Atlas, our multi-cloud developer data platform offering, enjoy the benefits of using MongoDB as a service in the public cloud, further enabling developers to focus on their application performance and end-user experience, rather than the back-end infrastructure lifecycle management. With MongoDB Atlas, organizations only have to manage how their applications use the database and are freed from the tasks of infrastructure provisioning, configuring operating systems, upgrading software and more.\nKey Customer Benefits\nOur platform delivers the following key business benefits for our customers:\n\u2022Maximize Competitive Advantage through Software and Data. Our platform is built to support modern applications, allowing organizations to harness the full power of software and data to drive competitive advantage. Developers use our platform to build new, operational and customer-facing applications, including applications that cannot be built on legacy databases. As a result, our platform can help drive our customers\u2019 ability to compete, improve end-user satisfaction, increase their revenue and gain market share.\n\u2022Increase Developer Productivity. By empowering developers to build and modernize applications quickly and cost-efficiently, we enable developers\u2019 agility and accelerate their time-to-revenue for new products. Our platform\u2019s document-based architecture and intuitive drivers make developing new applications and iterating on existing applications very efficient, increasing developer productivity. MongoDB Atlas allows developers to focus on application performance and end-user experience, rather than the database infrastructure management including provisioning, operating system configuration, upgrades, monitoring and backups.\n\u2022Deliver High Reliability for Mission-Critical Deployments. Our platform is designed to support mission-critical applications by being fault-tolerant and always-on, reducing downtime for our customers and minimizing the risk of lost revenue.\n\u2022Reduce Complexity. Our platform\u2019s integrated capabilities allow customers to reduce the need for disparate, single-purpose solutions, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of the application infrastructure required to support modern applications.\n\u2022Reduce Total Cost of Ownership. The speed and efficiency of application development using our platform, coupled with decreased developer resources required for application maintenance, can result in a significant reduction in the total cost of ownership for enterprises. In addition, our platform runs on commodity hardware, requires less oversight and management from operations personnel and can operate in the cloud provider of choice or other low-cost environments, leading to reduced application-related overhead costs for our customers and lower total cost of ownership.\nOur Products\nOur customers can implement our developer data platform as a managed service offering, or they can choose a self-managed option. MongoDB Atlas is our managed multi-cloud database-as-a-service (\u201cDBaaS\u201d) offering that includes an integrated set of database and related services. MongoDB Enterprise Advanced is our proprietary self-managed commercial offering for enterprise customers that can run in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment.\nMongoDB Atlas\nIn June 2016, we introduced MongoDB Atlas, our hosted multi-cloud DBaaS offering that includes comprehensive infrastructure and management, which we run and manage in the public cloud. MongoDB Atlas provides customers with a highly flexible, managed offering that includes automated provisioning and healing, comprehensive system monitoring, managed backup and restore, default security and other features that reduce operational complexity and increase application resiliency. MongoDB Atlas allows customers to remove themselves from the complexity of managing the database and related underlying infrastructure, so they can instead focus on the application and end-user experience and innovate more quickly to better serve their own customers and capitalize on new business opportunities.\nBuilt for resilience, scale, and security, MongoDB Atlas is available in more than 110 regions worldwide across all three major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services (\u2018\u2018AWS\u2019\u2019), Google Cloud Platform (\u2018\u2018GCP\u2019\u2019) and Microsoft Azure), enabling our customers to leverage the benefits of different cloud platforms for different use cases and helping them avoid infrastructure vendor lock-in. The availability of multi-cloud clusters on MongoDB Atlas allows organizations to deploy a fully managed, distributed database across multiple cloud providers simultaneously without the added operational complexity of managing data replication and migration across clouds.\nOver the years, we have introduced additional features and functionality, which have increased the capabilities of MongoDB Atlas and accelerated and expanded its adoption including Atlas Search, Atlas Device Sync, Atlas Data Federation and Atlas Charts.\nMore recently, we launched MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, a capability that significantly simplifies an organization\u2019s ability to use their proprietary data to build generative AI applications. Vectors are numerical representations of data that make it possible to discover similar or related data and can be used to securely combine proprietary data with the power of FMs. Our vector search product is closely integrated with our globally distributed operational database, allowing customers to store all types of data needed for an AI-enabled application - vector data, metadata and operational data.\nMongoDB also launched a preview of MongoDB Atlas Stream Processing, which transforms the way organizations can process streaming data to engage end-users and speed up operations. MongoDB Atlas Stream Processing works with any type of data, and with its flexible data model, enables customers to build highly engaging applications that can analyze data in real-time to adjust application behavior and inform business operations. Customers now have a single interface to easily extract insights from high-velocity and high-volume streaming data.\nTogether, these new features and capabilities for MongoDB Atlas enable businesses to improve operational efficiency and speed up their pace of innovation by standardizing many types of workloads on a single developer data platform across the enterprise.\nMongoDB Atlas represented 66%, 63% and 56% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nMongoDB Enterprise Advanced\nMongoDB Enterprise Advanced is our proprietary self-managed commercial database offering for enterprise customers that can run in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment. MongoDB Enterprise Advanced is a subscription package that includes a commercial license to our platform and the following:\n\u2022MongoDB Enterprise Database Server. The MongoDB enterprise database server is our proprietary commercial database. It stores, organizes and processes data and facilitates access and changes to the data. It includes advanced security features, auditing functionality and enterprise-standard authentication and authorization, as well as encrypted and in-memory storage engines to enable a wide range of workloads.\n\u2022Enterprise Management Capabilities. MongoDB Enterprise Advanced customers can choose either our Cloud Manager Premium product (for customers who want to manage our platform via the cloud) or Ops Manager (generally for those with on-premises deployments), our sophisticated suite of management tools that allow operations teams to run, manage and configure MongoDB according to their needs.\n\u2022Analytics Integrations. We provide integrations to allow data and business analysts to analyze data in applications running on our platform using their existing business intelligence and analytics tools. Our analytics integrations ensure that enterprises can efficiently extract significant value from applications built on our platform.\nMongoDB Enterprise Advanced represented 26%, 28% and 34% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nProfessional Services\nWe provide professional services to our customers, including consulting and training, to make customer deployments of our platform successful, thereby increasing customer retention and driving customer revenue expansion. Given that we have designed our platform to be easily deployed, our services typically do not involve implementation and are designed to facilitate a more rapid and successful deployment of MongoDB by our customers. Professional services are an important part of our customer retention and expansion strategy. Customers who purchase professional services have typically increased their subscription usage with our platform and have done so more quickly than customers who have not engaged with our professional services.\nProfessional services represented 3% of our total revenue for the year ended January 31, 2024 and 4% of our total revenue for each of the years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFree Offerings\nTo encourage developer usage, familiarity and adoption of our platform, we offer Community Server and a free tier of MongoDB Atlas as \u201cfreemium\u201d offerings. Community Server is a free-to-download version of our database that includes the core functionality that developers need to get started with MongoDB but not all of the features of our commercial platform. Community Server is available under a license that protects our intellectual property and supports our business model. Our goal is to convert Community Server users to paying customers of our commercial offerings of MongoDB Atlas or MongoDB Enterprise Advanced. Our Community Server has been downloaded over 500 million times from our website alone since February 2009. Our free tier of MongoDB Atlas provides access to our hosted database solution with limited processing power and storage, as well as certain operational limitations.\nUnlike software companies built around third-party open source projects, we own the intellectual property of our offerings since we are the creators of the software, enabling our proprietary software subscription business model. Owning the intellectual property of our offering also allows us to retain control over our future product roadmap, including the determination of which features are included in our free or paid offerings.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe are pursuing our large market opportunity with growth strategies that include:\n\u2022Acquiring New Customers. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to continue to grow our customer base. We benefit from word-of-mouth awareness and frictionless experimentation by the developer community through our free offerings. As a result, our self-serve and direct sales prospects are often familiar with our platform and may have already built applications using our technology. While we sell to organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries, our key sales focus is on enterprises that invest more heavily in software application development and deployment. These organizations have a greater need for databases and, in the largest enterprises, can have tens of thousands of applications and associated databases. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our larger enterprise subscription base, both domestically and internationally.\n\u2022Expanding Sales Within Our Customer Base. We seek to grow our sales with our customers in several ways. As an application grows and requires additional capacity, our customers increase their spending on our platform. Our customers may expand their subscriptions to our platform as they migrate additional existing applications or build new applications, either within the same department or in other lines of business or geographies. Also, as customers modernize their information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) infrastructure and move to the cloud, they may migrate applications from legacy databases. Even within our largest customers, we believe we typically represent a small percentage of their overall spend on databases, reflecting our small market penetration. Our goal is to increase the number of customers that standardize on our database platform within their organization, which may include offering centralized internal support for developers within the organization or the deployment of an internal MongoDB-as-a-service offering. Our ability to expand within existing customers is demonstrated by our net annualized recurring revenue (\u201cARR\u201d) expansion rate, which has consistently been over 120%. See Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K for a description of ARR and a discussion of our net ARR expansion rate.\n\u2022Extending Product Leadership and Introducing New Products. We intend to continue to invest in our product offerings to expand the functionality and adoption of our platform. The guiding principle of our product innovation is to help developers solve more of their data challenges by utilizing our platform. During 2022, we introduced new features, capabilities and improvements such as column store indexes, in-app analytics, Atlas Serverless, Atlas Device Sync, allowing developer teams to accomplish more over a wider range of workloads. And with Queryable Encryption, we pioneered the industry\u2019s first encrypted search scheme using breakthrough cryptography engineering. During 2023, we added additional capabilities such as Atlas Vector Search and Atlas Stream Processing, as well as additional features for Atlas Search Nodes, which now provide dedicated infrastructure for search use cases so customers can scale independently of their database to manage their workloads with greater flexibility and operational efficiency.\n\u2022Fostering the MongoDB Developer Community. We have attracted a large and growing community of highly engaged developers, who have downloaded our Community Server offering over 500 million times from our website since February 2009. We believe that the engagement of developers increases our brand awareness. Many of these developers become proponents of MongoDB within their organizations, which may result in new customers selecting our platform, as well as expansion opportunities within existing customers. Historically, we have invested in our community through active sponsorship of user groups, our user conferences, MongoDB University and other community-centered events. As of January 31, 2024, there were over 2.0 million MongoDB University registrations. We intend to continue to invest in the MongoDB developer community.\n\u2022Growing and Cultivating Our Partner Ecosystem. We have built a partner ecosystem of independent software vendors, systems integrators, value added resellers, cloud and technology partners. For example, we have expanded our business partnerships with all three major cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure) to enhance our joint marketing initiatives, deliver technology integrations that benefit customers and align with our sales strategy. During 2023 we expanded our strategic partnership with Microsoft, to make it easier for customers to access MongoDB Atlas within the Microsoft commercial marketplace. We announced plans to integrate MongoDB Atlas Vector Search with Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that enables developers to build and scale generative AI applications. We also launched an AI initiative with GCP, which allows developers to take full advantage of MongoDB Atlas and industry-leading partner integrations with GCP's Vertex AI LLMs and new quick-start architecture reviews with MongoDB and GCP professional services to accelerate software development. . These technology partnerships continue to provide our customers with tools that help them modernize from legacy relational databases to MongoDB which, along with our other technology partnerships, provide us with significant benefits, including lead generation, new customer acquisition, marketplace fulfillment, accelerated deployment and additional customer support. We expanded our global partner ecosystem with the Alibaba Cloud partnership to offer an authorized MongoDB-as-a-Service solution to users in China. During 2023 we extended this partnership for another four years to allow their customers to easily adopt and consume MongoDB-as-a-service. Our reach in China is also supplemented by our global partnership with Tencent Cloud which allows customers to easily adopt and use MongoDB-as-a-Service across Tencent\u2019s global cloud infrastructure. We have also expanded our existing partnerships with independent software vendors and global systems integrators including IBM, Accenture, Infosys, Capgemini, Confluent, HCL, Wipro, Cognizant, Deloitte and Tata Consultancy Services. Our system integrator partners have also been valuable in working with organizations to migrate and modernize applications to our platform, including leveraging the cloud with MongoDB Atlas. We intend to continue to expand and enhance our partner relationships to benefit our global customers, grow our market presence and drive greater sales efficiency.\n\u2022Expanding Internationally. We believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand the use of our platform outside the United States. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue generated outside of the United States was 46%, 45% and 46% of our total revenue. We intend to continue to expand our sales and drive the adoption of our platform globally.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees and the culture we have established are critically important to our success. To continue to compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is crucial that we attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. To support these objectives, we strive to maintain our company culture, offer competitive compensation and benefits, support the health and well-being of our employees, foster an inclusive, diverse and engaged workforce and develop talent.\nAs of January 31, 2024, we had a total of 5,037 employees, including 2,456 employees located outside the United States. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of our business and we engage with legally recognized employee representative bodies in these locations as required. In accordance with the requirements of France, we have established a Social and Economic Committee composed of employer and elected staff representatives. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe provide competitive compensation and benefits for our employees globally. We continue to evolve our compensation programs to maintain competitive alignment with market practices while ensuring all pay decisions are driven by performance. Our compensation package may include base salary, commission or semi-annual bonuses and long-term equity awards. Where the market indicates, equity compensation continues to be an important tool to attract and retain talent. Employees in equity-eligible roles receive a new hire award at the time of hire and an annual performance-related refresh thereafter. To foster a strong sense of ownership and align our employees\u2019 interests with our long-term success, we offer all full-time employees globally the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan.\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer employees a wide array of benefits designed to be aligned with local reward practices and to be competitive with those offered by companies that we compete with for talent. In the United States, these include health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off, retirement benefits and additional resources to support employees' overall well-being. While the philosophy around our benefits is the same worldwide, specific benefits may vary by country due to local regulations and preferences.\nHealth, Safety and Well-Being\nWe believe the health, safety and well-being of our employees are vital to our success. We have introduced guidelines and regular reviews and trainings, which reflect our commitment to both the physical and psychological health and well-being of our employees. As part of this commitment, we recognize our responsibility to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees, contractors, customers and visitors.\nWe have a hybrid approach to working which we introduced in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our four working models help ensure that we are meeting business needs while also offering employees flexibility as it relates to their in-office presence. We continue to focus on gathering feedback from employees, assessing workplace safety and operational effectiveness, and seeking opportunities to enhance the overall experience for our hybrid workforce globally. We also offer training opportunities in managing a hybrid team for our people managers, and as it relates to the in-office employee experience, we aim to provide opportunities for collaboration and social interaction. We have several hub offices and a network of satellite offices in locations around the world and continue to introduce new workplace initiatives to enhance the employee experience.\nAs it relates to employee well-being, we offer a range of benefits under our four pillars of well-being:\n\u2022Physical well-being. We offer our employees access to comprehensive and competitive medical coverage in local markets, often covering the employee and dependent premiums. Our plans often include dental, optical, maternity, hospitalization and outpatient care, among other coverages, as well as comprehensive travel medical coverage while they travel for work assignments. To promote healthy lifestyles, we also offer employees access to highly subsidized or discounted monthly gym and exercise class memberships.\n\u2022Financial well-being. We believe that financial security is an enabler of creativity and productivity, which is why we offer retirement saving options for our employees, as well as benefits such as life insurance, disability insurance, critical illness and accident coverage.\n\u2022Emotional well-being. Our employees and their families have 24-hour access to our Employee Assistance Program (\u201cEAP\u201d). Our EAP offers confidential guidance on matters such as family support, mental health and legal assistance. Through local partners, employees have access to free counseling and coaching sessions. Globally we also have a team of mental Health First Aiders, who are trained to be a point of contact for any of our employees experiencing emotional distress. In addition, all employees receive a complimentary subscription to a meditation app, which provides hundreds of themed meditation sessions on everything from sleep to focus to reducing stress.\n\u2022Family well-being. We provide global fertility benefits to our employees and their partners, including fertility care, adoption and surrogacy assistance and unlimited access to 1:1 guidance with certified practitioners. In the United States and some of our bigger geographies, we also offer backup childcare support. We feel strongly that parents should be able to share the responsibilities of caregiving and our parental leave policy gives all new parents at least 20 weeks of paid leave. Globally, our employees also have access to personalized guidance to parents and caregivers, offering a full spectrum of family support for those with children of all ages.\nTalent & Leadership Development\nPromoting the professional growth and development of our top talent is an essential tool for retention and ensuring our continued success as we navigate the challenges of scaling in a competitive business environment. In addition to our ongoing delivery of professional and technical skill growth, we focus on two key levers for developing our talent. First, we are committed to developing talent using our performance and growth framework, which equips managers and employees to not only deliver great results, but also facilitates semi-annual employee performance and growth conversations, that include employee self-reflections, and ensures managers have the opportunity to provide clear expectations and feedback in support of a high bar for performance and ongoing employee development. Second, we are focused on leadership development at all levels at MongoDB, which includes new manager onboarding, as well as leadership development for first-line managers and second-line leaders. We also integrated a new set of leadership principles into our leadership development programs and tools to teach behaviors that leaders need to succeed and build team culture. Teams are also encouraged to seek customized leadership development programming for their leaders, to drive a precision focus on business needs.\nOur Culture\nWe believe our culture is critical to our success and has delivered tangible financial and operational benefits for our customers, our employees and our stockholders. Our culture is grounded in our new Leadership Commitment framework that was rolled out to all employees during the year: \u201call employees at MongoDB are keepers of our culture and expected to do three things. To be successful, we must deliver the right outcomes for our customers (what we do), live our values in everything we do (why we do it), and engage with each other as leaders (how we do it).\u201d Our company values are:\n\u2022Think Big, Go Far. We are big dreamers with a passion for creativity. We eagerly pursue new opportunities and markets through innovation and disruption. We have a pioneering spirit - always ready to forge new paths and take smart risks.\n\u2022Build Together. We achieve amazing things by connecting and leveraging the diversity of perspectives, skills, experiences and backgrounds of our entire organization. We place the success of the company over any individual or team. We discuss things thoroughly, but prioritize commitment over consensus.\n\u2022Embrace the Power of Differences. We commit to creating a culture of belonging, where people of different origins, backgrounds and experiences feel valued and heard. This is cultivated by learning from and respecting each other\u2019s similarities and differences. We approach conversations with positive intent and believe that others value the perspective we bring to the table. We recognize that a diverse workforce is the best way to broaden our perspectives, foster innovation and enable a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\u2022Make It Matter. We are relentless in our pursuit of meaningful impact. We think strategically and are clear on what we are and are not trying to do. We accomplish an amazing amount of important work and we are obsessed with delivering on our commitments.\n\u2022Be Intellectually Honest. We embrace reality. We apply high-quality thinking and rigor and operate with transparency. We have courage in our convictions but work hard to ensure biases or personal beliefs do not get in the way of finding the best solution.\n\u2022Own What You Do. We take ownership and are accountable for everything that we do. We empower and we are empowered to make things happen and balance independence with interdependence. We demand excellence from ourselves. We each play our own part in making MongoDB a great place to work.\nWe are committed to creating a culture that reflects our value of embracing the power of differences to drive better business outcomes. We strive toward having an employee population with diverse backgrounds and perspectives that are representative of our customers and to ensure all employees are both engaged and feel included.\nWe have expanded our efforts to recruit a more diverse workforce by embedding the capability to recruit diverse talent within our entire recruiting organization and investing in diversity sourcing and insights teams, diverse recruitment marketing campaigns and external partnerships. As signatories to the Corporate Parity Pledge, we have also committed to interview at least one qualified female candidate for every open role at the vice president level and above, as well as for every additional directorship on our Board of Directors. Additionally, we continue to focus on ways to accelerate the development of our under-represented groups through additional training and mentorship programs.\nWe are investing to ensure all of our employees feel included by developing and rolling out inclusive leadership training that uses our values to teach leaders how to create and sustain an inclusive culture. We have kicked off this training with our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) which are an important mechanism for supporting our employees from various backgrounds. Our ERGs include BEAM (Black Employees At MongoDB), Config.MDB (neurodivergent and people with disabilities), Green Team (sustainable, social, and environmental responsibility), MDBWomen (employees identifying as women), MongoDB_ API (Asian American and Pacific Islander community), Queer Collective (members of the LGBTQIA+ community and allies), Queeries (a safe environment for those identifying as LGBTQIA+), QueLatine (honoring the diversity of Latine heritage), Sell Like a Girl (those identifying as women in sales), UGT (underrepresented genders in tech), and Veterans (employees who are veterans of the armed forces). These groups focus on providing community support, professional development and business impact and are supported by executive sponsors. Our ERGs play an important role in our overall company culture by helping us raise awareness of issues unique to their members\u2019 experiences.\nFinally, we are committed to pay equity, regardless of gender, ethnicity or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee\u2019s role and experience, job location and performance. In addition, to reduce the risk of bias and help ensure consistent pay practices, we use a third-party tool to conduct annual pay parity checks.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe conduct anonymous engagement surveys regularly to help us understand the employee experience, identify areas of strength and development opportunities among teams, measure the effectiveness of our people and culture initiatives and understand employees\u2019 sentiments on management. These surveys are managed by a third-party vendor to encourage candor. The results are reviewed by senior management, who analyze areas of progress or opportunity and work with their teams to determine actionable steps based on survey results. The results also drive organization-wide focus areas and commitments focused on leadership, culture and inclusion.\nOur Customers\nAs of January 31, 2024, we had over 47,800 customers spanning a wide range of industries in more than 100 countries around the world. All affiliated entities are counted as a single customer. No single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal year 2024. All affiliated entities are counted as a single customer and our definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d excludes users of our free offerings.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing teams work together closely to drive awareness and adoption of our platform, accelerate customer acquisition and generate and increase revenue from customers. While we sell to organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries, our key sales focus is on enterprises that invest more heavily in software application development and deployment. These organizations have a greater need for databases and, in the largest enterprises, can have tens of thousands of applications and associated databases. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our larger enterprise subscription base, both domestically and internationally.\nOur go-to-market model is primarily focused on driving awareness and usage of our platform among software developers with the goal of converting that usage into paid consumption of our platform. We are a pioneer of developer evangelism and education and have cultivated a large, highly engaged global developer community. We foster developer engagement through community events and conferences to demonstrate how developers can create or modernize applications quickly and intuitively using our platform. We intend to continue to cultivate our relationships with developers through continued investment in and growth of our MongoDB Advocacy Hub, User Groups and MongoDB University.\nTo drive developer awareness of, engagement with, and adoption of our platform, we created our Community Server and MongoDB Atlas free tier offerings. These let developers use, experiment and evaluate our platform frictionlessly, which we believe has contributed to our platform\u2019s popularity. We believe that developers are often advocates for us because of our\ndeveloper-focused approach. As a result, our self-serve and direct sales prospects are often familiar with our platform and may have already built applications using our technology. To assess the most likely commercial prospects, we employ a process-oriented and data-driven approach to customer acquisition. We utilize advanced marketing technologies and processes to drive awareness and engagement, educate and convert prospects into customers. We also analyze usage patterns of our self-serve and free tier users to identify those accounts that might benefit from engagement with our sales teams. As customers expand their usage of our platform, our relationships with them often evolve to include technology and business leaders within their organizations and our goal is to get organizations to standardize on our platform. Once our customers reach a certain spending level with us, we support them with customer success advocates to ensure their satisfaction and expand their usage of our platform. We also have a partner ecosystem of global system integrators, value-added resellers and independent software vendors, which we collectively refer to as strategic partners.\nOur sales and marketing organization includes sales development, inside sales, field sales, sales engineering and marketing personnel. As of January 31, 2024, we had 2,338 employees in our sales and marketing organization.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing our existing products and developing new products to extend our product leadership, increase our market penetration and deepen our relationships with our customers. Our research and development organization is built around small development teams. Our small development teams foster greater agility, which enables us to develop new, innovative products and make rapid changes to our infrastructure that increase resiliency and operational efficiency.\nAs of January 31, 2024, we had 1,226 employees in our research and development organization. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our platform.\nCompetition\nThe worldwide database software market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:\n\u2022mindshare with software developers and IT executives;\n\u2022product capabilities, including flexibility, scalability, performance, security and reliability;\n\u2022flexible deployment options, including fully managed as a service or self-managed in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment;\n\u2022ease of deployment;\n\u2022breadth of use cases supported;\n\u2022generative AI capabilities;\n\u2022ease of integration with existing IT infrastructure;\n\u2022robustness of professional services and customer support;\n\u2022price and total cost of ownership;\n\u2022adherence to industry standards and certifications, including cybersecurity standards and certifications;\n\u2022size of customer base and level of user adoption;\n\u2022strength of sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022brand awareness and reputation.\nWe believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above.\nWe primarily compete with established legacy database software providers such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and other similar companies. We also compete with public cloud providers that offer database functionality, such as AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure as well as other database software providers.\nSome of our actual and potential competitors, in particular the legacy database providers and large cloud providers, have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, more established relationships with current or potential customers and commercial partners, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. Such competitors may make their products available at a low cost or no cost basis to enhance their overall relationships with current or potential customers. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader offerings and can bundle competing products with hardware or other software offerings, including their cloud computing and customer relationship management platforms. Other large software and internet companies may also seek to enter our market. As we introduce new technologies, such as the ones we announced during fiscal year 2023, and as our existing markets see more market entry, we expect competition to intensify.\nSeasonality\nWe have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and operating results. We may experience variability and reduced comparability of our quarterly revenue and operating results with respect to the timing and nature of certain of our contracts, particularly multi-year contracts that contain a term license. We may also experience fluctuations as MongoDB Atlas revenue is recorded on a consumption basis and varies with usage, inclusive of seasonal variability. As MongoDB Atlas revenue continues to increase as a percentage of total revenue, these fluctuations may have a greater impact on our results of operations. We believe that seasonal fluctuations that we have experienced in the past may continue in the future.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand.\nAs of January 31, 2024, in the United States, we had been issued 77 patents, which expire between 2030 and 2041 and had 35 patent applications pending, of which 6 are provisional applications. In addition, as of January 31, 2024, we had 14 registered trademarks in the United States and 2 pending trademark applications in the United States.\nUnlike software companies built around open source projects, we own the intellectual property of our core offerings, allowing us to retain control over our future product roadmap, including the determination of which features are included in our free or paid offerings. All versions of Community Server released after October 16, 2018 are offered under the SSPL. Versions of Community Server released prior to October 16, 2018 are offered under the AGPL. Both the SSPL and the AGPL permit users to run the database without charge but subject to certain terms and conditions. The SSPL explicitly requires Community Server users that offer MongoDB as a third-party service to make publicly available the source code for all the programs used to offer such service. The AGPL requires users to make publicly available the source code for any modified version of the database that they distribute, run as a service or otherwise make available to end users. By contrast, we offer our Enterprise Server database under a commercial license that does not have this requirement and this is one of the reasons some organizations elect to buy a subscription including a commercial license to our platform. In addition, by offering Community Server under the SSPL and AGPL, we limit the appeal to other parties, including public cloud vendors, of monetizing our software without licensing it from us, further supporting our software subscription business model.\nIn addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.\nCorporate Information\nMongoDB, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in November 2007 under the name 10Gen, Inc. We changed our name to MongoDB, Inc. on August 27, 2013.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks or others not specified below materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisk Factors Summary\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk because we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as more fully described below. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022Our business and results of operations depend substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their usage of software and related services. Any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their usage of subscription offerings and related services could materially and adversely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.\n\u2022We have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future results of operations.\n\u2022We have a history of losses and as our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u2022Because we derive more than the majority of our revenue from MongoDB Atlas, failure of MongoDB Atlas to satisfy customer demands could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects and our future revenue may be more difficult to predict.\n\u2022We currently face significant competition and expect that intense competition will continue.\n\u2022If we do not effectively expand our sales and marketing organization, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers.\n\u2022Our decision to offer Community Server under the Server Side Public License (\u201cSSPL\u201d) may harm the adoption of Community Server.\n\u2022We could be negatively impacted if the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (the \u201cAGPL\u201d), the SSPL and other open source licenses under which some of our software is licensed are not enforceable.\n\u2022Our licensing model for Community Server could negatively affect our ability to monetize and protect our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022We could incur substantial costs in obtaining, maintaining, protecting, defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights and any failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our software and brand.\n\u2022If we are not able to introduce new features or services successfully and to make enhancements to our software or services, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u2022We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to continue to grow and to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, increase our revenue, improve our results of operations, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges.\n\u2022If we or our third-party service providers, experience a security breach or other security incident, or unauthorized access to personal, proprietary, confidential or other sensitive data is otherwise obtained, our software may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce or terminate their use of our software and we may face litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability and reputational damage.\n\u2022If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, especially among developers, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nUnfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions and our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depend on demand for database software and services generally and for our subscription offering and related services in particular. Current or future economic uncertainties or downturns could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, financial and credit market fluctuations, international trade relations and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, political turmoil, natural catastrophes, regional or global outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, volatility in the banking sector, warfare and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on information technology, disrupt the timing and cadence of key industry and marketing events and otherwise could materially and adversely affect the growth of our business.\nGeopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, terrorist activity or acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. Similarly, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had negative impacts on the global economy, including by contributing to rapidly rising costs of living (driven largely by higher energy prices) in Europe and created uncertainty in the global capital markets and is expected to have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. The ongoing military conflict between Israel and Hamas, and any resulting conflicts in the region, may have similar negative impacts. Further, other events outside of our control, including natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may materially and adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions and may continue to experience such disruptions in the future, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability. As a result of these factors, our revenues may be affected by both decreased customer acquisition and lower than anticipated revenue growth from existing customers. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in widespread unemployment, economic slowdown and extreme volatility.\nSimilarly, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and has caused and could continue to cause disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. The ongoing military conflict between Israel and Hamas, and any resulting conflicts in the region, may have similar negative impacts. Any such volatility and disruptions may have material and adverse consequences on us, the third parties on whom we rely or our customers. Increased inflation and/or interest rates can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including labor and employee benefit costs. Any significant increases in inflation and related increase in interest rates could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurther, to the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn and our database software is perceived by customers and potential customers as costly, or too difficult to deploy or migrate to, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. This could also result in an extension of our sales cycle with potential customers, thus increasing the time and cost associated with our sales process. Further, if our customers experience reductions in their technology spending, even if they choose to use our products, they may not purchase additional products and services in the future due to budget limitations.\nIn addition, the banking sector has previously experienced increased volatility as a result of several distressed or closed banks and financial institutions. While we have not suffered any material effects as a result of the increased financial market volatility, we do regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of government- insured limits, and if financial institutions used by us or our customers face insolvency or illiquidity challenges due to events affecting the banking system and / or financial markets, our and our customers' ability to access existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments may be threatened. To the extent that the resulting receivership or insolvency causes customers to be unable to, or causes delays, in accessing bank deposits, our customers may not be able to pay us on time or at all for the products and services that we provide them and they may not renew their subscriptions with us. The failure of banks or financial institutions and the measures taken by governments, businesses and other organizations in response to such events could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, competitors, many of whom are larger and more established than we are, may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our subscription offerings and related services. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future results of operations.\nWe were incorporated in 2007 and introduced MongoDB Community Server in 2009, MongoDB Enterprise Advanced in 2013 and MongoDB Atlas in 2016. As a result of our limited operating history, our ability to forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to accurately predict future growth. Our historical revenue growth has been inconsistent and should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing adoption or usage of MongoDB or demand for our subscription offerings and related services, reduced conversion of users of our free offerings to paying customers, increasing competition, changes to technology or our intellectual property or our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. We have also encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nWe have a history of losses and as our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses in each period since our inception, including net losses of $176.6 million, $345.4 million and $306.9 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $1.7 billion as of January 31, 2024. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development and expand our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally. In particular, we have entered into non-cancelable multi-year capacity commitments with respect to cloud infrastructure services with certain third-party cloud providers, which require us to pay for such capacity irrespective of actual usage. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal,\naccounting and other expenses related to being a public company. While our revenue has grown in recent years, if our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than these increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability in future periods. As a result, we expect to continue to generate losses. We cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will be able to sustain profitability.\nBecause we derive more than the majority of our revenue from MongoDB Atlas, failure of MongoDB Atlas to satisfy customer demands could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects and our future revenue may be more difficult to predict.\nWe derive and expect to continue to derive more than the majority of our revenue from MongoDB Atlas, our database-as-a-service offering, which is primarily recognized on a usage-basis. As such, market adoption and usage of MongoDB Atlas is critical to our continued success. Although MongoDB Atlas has seen rapid adoption since its commercial launch in June 2016, and though we intend to continue to direct a significant portion of our financial and operating resources to develop and grow MongoDB Atlas, including offering a free tier of MongoDB Atlas to generate developer usage and awareness, we cannot guarantee that rate of adoption will continue at the same pace or at all. Demand for MongoDB Atlas is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic downturns, continued market acceptance by developers, the availability of our Community Server offering, the continued volume, variety and velocity of data that is generated, timing of development and release of new offerings by our competitors, technological change and the rate of growth in our market. For instance, among other factors, the adverse macroeconomic conditions resulted in slower than historical growth of our existing Atlas applications for the year ended January 31, 2024. If we are unable to continue to meet the demands of our customers and the developer community, our business operations, financial results and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected. In addition, because our customer\u2019s usage of MongoDB Atlas may vary for a number of reasons, our visibility into the timing of revenue recognition is limited. There is a risk that customers will consume our MongoDB Atlas offering more slowly than we expect, and our actual results may differ from our forecasts and our future revenue may be less predictable going forward due to, among other things, fluctuations in the rate of customer renewals and expansions and seasonality of, or fluctuations in, usage of MongoDB Atlas.\nOur business and results of operations depend substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their usage of software and related services. Any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their usage of subscription offerings and related services could materially and adversely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur subscription offerings are term-based and a majority of our subscription contracts were one year in duration in fiscal year 2024. In order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions with us when the existing subscription term expires and renew on the same or more favorable quantity and terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions and we may not be able to accurately predict customer renewal rates. In addition, the growth of our business depends in part on our customers expanding their use of subscription offerings and related services, including increasing their usage and workloads with us. Historically, some of our customers have elected not to renew their subscriptions with us or have not expanded their usage of our services over time for a variety of reasons, including as a result of changes in their strategic IT priorities, budgets, costs and, in some instances, due to competing solutions. Our retention rate may also decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our software, the increase in the contract value of subscription and support contracts from new customers, the effectiveness of our customer support services, our pricing, the prices of competing products or services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, global economic conditions and the other risk factors described herein. As a result, we cannot assure you that customers will renew subscriptions or increase their usage of our software and related services. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or renew on less favorable terms, or if we are unable to expand our customers\u2019 usage of our software, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, to the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn and our database software is perceived by customers and potential customers as costly, or too difficult to deploy or migrate to, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. See \u201c-Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\u201d\nWe currently face significant competition and expect that intense competition will continue.\nThe database software market, for both relational and non-relational database products, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and others may put out competing databases or sell services in connection with existing open source or source available databases, including ours. The principal competitive factors in our market include: mindshare with software developers and information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) executives; product capabilities, including flexibility, scalability, performance, security and reliability; flexible deployment options, including fully managed as a service or self-managed in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment and ease of deployment; breadth of use cases supported; ease of integration with existing IT infrastructure; robustness of professional services and customer support; price and total cost of ownership; adherence to industry standards and certifications, including cybersecurity standards and certifications; size of customer base and level of user adoption; strength of sales and marketing efforts; and brand awareness and reputation. If we fail to compete effectively with respect to any of these competitive factors, we may fail to attract new customers or lose or fail to renew existing customers, which would cause our business and results of operations to suffer.\nWe primarily compete with established legacy database software providers such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and other similar companies. We also compete with public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), Google Cloud Platform (\u201cGCP\u201d) and Microsoft Azure that offer database functionality and with non-relational database software providers. In addition, other large software and internet companies may seek to enter our market.\nSome of our actual and potential competitors, in particular the legacy relational database providers and large cloud providers, have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, more established relationships with current or potential customers and commercial partners, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. Such competitors may make their products available at a low cost or no cost basis in order to enhance their overall relationships with current or potential customers. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services. As we introduce new technologies and product enhancements and as our existing markets see more market entry, we expect competition to intensify in the future. In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader offerings and can bundle competing products with hardware or other software offerings, including their cloud computing and customer relationship management platforms. As a result, customers may choose a bundled offering from our competitors, even if individual products have more limited functionality compared to our software. These larger competitors are also often in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in technology spending and will therefore not be as susceptible to competition or economic downturns. In addition, some competitors may offer products or services that address one or a limited number of functions at lower prices, with greater depth than our products or in geographies where we do not operate.\nFurthermore, our actual and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and offerings in the markets we address. In addition, third parties with greater available resources may acquire current or potential competitors. As a result of such relationships and acquisitions, our actual or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their offerings more quickly than we do. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors.\nIf we do not effectively expand our sales and marketing organization, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers.\nIncreasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our subscription offerings and related services will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities. We are substantially dependent on our direct sales force and our marketing efforts to obtain new customers. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organization both domestically and internationally. We believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require, particularly as we continue to target larger enterprises. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals, especially in highly competitive markets. New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new or developing sales territories. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business, particularly during the current period of heightened employee attrition in the United States and other countries. Because of our limited operating history, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our\nsales will increase as we expand our sales and marketing organization or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. Our business and results of operations could be harmed if the expansion of our sales and marketing organization does not generate a significant increase in revenue.\nOur adoption strategies include offering Community Server and a free tier of MongoDB Atlas and we may not be able to realize the intended benefits of these strategies.\nTo encourage developer usage, familiarity and adoption of our platform, we offer Community Server as a \u201cfreemium\u201d offering. Community Server is a free-to-download version of our database that does not include all of the features of our commercial platform. We also offer a free tier of MongoDB Atlas in order to accelerate adoption, promote usage and drive brand and product awareness. We do not know if we will be able to convert these users to paying customers of our platform. Our marketing strategy also depends in part on persuading users who use one of these free versions to convince others within their organization to purchase and deploy our platform. To the extent that users of Community Server or our free tier of MongoDB Atlas do not become, or lead others to become, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of these strategies and our ability to grow our business or achieve profitability may be harmed.\nOur decision to offer Community Server under the SSPL, may harm the adoption of Community Server.\nOn October 16, 2018, we announced that we were changing the license for Community Server from the AGPL to a new software license, the SSPL. The SSPL builds on the spirit of the AGPL, but includes an explicit condition that any organization attempting to exploit MongoDB as a service must open source the software that it uses to offer such service. Since the SSPL is a new license and has not been interpreted by any court, developers and the companies they work for may be hesitant to adopt Community Server because of uncertainty around the provisions of the SSPL and how it will be interpreted and enforced. In addition, the SSPL has not been approved by the Open Source Initiative, nor has it been included in the Free Software Foundation\u2019s list of free software licenses. This may negatively impact the adoption of Community Server, which in turn could lead to reduced brand and product awareness, ultimately leading to a decline in paying customers and our ability to grow our business or achieve profitability may be harmed.\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including annualized recurring revenue (\u201cARR\u201d), annualized monthly recurring revenue (\u201cMRR\u201d), ARR expansion rate, Total Customers, Direct Sales Customers, MongoDB Atlas Customers, Customers over 100K and Downloads of our platform and non-GAAP metrics such as non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and free cash flow. These operational metrics are tracked with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, we expect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe could be negatively impacted if the AGPL, the SSPL and other open source licenses under which some of our software is licensed are not enforceable.\nThe versions of Community Server released prior to October 16, 2018 are licensed under the AGPL. This license states that any program licensed under it may be copied, modified and distributed provided certain conditions are met. On October 16, 2018, we issued a new software license, the SSPL, for all versions of Community Server released on or after that date. The SSPL builds on the spirit of the AGPL, but includes an explicit condition that any organization using Community Server to offer MongoDB as a third-party service must open source the software that it uses to offer such service. It is possible that a\ncourt could hold the SSPL or AGPL to be unenforceable. If a court held either license or certain aspects of this license to be unenforceable, others may be able to use our software to compete with us in the marketplace in a manner not subject to the restrictions set forth in the SSPL or AGPL.\nOur licensing model for Community Server could negatively affect our ability to monetize and protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe make our Community Server offering available under either the SSPL (for versions released on or after October 16, 2018) or the AGPL (for versions released prior to October 16, 2018). Community Server is a free-to-download version of our database that includes the core functionality developers need to get started with MongoDB but not all of the features of our commercial platform. Both the SSPL and the AGPL grant licensees broad freedom to view, use, copy, modify and redistribute the source code of Community Server provided certain conditions are met. Some commercial enterprises consider SSPL- or AGPL-licensed software to be unsuitable for commercial use because of the \u201ccopyleft\u201d requirements of those licenses. However, some of those same commercial enterprises do not have the same concerns regarding using the software under the SSPL or AGPL for internal purposes. As a result, these commercial enterprises may never convert to paying customers of our platform. Anyone can obtain a free copy of Community Server from the internet and we do not know who all of our SSPL or AGPL licensees are. Competitors could develop modifications of our software to compete with us in the marketplace. We do not have visibility into how our software is being used by licensees, so our ability to detect violations of the SSPL or AGPL is extremely limited.\nIn addition to Community Server, we contribute other source code to open source projects under open source licenses and release internal software projects under open source licenses and anticipate doing so in the future. Because the source code for Community Server and any other software we contribute to open source projects or distribute under open source licenses is publicly available, our ability to monetize and protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such source code may be limited or, in some cases, lost entirely.\nOur software incorporates third-party open source software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.\nOur software includes third-party open source software and we intend to continue to incorporate third-party open source software in our products in the future. There is a risk that the use of third-party open source software in our software could impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to monetize our software. Although we monitor the incorporation of open source software into our products to avoid such restrictions, we cannot be certain that we have not incorporated open source software in our products or platform in a manner that is inconsistent with our licensing model or that we have not breached the terms of an applicable open source license agreement, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. Certain open source projects also include other open source software and there is a risk that those dependent open source libraries may be subject to inconsistent licensing terms. This could create further uncertainties as to the governing terms for the open source software we incorporate.\nIn addition, the terms of certain open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated restrictions or conditions on our use of such software. Additionally, we may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the software or derivative works that we developed using such open source software, which could include proprietary portions of our source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source licenses. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make those proprietary portions of our source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated software or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources and we may not be able to complete it successfully.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, the use of third-party open source software can lead to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties, indemnities or other contractual protections with respect to the software (for example, non-infringement or functionality). There is typically no support available for open source software, and we cannot ensure that the authors of such open source software will implement or push updates to address security risks or will not abandon further development and maintenance. Our use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the source code for open source software is publicly available, which may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our systems and networks that rely on open source software. In addition, licensors of open source software included in our offerings may, from time to time, modify the terms of their license agreements in such a manner that those license terms may become incompatible with\nour licensing model and thus could, among other consequences, prevent us from incorporating the software subject to the modified license.\nAny of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to introduce new features or services successfully and to make enhancements to our software or services, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in part on our ability to enhance and improve our software and to introduce new features and services. To grow our business and remain competitive, we must continue to enhance our software and develop features that reflect the constantly evolving nature of technology and our customers\u2019 needs. For instance, with the development of next-generation solutions that utilize new and advanced features, including artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) and machine learning, we may be required to commit significant resources to developing new products, enhancements and developments. The success of new products, enhancements and developments depends on several factors: our anticipation of market changes and demands for product features, including timely product introduction and conclusion, sufficient customer demand, cost effectiveness in our product development efforts and the proliferation of new technologies that are able to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely. In addition, because our software is designed to operate with a variety of systems, applications, data and devices, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our software to keep pace with changes in such systems. We may not be successful in developing these modifications and enhancements. Furthermore, the addition of features and solutions to our software will increase our research and development expenses. Any new features that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner or may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue to justify the related expenses. It is difficult to predict customer adoption of new features. Such uncertainty limits our ability to forecast our future results of operations and subjects us to a number of challenges, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. If we cannot address such uncertainties and successfully develop new features, enhance our software or otherwise overcome technological challenges and competing technologies, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe also offer professional services including consulting and training and must continually adapt to assist our customers in deploying our software in accordance with their specific IT strategies. If we cannot introduce new services or enhance our existing services to keep pace with changes in our customers\u2019 deployment strategies, we may not be able to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our software or secure renewal contracts, which are important for the future of our business.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to penetrate the existing market for database products, as well as the growth and expansion of the market for database products.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our ability to service existing demand, as well as the continued growth and expansion of the database market. It is difficult to predict demand for our offerings, the conversion from one to the other and related services and the size, growth rate and expansion of these markets, the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products. Our ability to penetrate the existing database market and any expansion of the market depends on a number of factors, including cost, performance and perceived value associated with our subscription offerings, as well as our customers\u2019 willingness to adopt an alternative approach to relational and other database products available in the market. Furthermore, many of our potential customers have made significant investments in relational databases, such as offerings from Oracle, and may be unwilling to invest in new products. If the market for databases fails to grow at the rate that we anticipate or decreases in size or we are not successful in penetrating the existing market, our business would be harmed.\nOur future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price could decline substantially.\nOur results of operations, including our revenue, operating expenses and cash flows may vary significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Some of the factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022changes in actual and anticipated growth rates of our revenue, customers and other key operating metrics;\n\u2022new product announcements, pricing changes and other actions by competitors;\n\u2022the mix of revenue and associated costs attributable to subscriptions for our MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced offerings (such as our non-cancelable multi-year cloud infrastructure capacity commitments, which require us to pay for such capacity irrespective of actual usage) and professional services, as such relative mix may impact our gross margins and operating income;\n\u2022the mix of revenue and associated costs attributable to sales where subscriptions are bundled with services versus sold on a standalone basis and sales by us and our partners;\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities and teams;\n\u2022our ability to retain customers and expand their usage of our software, particularly for our largest customers;\n\u2022our inability to enforce the AGPL or SSPL;\n\u2022delays in closing sales, including the timing of renewals, which may result in revenue being pushed into the next quarter, particularly because a large portion of our sales occur toward the end of each quarter;\n\u2022the timing of revenue recognition;\n\u2022the mix of revenue attributable to larger transactions as opposed to smaller transactions;\n\u2022changes in customers\u2019 budgets and in the timing of their budgeting cycles and purchasing decisions;\n\u2022changes in customers\u2019 consumption of our platform;\n\u2022customers and potential customers opting for alternative products, including developing their own in-house solutions, or opting to use only the free version of our products;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022the timing and success of new products, features and services offered by us and our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners;\n\u2022significant security breaches or other security incidents, technical difficulties, or interruptions with respect to the delivery and use of our software;\n\u2022our failure to maintain the level of service uptime and performance required by our customers;\n\u2022the collectability of receivables from customers and resellers, which may be hindered or delayed if these customers or resellers experience financial distress;\n\u2022changes in political and economic conditions, in domestic or international markets;\n\u2022general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, including warfare and terrorist attacks on the United States and other regions in which we or our customers operate, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas conflict, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate;\n\u2022sales tax and other tax determinations by authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;\n\u2022the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and\n\u2022fluctuations in stock-based compensation expense.\nThe occurrence of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly and be materially and adversely affected. For example, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and the\nprice of our common stock may be particularly pronounced in the current economic environment due to the ongoing geopolitical instability resulting from the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, instability in the banking sector, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability. In response to the concerns over inflation risk, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times, and signaled that they will continue to adjust interest rates to stabilize and reduce current levels of inflation. It is especially difficult to predict the impact of such events on the global economic markets, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments, businesses, and other enterprises in response to the pandemic and macroeconomic events, and the effectiveness of those actions. Any of these factors or any combination thereof could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For instance, among other factors, the adverse macroeconomic conditions resulted in slower than historical growth of our existing Atlas applications for the year ended January 31, 2024. We also intend to continue to invest to grow our business and to take advantage of our market opportunity. Accordingly, historical patterns and our results of operations in any one quarter may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Additionally, if our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to continue to grow and to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, increase our revenue, improve our results of operations, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our business, operations and employee headcount. For fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, our total revenue was $1,683.0 million, $1,284.0 million and $873.8 million, respectively, representing a 31% and 47% growth rate, respectively. We have also significantly increased the size of our customer base from over 3,200 customers as of January 31, 2017 to over 47,800 customers as of January 31, 2024, and we grew from 713 employees as of January 31, 2017 to 5,037 employees as of January 31, 2024. We expect to continue to expand our operations and employee headcount in the near term. Our success will depend in part on our ability to continue to grow and to manage this growth, domestically and internationally, effectively.\nOur current and anticipated growth is expected to place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management processes and controls and our reporting procedures to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, which will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these infrastructure improvements effectively, our ability to ensure the uninterrupted operation of key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies will be impaired. Further, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our products and services could suffer, the preservation of our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment may change and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges. This could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our products and services, all of which would adversely affect our brand, overall business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we or our third-party service providers experience a security breach or other security incident, or unauthorized access to personal, proprietary, confidential or other sensitive data is otherwise obtained, our software may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce or terminate their use of our software and we may face litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability and reputational damage.\nCyberattacks, malicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our personal, proprietary, confidential and other sensitive data and our information technology systems and networks, and those of the third parties upon which we rely to help deliver services to our customers. Such threats are prevalent, increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and becoming increasingly difficult to detect and their frequency may be increased, and effectiveness enhanced, by the use of AI. These threats come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d threat actors (including organized criminal threat actors), \u201chacktivists,\u201d personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors. In addition, some actors, such as sophisticated nation-states and nation-state supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks, including without limitation for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon whom we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyberattacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and networks, operations and supply chain. We and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of\nevolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), credential harvesting, account takeovers, personnel misconduct or error, fraud, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss or theft of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, pandemics, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats.\nRansomware attacks, including by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. Similarly, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners\u2019 supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems (including our products) or the third-party information technology systems that support us and our services.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic increased our remote workforce, which increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more of our employees work from home, utilizing network connections, computers and devices outside our premises or network, including while at home, in transit and in public locations. Additionally, cybersecurity risks may be heightened as a result of the ongoing global conflicts such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries or the ongoing military conflict between Israel and Hamas. Furthermore, future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional data security risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities\u2019 systems and technologies. Risks related to data security will increase as we continue to grow the scale and functionality of our business and collect, store, transmit and otherwise process increasingly large amounts of our and our customers\u2019 information and data, which may include personal, proprietary, confidential or other sensitive data.\nAny of the above identified or similar threats could cause a security breach or other security incident that could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure, transfer, use or other processing of, or access to our information technology systems and networks or personal, proprietary, confidential or other sensitive information, or those of the third parties upon whom we rely. For example, in December 2023 we discovered that a previously unknown flaw in a third-party application used by MongoDB enabled an unauthorized third party to successfully phish and to gain access to certain corporate applications, including applications that we use to provide support services to MongoDB customers, which include customer contact information and related account metadata. In an effort to contain the impact of this security incident, we immediately activated our incident response process, promptly published an alert on our website and emailed customers notifying them of the situation and reminding them to stay vigilant. The investigation led by MongoDB into this incident uncovered no evidence of unauthorized access to MongoDB Atlas clusters, a finding that has been verified by our third-party forensic experts. To date, we have not experienced a cybersecurity event that had a material impact on our financial performance or operations, but it is possible that we might experience such an attack in the future. A security breach or other security incident could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our platform, products, and services.\nWe may expend significant resources or modify our business activities to try to protect against, mitigate or remediate actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and networks and personal, proprietary, confidential or other sensitive information.\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security breaches and other security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. We have not always been able in the past and may be unable in the future to detect vulnerabilities in our information technology systems and networks (including our products) because such threats and techniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, and may not be detected until after a security breach or other security incident has occurred. For example, industry publications have reported ransomware attacks on MongoDB instances. We believe these attacks were successful due to the failure by users of our Community Server offering to properly turn on the recommended security settings when running these instances. Despite our efforts to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, if any, in our information technology systems and networks (including our products), our efforts may not be successful. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities.\nWe use third-party service providers and subprocessors to help us deliver services to our customers. These third-party service providers and subprocessors may collect, store, transmit or otherwise process personal data or other confidential information of our employees and our customers. Our ability to monitor these third parties\u2019 information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. Due to applicable laws, regulations, rules, standards, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations, we may be held responsible for security breaches or other security incidents attributed to our third-party service providers as they relate to the information we share with them.\nApplicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches and other security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences.\nIf we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience or are perceived to have experienced a security breach or other security incident, or fail to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, regulators, law enforcement agencies or affected individuals, as applicable, following any such event, we may experience adverse consequences. These consequences may include: liability under applicable data privacy and security laws, regulations, rules, standards, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations; obligations to notify regulators and affected individuals; government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing personal and other sensitive information; litigation (including class claims); indemnification and other contractual obligations; damages; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security breaches and other security incidents and attendant consequences may cause customers to stop using our platform, products, and services, deter new customers from using our platform, products, and services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations.\nWhile we maintain general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions, we cannot assure you that such coverage will be adequate or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of personal, proprietary, confidential or other sensitive data or otherwise relating to data privacy and security matters. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nOur sales cycle may be long and is unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.\nThe timing of our sales and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our offerings. We are often required to spend significant time and resources to better educate and familiarize potential customers with the value proposition of paying for our products and services. The length of our sales cycle, from initial evaluation to payment for our offerings is generally three to nine months, but can vary substantially from customer to customer or from application to application within a given customer. As the purchase and deployment of our products can be dependent upon customer initiatives, our sales cycle can extend to more than a year for some customers. Customers often view a subscription to our products and services as a strategic decision and significant investment and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our product offering prior to entering into or expanding a subscription. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing and contract negotiation activities, which may not result in a sale. Additional factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales force, in particular new sales people as we increase the size of our sales force;\n\u2022the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;\n\u2022the obstacles placed by a customer\u2019s procurement process;\n\u2022our ability to convert users of our free offerings to paying customers;\n\u2022economic conditions and other factors impacting customer budgets;\n\u2022customer evaluation of competing products during the purchasing process; and\n\u2022evolving customer demands.\nGiven these factors, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed and when revenue from a sale will be recognized, particularly the timing of revenue recognition related to the term license portion of our subscription revenue. In addition, as a result of rising inflation and interest rates, and global economic uncertainty, potential customers may consider reducing or delaying, technology or other discretionary spending, which could also result in an extension of our sales cycle. This could impact the variability and comparability of our quarterly revenue results and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be forced to reduce prices for our subscription offerings and as a result our revenue and results of operations will be harmed.\nAs the market for databases evolves, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers or convert users of our free offerings to paying customers on terms or based on pricing models that we have used historically. In the past, we have been able to increase our prices for our subscription offerings, but we may choose not to introduce or be unsuccessful in implementing future price increases. As a result of these and other factors, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or be unable to increase our prices, or it may be necessary for us to increase our services or product offerings without additional revenue to remain competitive, all of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers in a manner that is cost-effective and assures customer success, we will not be able to grow our business, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn order to grow our business, we must continue to attract new customers in a cost-effective manner and enable these customers to realize the benefits associated with our products and services. We may not be able to attract new customers for a variety of reasons, including as a result of their use of traditional relational and/or other database products and their internal timing, budget or other constraints that hinder their ability to migrate to or adopt our products or services.\nEven if we do attract new customers, the cost of new customer acquisition, product implementation and ongoing customer support may prove so high as to prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability. For example, in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, total sales and marketing expense represented 47%, 54% and 54% of revenue, respectively. We intend to continue to hire additional sales personnel, increase our marketing activities to help educate the market about the benefits of our platform and services, grow our domestic and international operations and build brand awareness. We also intend to continue to cultivate our relationships with developers through continued investment in our MongoDB .local events, MongoDB Advocacy Hub, User Groups, MongoDB University and our partner ecosystem of global system integrators, value-added resellers and independent software vendors. If the costs of these sales and marketing efforts increase dramatically, if we do not experience a substantial increase in leverage from our partner ecosystem, or if our sales and marketing efforts do not result in substantial increases in revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, while we expect to continue to invest in our professional services organization to accelerate our customers\u2019 ability to adopt our products and ultimately create and expand their use of our products over time, we cannot assure you that any of these investments will lead to the cost-effective acquisition of additional customers.\nIf we fail to offer high quality support, our business and reputation could suffer.\nOur customers rely on our personnel for support of our software and services included in our subscription packages. High-quality support is important for the renewal and expansion of our agreements with existing customers. The importance of high-quality support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell new software to existing and new customers could suffer and our reputation and relationships with existing or potential customers could be harmed.\nReal or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nOur software is complex and therefore, undetected errors, failures or bugs have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Our software is used in IT environments with different operating systems, system management software, applications, devices, databases, servers, storage, middleware, custom and third-party applications and equipment and\nnetworking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in the IT environment into which our software is deployed. This diversity increases the likelihood of errors or failures in those IT environments. Despite testing by us, real or perceived errors, failures or bugs may not be found until our customers use our software. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our products could result in negative publicity, security breaches or other security incidents, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our software, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, harm to our brand, weakening of our competitive position, or claims by customers for losses sustained by them or failure to meet the stated service level commitments in our customer agreements. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend significant additional resources in order to help correct the problem. Any real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software could also impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers or expand their use of our software, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, standards, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations particularly related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; a disruption of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; and other adverse business consequences.\nData privacy and security is a significant issue in the United States, Europe and in many other countries and jurisdictions where we offer our software and services. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, share and otherwise process personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, and intellectual property. We collect personal information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad and may store or otherwise process such information outside of the country in which it was collected. Our data processing activities subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, rules, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts, and other obligations that govern the processing of personal data by us and on our behalf.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. For example, at the federal level, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce (which extends to data privacy and security practices), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. At the state level, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the \u201cCCPA\u201d) gives California residents the right to, among other things, request disclosure of personal information collected about them and whether that information has been sold to others, request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), opt out of sales of their personal information, and not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA also authorizes private lawsuits to recover statutory damages for certain data breaches. The effects of the CCPA are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to personal information we collect about California residents. For example, in August 2022 California\u2019s Attorney General reached a settlement with Sephora, Inc. (\u201cSephora\u201d) for failing to satisfy certain obligations under the CCPA, including the disclosure and processing of opt-out requests, with respect to using third-party tracking software on Sephora's website that could, among other things, create profiles about website visitors that the California Attorney General interpreted as a \"sale\" of customer information given the benefits that both the software provider and Sephora received from the relationship. This action may signal a priority of enforcement and interpretation that such use of analytics products on the internet may introduce new web-based marketing complexities and compliance challenges under the CCPA.\nA number of other U.S. states have also enacted, or are considering enacting, comprehensive data privacy laws that share similarities with the CCPA. Certain state laws and regulations may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal data than federal or other state laws and regulations, and such laws and regulations may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal data has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. These laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly.\nFurthermore, on May 12, 2021, the Biden administration issued an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to implement additional IT security measures, including, among other things, requiring agencies to adopt multifactor authentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit, to the maximum extent consistent with federal records laws and\nother applicable laws. Additionally, the Executive Order called for the development of secure software development practices or criteria for a consumer software labeling program reflecting a baseline level of secure practices for development of software sold to the U.S. federal government. Due to the Executive Order, federal agencies may require us to modify our cybersecurity practices and policies and increase our compliance costs and, if we are unable to meet the requirements of the Executive Order, it could impede our ability to work with the U.S. government and result in a loss of revenue.\nInternationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data privacy and security legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including, but not limited to, the European Economic Area (\u201cE.E.A.\u201d), Switzerland, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), Canada, Brazil and other countries. The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the E.E.A. is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), and other European laws governing the processing of personal data. Data protection authorities in the E.E.A. have the power to impose administrative fines for violations of the GDPR of up to a maximum of \u20ac20 million or 4% of the entity\u2019s total worldwide global turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Further, the GDPR provides for private litigation related to the processing of personal data that can be brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent the data subjects\u2019 interests. Since we act as a data processor for our MongoDB Atlas customers, we have taken steps to cause our processes to be compliant with applicable portions of the GDPR, but because of the ambiguities in the GDPR and the evolving interpretation of the GDPR by data protection authorities, we cannot assure you that such steps are complete or effective.\nFollowing the exit of the U.K. from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), the GDPR was transposed into U.K. law (the \u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d) as supplemented by the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018, which currently imposes the same obligations as the GDPR in most material respects. Failure to comply with the U.K. GDPR can result in fines up to a maximum of \u00a317.5 million or 4% of the entity\u2019s total worldwide global turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. However, the U.K. GDPR will not automatically incorporate changes made to the GDPR going forward (which would need to be specifically incorporated by the U.K. government). Moreover, the U.K. government has publicly announced plans to reform the U.K. GDPR in ways that, if formalized, are likely to deviate from the GDPR, all of which creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty, along with the potential for increased compliance costs and risks for affected businesses.\nCountries outside Europe are implementing significant limitations on the processing of personal data, similar to those in the GDPR. For example, Brazil has enacted the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or \u201cLGPD\u201d) (Law No. 13,709/2018). In addition, on June 5, 2020, Japan passed amendments to its Act on the Protection of Personal data, or APPI. Both of these laws broadly regulate the processing of personal data in a manner comparable to the GDPR, and violators of the LGPD and APPI face substantial penalties.\nSome foreign data privacy and security laws, including, without limitation, the GDPR, the U.K. GDPR, and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection may restrict the cross-border transfer of personal data, such as transfers of data to the United States from the E.E.A., Switzerland or U.K. These laws may require data exporters and data importers - as a condition of cross-border data transfers - to implement specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal data. Existing mechanisms that facilitate cross-border personal data transfers may change or be invalidated. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the E.E.A. that the European Commission does not consider to provide an adequate level of data privacy and security, such as the United States, unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal data, such as, most commonly, the \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d (\u201cSCCs\u201d) released by the European Commission. Use of the SCCs imposes additional compliance burdens, such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the at-issue personal data. Although the U.K. currently has an adequacy decision from the European Commission, such that SCCs are not required for the transfer of personal data from the E.E.A. to the U.K., that decision will sunset in June 2025 unless extended and it may be revoked in the future by the European Commission if the U.K. data protection regime is reformed in ways that deviate substantially from the GDPR. Adding further complexity for international data transfers, in March 2022, the U.K. adopted its own International Data Transfer Agreement for transfers of personal data out of the U.K. to so-called third countries, as well as an international data transfer addendum that can be used with the SCCs for the same purpose. Moreover, on July 10, 2023 the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision concluding that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the E.U. to the U.S. under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.\nWe are currently self-certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, however such new adequacy decision is likely to face challenge at the Court of Justice of the European Union. While the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework does not apply to the U.K., on October 12, 2023, the U.K. government adopted an adequacy decision concluding that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection transferred from the U.K. to the United States under the U.K. Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\u201cU.K. Data Privacy Framework\u201d). We are currently self-certified under the U.K. Data Privacy\nFramework, and have also self-certified under the Swiss Data Privacy Framework in anticipation of a similar adequacy decision from the Swiss government. Both the U.K. and Swiss Data Privacy Frameworks could also be contested or otherwise affected by any challenges to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. Certain countries outside Europe (including Russia, China and Brazil) have also passed or are considering laws requiring local data residency or otherwise impeding the transfer of personal data across borders, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. If we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border data transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from Europe or other foreign jurisdictions. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations; limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to such cross-border data transfer or localization laws; or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities and infrastructure in foreign jurisdictions at significant expense.\nIn addition to the GDPR, other European legislative proposals and present laws and regulations apply to cookies and similar tracking technologies, electronic communications, and marketing. In the E.E.A. and the U.K., regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem. For example, it is anticipated that the ePrivacy Regulation, which is still being negotiated, and national implementing laws will replace the current national laws implementing the ePrivacy Directive. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to make significant operational changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, and subject us to liabilities.\nIn addition to government regulation, we may be contractually subject to industry standards adopted by privacy advocates and industry groups and may become subject to such obligations in the future. We may also be bound by other contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful.\nFurther, because data privacy and security are critical competitive factors in our industry, we publish privacy policies and other documentation regarding our collection, use, disclosure and other processing of personal data and other confidential information. Although we endeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications and documentation, we may at times fail to do so, may be perceived to have failed to do so, or be alleged to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees or vendors fail to comply with our published policies, certifications and documentation. The publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Should any of these statements prove to be untrue or be perceived as untrue, even if because of circumstances beyond our reasonable control, we may face litigation, disputes, claims, investigations, inquiries or other proceedings by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, federal, state and foreign regulators, our customers and private litigants, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws, regulations, rules, standards and other obligations are still uncertain and likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, it is possible that these laws, regulations, rules, standards and other actual or alleged obligations, including contractual or self-regulatory obligations, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our software. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which we may be unable to do in a commercially reasonable manner or at all and which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address data privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or the failure, or perceived failure, to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws, regulations, rules, standards, contractual obligations, policies and other actual or alleged obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, rules, standards, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our software. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our software particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nOur market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on third-party assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The market in which we compete may not meet these size estimates and may not achieve these growth forecasts. Even if the market in which we compete meets such size estimates and the growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all, for a variety of reasons, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe could incur substantial costs in obtaining, maintaining, protecting, defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights and any failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our software and brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property rights. As of January 31, 2024, we had 77 issued patents and 35 pending patent applications in the United States. Patent applications may not result in issued patents and even if a patent issues, we cannot assure you that such patent will be adequate to protect our business. In addition to patent protection, we primarily rely on copyright and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or other contractual arrangements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate and we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating, our intellectual property rights. In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to establish, monitor and enforce such rights. Litigation brought to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Additionally, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. An adverse determination of any litigation proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated, interpreted narrowly or held unenforceable and could put our related intellectual property at risk of not issuing or being canceled. The local laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and effective intellectual property protection and mechanisms may not be available in those jurisdictions. We may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property in these countries and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. Our patent applications and patents arising from any patent applications we may file in the future may never be granted and, even if we are successful in obtaining effective protection, it is expensive to maintain these rights, both in terms of application and maintenance costs, and the time and cost required to defend our rights could be substantial. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may be unable to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if we are able to secure our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurances that such rights will provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology.\nIn addition, we regularly contribute source code under open source licenses and have made some of our own software available under open source or source available licenses and we include third-party open source software in our products. Because the source code for any software we contribute to open source projects or distribute under open source or source available licenses is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such source code may be limited or lost entirely. In addition, from time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the software or derivative works that we have developed using third-party open source software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open-source license. See \u201c-Our software incorporates third-party open source software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.\u201d\nWe have been and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which may be costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nCompanies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims that we have misappropriated, misused, infringed or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of our competitors, non-practicing entities or other third parties. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that our software incorporates\nthird-party open source software. For example, Realtime Data (\u201cRealtime\u201d) filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in March 2019 alleging that we are infringing three U.S. patents that it holds: the 908 Patent, the 751 Patent and the 825 Patent. See \u201cPart I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Form 10-K.\u201d\nAny intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming and expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, some of which we have invested considerable effort and time to bring to market. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any aspect of our business that may ultimately be determined to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of another party, we could be forced to limit or stop sales of subscriptions to our software and may be unable to compete effectively. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that such personnel have divulged proprietary or other confidential information to us. Further, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our products, and our insurance may not cover intellectual property rights infringement claims that may be made. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our partners, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn addition to our direct sales force and our website, we use strategic partners, such as global system integrators, value-added resellers and independent software vendors to sell our subscription offerings and related services. Our agreements with our partners are generally nonexclusive, meaning our partners may offer their customers products and services of several different companies, including products and services that compete with ours, or may themselves be or become competitors. If our partners do not effectively market and sell our subscription offerings and related services, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own products and services or those of our competitors, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell our subscription offerings and related services may be harmed. Our partners may cease marketing our subscription offerings or related services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional partners could harm our growth objectives and results of operations.\nWe rely upon third-party cloud providers to host our cloud offering; any disruption of or interference with our use of third-party cloud providers would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe outsource substantially all of the infrastructure relating to MongoDB Atlas across AWS, Microsoft Azure and GCP to host our cloud offering. If the hosting of MongoDB Atlas is disrupted or interfered with for any reason, our business would be negatively impacted. Customers of MongoDB Atlas need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance and we provide them with service level commitments with respect to uptime. Third-party cloud providers run their own platforms that we access and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service interruptions. We may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our third-party cloud providers\u2019 infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, cyberattacks, or security breaches or other security incidents that we cannot predict or prevent. Such interruptions, delays or outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of credits to our cloud offering customers, which may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we or any of these third-party cloud providers, experience a security breach or other security incident, our software is unavailable or our customers are unable to use our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It is possible that our customers and potential customers would hold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a third-party cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure and we may incur significant liability from those customers and from third parties with respect to any breach affecting these systems. We may not be able to recover a material portion of our liabilities to our customers and third parties from a third-party cloud provider. It may also become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as our software becomes more complex and the usage of our software increases. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInterruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing customers and new customers to access our software at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. We may experience service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes or failures, human or software errors, malicious acts, terrorism, security breaches or other security incidents, or capacity constraints. Capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, cyberattacks, data breaches or other security incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify and/or remedy the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance as our software offerings and customer implementations become more complex. If our software is unavailable or if our customers are unable to access features of our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, or if other performance problems occur, our business, results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected.\nIncorrect or improper implementation or use of our software could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nOur database software and related services are designed to be deployed in a wide variety of technology environments, including in large-scale, complex technology environments and we believe our future success will depend at least, in part, on our ability to support such deployments. Implementations of our software may be technically complicated and it may not be easy to maximize the value of our software without proper implementation and training. For example, industry publications have reported ransomware attacks on MongoDB instances. We believe these attacks were successful due to the failure by users of our Community Server offering to properly turn on the recommended security settings when running these instances. If our customers are unable to implement our software successfully, or in a timely manner, customer perceptions of our company and our software may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer and customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions or increase their purchases of our related services.\nOur customers and partners need regular training in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from our software to maximize its potential. We often work with our customers to achieve successful implementations, particularly for large, complex deployments. Our failure to train customers on how to efficiently and effectively deploy and use our software, or our failure to provide effective support or professional services to our customers, whether actual or perceived, may result in negative publicity or legal actions against us. Also, as we continue to expand our customer base, any actual or perceived failure by us to properly provide these services will likely result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales of our related services.\nIf we fail to meet our service level commitments, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur agreements with customers typically provide for service level commitments. Our MongoDB Enterprise Advanced customers typically get service level commitments with certain guaranteed response times and comprehensive 24x365 coverage. Our MongoDB Atlas customers typically get monthly uptime service level commitments, where we are required to provide a service credit for any extended periods of downtime. The complexity and quality of our customer\u2019s implementation and the performance and availability of cloud services and cloud infrastructure are outside our control and, therefore, we are not in full control of whether we can meet these service level commitments. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to meet our service level commitments for any reason. Any extended service outages could adversely affect our business, reputation and brand.\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel, including senior management and our engineering, professional services, sales and technology professionals; if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our senior management team, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, and our highly skilled team members, including our sales personnel, customer-facing technical personnel and software engineers.\nWe do not maintain key man insurance on any of our executive officers or key employees. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the termination or departure of our executive officers and key employees. The majority of our senior management and key employees are employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of any of our senior management or key employees\ncould adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts they have undertaken to execute our business plan and to execute against our market opportunity. We may not be able to find adequate replacements. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees.\nFurther, if members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and/or our operations may be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to successfully pursue our growth strategy and compete effectively also depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain our personnel. Competition for well-qualified employees in all aspects of our business, including sales personnel, customer-facing technical personnel and software engineers, is intense, and it may be even more challenging to retain qualified personnel as many companies have moved to offer a remote or hybrid work environment, and considering the current period of heightened employee attrition in the United States and other countries. Our recruiting efforts focus on elite organizations and our primary recruiting competition are well-known, high-paying technology companies. In response to competition, rising inflation rates and labor shortages, we may need to adjust employee compensation, which could affect our operating costs and margins, as well as potentially cause dilution to existing stockholders. We may also lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, especially among developers, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand, especially with developers, in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our software and attracting new customers. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. For instance, our continued focus and investment in MongoDB .local events, MongoDB University and similar investments in our brand and customer engagement and education may not generate a sufficient financial return. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or continue to incur substantial expenses, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our platform.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot continue to maintain and develop this culture as we grow and evolve, we may be unable to execute effectively and could lose the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit we have worked hard to foster, which could harm our business.\nWe believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. Our workforce has increased significantly from January 31, 2017 and we expect to continue to hire as we expand, especially among research and development and sales and marketing personnel. Such headcount growth may result in a change to our corporate culture.\nOur leadership team also plays a key role in our corporate culture. We may recruit and hire other senior executives in the future. Such management changes subject us to a number of risks, such as risks pertaining to coordination of responsibilities and tasks, creation of new management systems and processes, differences in management style, any of which could adversely impact our corporate culture. In addition, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic.\nIf we do not continue to maintain and develop our corporate culture, we may be unable to execute effectively and foster the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit we believe we need to support our growth, which could harm our business.\nWe depend and rely upon SaaS technologies from third parties to operate our business and interruptions or performance problems with these technologies may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on hosted SaaS applications from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including enterprise resource planning, order management, contract management billing, project management and accounting and other operational activities. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages, interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted and our processes for managing sales of our platform and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements could expose us to substantial liability for data breaches, intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, security breaches or other security incidents, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.\nBecause our long-term growth strategy involves sales to customers outside the United States, our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived internationally and we are susceptible to risks related to our international operations. In the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total revenue generated from customers outside the United States was 46%, 45% and 46%, respectively, of our total revenue. We currently have international offices outside of North America in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d), the Asia-Pacific region and South America, focusing primarily on selling our products and services in those regions. In addition, we expanded our reach in China in February 2021 when we announced a global partnership with Tencent Cloud that allows customers to easily adopt and use MongoDB-as-a-Service across Tencent\u2019s global cloud infrastructure. In the future, we may continue to expand our presence in these regions or expand into other international locations. Our current international operations and future initiatives involve a variety of risks, including risks associated with:\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u2022the need to adapt and localize our products for specific countries;\n\u2022greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;\n\u2022unexpected changes in laws, regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws;\n\u2022shelter-in-place, occupancy limitations or similar orders, private travel limitation, or business disruption in regions affecting our operations, stemming from actual, imminent or perceived outbreak of contagious disease;\n\u2022more stringent regulations relating to data privacy and security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal data, particularly in EMEA;\n\u2022differing labor regulations, especially in EMEA, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;\n\u2022challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\n\u2022difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;\n\u2022increased costs associated with international operations, including travel, real estate, infrastructure and legal compliance costs;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;\n\u2022the effect of other economic factors, including inflation, pricing and currency devaluation;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n\u2022laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors;\n\u2022operating in new, developing or other markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations, including relating to contract and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022political instability, including any escalation in the geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan, social unrest, terrorist activities, acts of civil or international hostility, such as the current military conflict and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, natural disasters or regional or global outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and\n\u2022adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers, could limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers and certain markets, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to sell our offerings in certain countries. For instance, there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes. If tariffs or other trade barriers are placed on offerings such as ours, this could have a direct or indirect adverse effect on our business. Even in the absence of tariffs or other trade barriers, the related uncertainty and the market's fears relating to international trade might result in lower demand for our offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, our financial results, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Often, contracts executed by our foreign operations are denominated in the currency of that country or region and a portion of our revenue is therefore subject to foreign currency risks. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our subscription offerings and related services to our customers outside of the United States, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of such expenses being higher. This could have a negative impact on our reported results of operations. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies and any such strategies, such as forward contracts, options and foreign exchange swaps related to transaction exposures that we may implement in the future to mitigate this risk may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our software and could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe future success of our business and particularly our cloud offerings, such as MongoDB Atlas, depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our software in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of internet-related commerce or communications generally, resulting in reductions in the demand for internet-based solutions such as ours.\nIn addition, the use of the internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility and quality of service. The performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool have been adversely affected by a variety of evolving data security threats and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our subscription offerings and related services could suffer.\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations.\nBased on our current corporate structure, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. The authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns or require us to file tax returns in jurisdictions in which we are not currently filing and could impose additional tax, interest and penalties. In addition, the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries, assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, or challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing. The relevant taxing authorities may determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If such a disagreement was to occur and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes and interest and penalties. Any increase in the amount of taxes we pay or that are imposed on us could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may expand through acquisitions or investments in strategic partnerships, each of which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations, and harm our results of operations.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may choose to do so through acquisitions or investments in strategic partnerships, rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions.\nThe risks we face in connection with any acquisitions or strategic investments include:\n\u2022the potential of incurring charges or assuming substantial debt or other liabilities, which may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, and which may expose us to claims and disputes by stockholders and third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or which may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition or strategic investment;\n\u2022we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel or operations of any company that we acquire or invest in, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us;\n\u2022we may not be able to realize anticipated synergies;\n\u2022an acquisition or strategic investment may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management;\n\u2022an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company and we may experience increased customer churn with respect to the company acquired;\n\u2022we may encounter challenges integrating the employees of the acquired company into our company culture;\n\u2022for international transactions, we may face additional challenges related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022we may be unable to successfully sell any acquired products or increase adoption or usage of acquired products, or increase spend by acquired customers;\n\u2022our use of cash to pay for acquisitions or strategic investment would limit other potential uses for our cash;\n\u2022if we incur debt to fund any acquisitions, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, including financial maintenance covenants; and\n\u2022if we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our non-marketable securities, including partial or complete loss of invested capital. Significant changes in the fair value of our private investment portfolio could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe have non-marketable equity securities in privately-held companies. The financial success of our investments in any privately-held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. In addition, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.\nWe record all fair value adjustments of our non-marketable securities through the consolidated statements of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our non-marketable securities. Our ability to mitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period of time. All of our investments, especially our non-marketable securities, are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. Changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies could be material to our financial statements and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. Travel Act, the U.K. Bribery Act (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d) and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions around the world. The FCPA, Bribery Act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies, their officers, directors, employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, resellers and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures and internal controls to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. To the extent that we learn that any of our employees, third-party intermediaries, agents, or business partners do not adhere to our policies, procedures, or internal controls, we are committed to taking appropriate remedial action. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our directors, officers, employees, third-party intermediaries, agents, or business partners have or may have violated such laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time, resources and attention from senior management. Any violation of the FCPA, Bribery Act, or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, fines and penalties or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects and financial condition.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For example, SEC proposals on\nclimate-related disclosures may require us to update our accounting or operational policies, processes, or systems to reflect new or amended financial reporting standards. Such changes may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, the incremental borrowing rate related to our lease liabilities, stock-based compensation, fair value of the liability component of the convertible debt, fair value of common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants prior to the initial public offering, legal contingencies, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment and accounting for income taxes. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one\nor more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nWe may require additional capital to support our operations or the growth of our business and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or otherwise enhance our database software, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to secure additional capital through equity or debt financings. If we raise additional capital, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms that are satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired and our business may be harmed.\nWe are a multinational organization with a distributed workforce facing increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.\nAs a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly new and complex tax laws, the amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. Additionally, the rise of flexible work policies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue to increase the complexity of our payroll tax practices and may lead to challenges with our payments to tax authorities. Furthermore, authorities in the many jurisdictions in which we operate or have employees could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of certain tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to the expansion of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may impact our evidence supporting a full valuation allowance or increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nPotential tax reform globally and in the United States may result in significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law, including changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of corporations (including ours) and/or changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of stockholders in U.S. corporations, including investors in our common stock. For example, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax law. Additional significant changes to U.S. federal corporate tax law were made by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, and the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act (\u201cIRA\u201d). The Company has determined that it is not currently subject to the tax effects of the IRA, which includes a corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax on stock buybacks. In addition, the E.U. member states formally adopted the EU\u2019s Pillar Two Directive, which was established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). Pillar Two generally imposes a 15 percent minimum effective tax rate in the jurisdictions where multinational enterprises operate and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. While the Company does not anticipate that this will have a material impact on its\ntax provision or effective tax rate in the short-term, the Company continues to monitor evolving tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nWe continue to monitor the progression of new global and U.S. legislation impact on our effective tax rate. We are currently unable to predict whether any future changes will occur and, if so, the impact of such changes, including on the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of January 31, 2024, we had net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards for U.S. federal and state, Irish and U.K. income tax purposes. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs before they expire. In general, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (as defined under Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We may experience a future ownership change under Section 382 of the Code that could affect our ability to utilize the NOLs to offset our income. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities, including for state tax purposes.\nFor these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales and we believe that such taxes are not applicable to our products and services in certain jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our end-customers for the past amounts and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our end-customers, we could be held liable for such costs. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest, or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.\nOur offerings are subject to U.S. export controls and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our offerings. These encryption offerings and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license.\nFurthermore, our activities are subject to the economic sanctions laws and regulations by the U.S. and other jurisdictions that prohibit the shipment of certain products and services without the required export authorizations or export to countries, governments and persons targeted by the sanctions. While we take precautions to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations for our encryption offerings, implementing IP address blocking and screenings against U.S. Government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws.\nWe also note that if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties. We presently incorporate export control compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nIf we fail to comply with U.S. and other sanctions and export control laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import, export and sale of certain encryption and other technology, including permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our offerings or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our offerings in those countries. Changes in our offerings or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our offerings in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our offerings globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our offerings to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our offerings by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our offerings to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our offerings or limitation on our ability to export or sell our offerings would likely adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods, pandemics and public health emergencies and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions,security breaches or other security incidents, or terrorism.\nAs of January 31, 2024, we have customers in over 100 countries and employees in over 25 countries. A significant natural disaster or man-made problem, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, an act of terrorism, the regional or global outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other catastrophic event occurring in any of these locations, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, if a natural disaster or man-made problem were to affect data centers used by our cloud infrastructure service providers this could adversely affect the ability of our customers to use our products. In addition, natural disasters, regional or global outbreaks of contagious diseases and acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 businesses, national economies or the world economy as a whole. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact consumer and business spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our operating results. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the precautionary measures that we, our customers, and the governmental authorities adopted resulted in operational challenges, including, among other things, adapting to new work-from-home arrangements. More generally, a catastrophic event could adversely affect economies and financial markets globally and lead to an economic downturn, which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our products and services. Any prolonged economic downturn or a recession could materially harm our business and operating results and those of our customers, could result in business closures, layoffs, or furloughs of, or reductions in the number of hours worked by, our and our customer's employees, and a significant increase in unemployment in the United States and elsewhere. Such events may also lead to a reduction in the capital and operating budgets that we or our customers have available, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. As we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the trading prices for our and other technology companies' common stock may be highly volatile as a result of a catastrophic event, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. In the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, data breaches or other security incidents and loss of critical data, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, data security threats have become more prevalent, we face increased risk from these activities to maintain the performance, reliability, security and availability of our subscription offerings and related services and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our customers, which may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.\nTo the extent any of the above or similar events occur and adversely affect our business and results of operations, such event may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to our environmental, social, and governance activities and disclosures.\nWe are in the process of developing our sustainability initiatives. The implementation of such initiatives may require considerable investment and if these initiatives are not perceived to be adequate, or if the positions we take (or choose not to take) on social and ethical issues are unpopular with some of our employees, partners, or with our customers or potential customers, our reputation could be harmed, which could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain employees, partners or customers.\nIn addition, there is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, both in the United States and internationally. We communicate\ncertain ESG-related initiatives and goals regarding environmental matters, diversity and other matters in our annually released Corporate Sustainability Report, on our website and elsewhere. Any of our current or future initiatives, goals and commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our ESG-related initiatives, goals and commitments. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals and commitments, or for any revisions to them.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that our reporting frameworks and principles will be in compliance with any new environmental and social laws and regulations that may be promulgated in the United States and elsewhere, and the costs of changing any of our current practices to comply with any new legal and regulatory requirements in the United States and elsewhere may be substantial. Furthermore, industry and market practices may further develop to become even more robust than what is required under any new laws and regulations, and we may have to expend significant efforts and resources to keep up with market trends and stay competitive among our peers.\nSocial, ethical, security and regulatory issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our offerings or partnerships may result in reputational harm and liability.\nSocial, ethical, security and regulatory issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as AI, including generative AI, in our offerings or partnerships, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. No assurance can be provided that our use of AI will enhance our products or services or produce the intended results. For example, AI algorithms may be flawed, insufficient, of poor quality, reflect unwanted forms of bias, or contain other errors or inadequacies, any of which may not be easily detectable and AI, particularly generative AI, has been known to produce false or \u201challucinatory\u201d inferences or outputs. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Potential government regulation related to AI use and ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, and failure to properly remediate AI usage or ethics issues may cause public confidence in AI to be undermined. AI and machine learning may change the way our industry identifies and responds to cybersecurity threats, and businesses that are slow to adopt or fail to adopt such new technologies may face a competitive disadvantage. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain any potential offerings or partnerships to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact.\nIn addition, the use of AI may enhance intellectual property, cybersecurity, operational and technological risks. As the regulatory framework for AI and related technologies evolves, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted, or that existing laws and regulations, including intellectual property, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, consumer protection, competition and equal opportunity laws and regulations, may be interpreted in ways that would affect our business and the ways in which we or our partners use AI or related technologies, our financial condition and our results of operations, including as a result of the cost to comply with such laws or regulations. For example, if we or our third-party AI providers do not have sufficient rights to use the data or other material or content on which AI tools rely, or the output generated by our use of such AI tools, we may incur liability through the violation of such laws, third-party intellectual property, privacy or other rights, or contracts to which we are a party. Moreover, use of generative AI in our code development process, while offering various potential benefits, could also pose certain ownership and security risks with respect to our codebase, given the current legal uncertainties relating to ownership of AI-generated works and the potential for security flaws in output code. Further, potential government regulation related to AI use and ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, and failure to properly remediate AI usage or ethics issues may cause public confidence in AI to be undermined, which could slow adoption of AI in our products and services. In particular, we are monitoring the development of EU AI Act, which was approved in a political agreement in December 2023. We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our operations or offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. Furthermore, because AI technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks that may arise relating to the use of AI.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nTechnology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022whether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022announcements of new products or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in how customers perceive the benefits of our product and future product offerings and releases;\n\u2022departures of key personnel;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u2022changes in actual or future expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022significant data breach or other security incident involving our software;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u2022regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022general economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets; and\n\u2022\u201cflash crashes,\u201d \u201cfreeze flashes\u201d or other glitches that disrupt trading on the securities exchange on which we are listed.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.\nWe release earnings guidance in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls, quarterly and annual earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance includes forward-looking statements based on projections prepared by our management. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies on our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. Some of those key assumptions relate to the macroeconomic environment, including inflation and interest rates, which are inherently difficult to predict. We intend to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including due to the global economic uncertainty and financial market volatility, instability in the banking sector, the ongoing geopolitical instability resulting from the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability, any of which or combination thereof could materially and adversely affect our business and future operating results. Furthermore, if we make downward\nrevisions of our previously announced guidance, if we withdraw our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our common stock would decline.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this report could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, investors in our common stock may only receive a return if the market price of our common stock increases.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management's attention and affect our ability to attract and retain additional executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and their application in practice may evolve over time as regulatory and governing bodies issue revisions to, or new interpretations of, these public company requirements. Such changes could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher legal and financial costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We will continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nBeing a public company under these rules and regulations has made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and in the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers or members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees.\nAs a result of the disclosures within our filings with the SEC, information about our business and our financial condition is available to competitors and other third parties, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions.\nDelaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors who are not nominated by the current members of our Board of Directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022a classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our Board of Directors, the chairperson of our Board of Directors or our chief executive officer, which limitations could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business (including our classified board structure) or certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws, which may allow our Board of Directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a specified period of time.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, we have options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of shares of our common stock. We also have restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) outstanding that, if vested and settled, would result in the issuance of shares of common stock. All of the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, are registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to applicable vesting requirements.\nFurthermore, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the 2026 Notes (as defined below). If we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation on the 2026 Notes solely in shares of our common stock upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, we will be required to deliver shares of our common stock, together with cash for any fractional share.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding Notes\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our substantial debt when due.\nIn June and July 2018, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d), which were redeemed on December 3, 2021, in a private placement and in January 2020, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d and, together with the 2024 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d) in a private placement and concurrently repurchased for cash approximately $210.0 million of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes.\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Our business may not be able to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more\nalternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn addition, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt agreements, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indentures governing the 2026 Notes, from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt, repurchasing our stock, pledging our assets, making investments, paying dividends, guaranteeing debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. Additionally, weakness and volatility in capital markets and the economy, in general or as a result of macroeconomic conditions such as rising inflation, could limit our access to capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2026 Notes will be entitled to convert their 2026 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. We also may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time the 2026 Notes mature. Our failure to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2026 Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture for the 2026 Notes. In addition, even if holders of 2026 Notes do not elect to convert their 2026 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2026 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes was triggered during the three months ended January 31, 2024, as the last reported sale price of our common stock was more than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on January 31, 2024 (the last trading day of the fiscal quarter). Therefore, the 2026 Notes are currently convertible at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part, from February 1, 2024 through April 30, 2024. Whether the 2026 Notes will be convertible following such fiscal quarter will depend on the continued satisfaction of this condition or another conversion condition in the future.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the 2026 Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2026 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2026 Notes. The capped call transactions are expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 2026 Notes. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the counterparties or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the 2026 Notes, including with certain investors in the 2026 Notes.\nThe counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2026 Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, which are scheduled to occur during the observation period relating to any conversion of the 2026 Notes on or after October 15, 2025), or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversions of the 2026 Notes or otherwise. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of shares of our common stock.",

Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management\nAt MongoDB, cybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall information security program, which we review and update at least annually to reflect changes to our organization, business practices, technology and services, and applicable legislation and regulations. Our information security program is designed to align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and provides a framework for handling cybersecurity threats and incidents, including threats and incidents associated with the use of services provided by third parties. This framework includes steps for assessing the severity of a cybersecurity threat or incident, identifying the source of a cybersecurity threat or incident including whether the cybersecurity threat or incident is associated with a third-party service provider, implementing cybersecurity countermeasures and mitigation strategies and informing management and our board of directors of material cybersecurity threats and incidents. In addition, our information security team provides ongoing education to and requires mandatory training at least once annually of all employees. To bolster the security of our products and services, we have appropriate technical and organizational measures in place to protect data that our customers upload to MongoDB Atlas, which is certified against ISO 27001:2013, ISO 27017:2015, ISO 27018:2019, SOC 2 Type II, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard v.4, and Cloud Security Alliance (\u201cCSA\u201d) Security, Trust, Assurance, Information Security Registered Assessors Program and Risk (\u201cSTAR\u201d) Level 2. We also engage third parties to perform annual audits of our standards-based certifications and we have undergone a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act examination validated by a qualified third-party assessor.\nGovernance\nOur board of directors has overall oversight responsibility for our enterprise risk management, and delegates cybersecurity risk management oversight to its Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that management has processes in place designed to identify and assess cybersecurity risks to which the Company is exposed and implement processes and programs designed to manage cybersecurity risks, including mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents. In addition, on a quarterly basis, certain members of our board of directors meet with our Chief Information Security Officer, (\u201cCISO\u201d), and other senior executives to perform more in-depth reviews of the Company\u2019s cybersecurity programs, as well as relevant cybersecurity risks and mitigation strategies and report back to the Audit Committee regarding the matters reviewed. Ahead of each such quarterly meeting, management, including the CISO and our information security team, prepares and provides cybersecurity reports that cover, among other topics, developments in cybersecurity and updates to the company\u2019s cybersecurity programs and mitigation strategies, legislative developments affecting MongoDB's information security program, and notable security incidents and investigations. The Audit Committee subsequently reports material cybersecurity matters to our full board of directors. In addition, our management follows a risk-based escalation process to notify the Audit Committee outside of the regular reporting cycle when they identify an emerging cybersecurity risk.\nOur cybersecurity programs are under the direction of our CISO, who receives reports from our information security team and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Our CISO and dedicated security leaders are certified and experienced information systems security professionals and information security managers each with well over a decade of experience. Our CISO and information security team, along with our management, are responsible for identifying, considering and assessing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures and maintaining our cybersecurity programs.\nDespite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident.

Our business model combines the developer mindshare and adoption benefits of open source with the economic benefits of a proprietary software subscription business model.\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions, which accounted for 97% of our total revenue for the year ended January 31, 2024 and 96% of our total revenue for the each of the years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nMongoDB Atlas is our hosted multi-cloud database-as-a-service (\u201cDBaaS\u201d) offering, which we run and manage in the cloud, and includes comprehensive infrastructure and management, as well as a host of additional features, such as MongoDB Atlas Search, Vector search, time series and application-driven analytics. During the year ended January 31, 2024, MongoDB Atlas revenue represented 66% of our total revenue, as compared to 63% in the prior year, reflecting the continued growth of MongoDB Atlas since its introduction in June 2016. We have experienced strong growth in self-serve customers of MongoDB Atlas, which are charged monthly in arrears based on their usage. We have also seen growth in MongoDB Atlas customers sold by our sales force, which typically sign annual contracts and pay in advance or are invoiced monthly in arrears based on usage. Customers sold by our sales force may also sign contracts that remain in effect until terminated and are invoiced monthly in arrears based on usage. We expect to continue to see a higher portion of our MongoDB Atlas contracts to be billed monthly in arrears based on usage without requiring upfront commitments.\nMongoDB Enterprise Advanced is our proprietary commercial database server offering for enterprise customers that can run in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment. MongoDB Enterprise Advanced revenue represented 26%, 29% and 35% of our subscription revenue for the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We sell subscriptions directly through our field and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through channel partners. The majority of our subscription contracts are one year in duration and are invoiced upfront. When we enter into multi-year subscriptions, the customer is typically invoiced on an annual basis or pays upfront.\nMany of our enterprise customers initially get to know our software by using Community Server, which is our free-to-download version of our database that includes the core functionality developers need to get started with MongoDB without all the features of our commercial platform. Our platform has been downloaded from our website more than 500 million times since February 2009. We also offer a free tier of MongoDB Atlas, which provides access to our hosted database solution with limited processing power and storage, as well as certain operational limitations. As a result, with the availability of both Community Server and MongoDB Atlas free tier offerings, our direct sales prospects are often familiar with our platform and may have already built applications using our technology. A core component of our growth strategy for MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced is to convert developers and their organizations who are already using Community Server or the free tier of MongoDB Atlas to become customers of our commercial products and enjoy the benefits of either a self-managed or hosted offering.\nWe also generate revenue from services, which consist primarily of fees associated with consulting and training services. Revenue from services accounted for 3% of our total revenue for the year ended January 31, 2024 and 4% of our total revenue for each of the years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in our services organization as we believe it plays an important role in accelerating our customers\u2019 realization of the benefits of our platform, which helps drive customer retention and expansion.\nWe believe the market for our offerings is large and growing. We have experienced rapid growth and have made substantial investments in developing our platform and expanding our sales and marketing footprint. We intend to continue to invest to grow our business to take advantage of our market opportunity.\nMacroeconomic and Other Factors\nOur operational and financial performance is subject to risks including those caused by the adverse macroeconomic environment and the geopolitical landscape.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions include slower or negative economic growth, higher inflation and higher interest rates. During the year ended January 31, 2024, the macroeconomic environment negatively impacted our business. For instance, we experienced slower than historical growth rates for our existing MongoDB Atlas applications. While the impact of these macroeconomic conditions on our business, results of operations and financial position remain uncertain over the long term, we expect to experience macroeconomic headwinds on growth rate for our existing MongoDB Atlas applications in the short term.\nWe continue to monitor the developments of the macroeconomic environment and the geopolitical landscape. As these factors develop and we evaluate their impact on our business, we may adjust our business practices accordingly. For further discussion of the potential impacts of these factors on our business, operating results, and financial condition, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Other factors affecting our performance are discussed below.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nExtending Product Leadership and Maintaining Developer Mindshare\nWe are committed to delivering market-leading products to continue to build and maintain credibility with the global software developer community. We believe we must maintain our product leadership position and the strength of our brand to drive further revenue growth. We intend to continue to invest in our product offerings with the goal of expanding the functionality and adoption of our developer data platform. During 2022, we introduced new features, capabilities and improvements such as column store indexes, in-app analytics, Atlas Serverless and Atlas Device Sync, allowing developer teams to accomplish more over a wider range of workloads. With Queryable Encryption, we pioneered the industry\u2019s first encrypted search scheme using breakthrough cryptography engineering. During 2023, we added additional capabilities such as Atlas Vector Search and Atlas Stream Processing, as well as additional features for Atlas Search Nodes, which now provide dedicated infrastructure for search use cases so customers can scale independently of their database to manage their workloads with greater flexibility and operational efficiency.\nWe intend to continue to invest in our engineering capabilities and marketing activities to maintain our strong position in the developer community. We have spent $1.9 billion on research and development since our inception. Our results of operations may fluctuate as we make these investments to drive increased customer adoption and usage.\nGrowing Our Customer Base and Expanding Our Global Reach\nWe are intensely focused on continuing to grow our customer base. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our sales and marketing efforts and developer community outreach, which are critical to driving customer acquisition. As of January 31, 2024, we had over 47,800 customers across a wide range of industries and in over 100 countries, compared to over 40,800 customers and over 33,000 customers as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All affiliated entities are counted as a single customer and our definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d excludes users of our free offerings.\nAs of January 31, 2024, we had over 7,000 customers that were sold through our direct sales force and channel partners, as compared to over 6,400 and over 4,400 such customers as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These customers, which we refer to as our Direct Sales Customers, accounted for 88%, 87% and 85% of our subscription revenue for the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The percentage of our subscription revenue from Direct Sales Customers increased, in part, due to existing self-serve customers of MongoDB Atlas becoming Direct Sales Customers. We are also focused on increasing the number of overall MongoDB Atlas customers as we emphasize the on-demand scalability of MongoDB Atlas by allowing our customers to consume the product with minimal commitment. We had over 46,300 MongoDB Atlas customers as of January 31, 2024. The growth in MongoDB Atlas customers included new customers to MongoDB and existing MongoDB Enterprise Advanced customers adding incremental MongoDB Atlas workloads.\nRetaining and Expanding Revenue from Existing Customers\nThe economic attractiveness of our subscription-based model is driven by customer renewals and increasing existing customer subscriptions over time, referred to as land-and-expand. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to drive additional sales to existing customers and expect to invest in sales and marketing and customer success personnel and activities to achieve additional revenue growth from existing customers. If an application grows and requires additional capacity, our customers increase their usage of our platform. Growth of an application is impacted by a number of factors including the macroeconomic environment. During the year ended January 31, 2024, we believe we experienced a negative impact from the macroeconomic environment on the growth of existing Atlas applications, which affected our revenue growth. We expect the macroeconomic environment to continue to negatively impact our revenue growth. In addition, our customers add incremental workloads or expand their subscriptions to our platform as they migrate additional existing applications or build new applications, either within the same department or in other lines of business or geographies. Also, as customers modernize their information technology infrastructure and move to the cloud, they may migrate applications from legacy databases. Our goal is to increase the number of customers that standardize on our platform within their organization, as well as add new workloads with new and existing customers. Over time, the subscription amount for our typical Direct Sales Customer has increased.\nWe calculate annualized recurring revenue (\u201cARR\u201d) and annualized monthly recurring revenue (\u201cMRR\u201d) to help us measure our subscription revenue performance. ARR includes the revenue we expect to receive from our customers over the following 12 months based on contractual commitments and, in the case of Direct Sales Customers of MongoDB Atlas, by annualizing the prior 90 days of their actual usage of MongoDB Atlas, assuming no increases or reductions in their subscriptions or usage. For all other customers of our self-serve products, we calculate annualized MRR by annualizing the prior 30 days of their actual usage of such products, assuming no increases or reductions in usage. ARR and annualized MRR exclude professional services. The number of customers with $100,000 or greater in ARR and annualized MRR was 2,052, 1,651 and 1,307 as of January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including customers\u2019 satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products and services, competition, pricing, economic conditions or overall changes in our customers\u2019 spending levels.\nWe also examine the rate at which our customers increase their spend with us, which we call net ARR expansion rate. We calculate net ARR expansion rate by dividing the ARR at the close of a given period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d), from customers who were also customers at the close of the same period in the prior year (the \u201cbase period\u201d), by the ARR from all customers at the close of the base period, including those who churned or reduced their subscriptions. For Direct Sales Customers included in the base period, measurement period or both such periods that were self-serve customers in any such period, we also include annualized MRR from those customers in the calculation of the net ARR expansion rate. Our net ARR expansion rate has consistently been over 120%, demonstrating our ability to expand within existing customers.\nOur ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including customers\u2019 satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products and services, competition, pricing, economic conditions or overall changes in our customers\u2019 spending levels.\nInvesting in Growth and Scaling Our Business\nWe are focused on our long-term revenue potential. We believe that our market opportunity is large and we will continue to invest in scaling across all organizational functions in order to grow our operations both domestically and internationally. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization will occur in advance of experiencing the benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating resources in those areas. We have increased our sales and marketing headcount to 2,338 employees as of January 31, 2024 from 2,249 employees and 1,713 employees as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nSubscription Revenue. Our subscription revenue is comprised of term licenses and hosted as-a-service solutions. Revenue from our MongoDB Atlas offering is primarily generated on a usage basis and is billed either monthly in arrears or paid upfront. Subscriptions to term licenses include technical support and access to new software versions on a when-and-if available basis. Revenue from our term licenses is recognized upfront for the license component and ratably for the technical support and when-and-if available update components. Associated contracts are typically billed annually in advance. The majority of our subscription contracts are one year in duration. When we enter into multi-year subscriptions, the customer is\ntypically invoiced on an annual basis or pays upfront. Our subscription contracts are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable.\nServices Revenue. Services revenue is comprised of consulting and training services and is recognized over the period of delivery of the applicable services. We recognize revenue from services agreements as services are delivered.\nWe expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of new subscriptions, customer usage patterns, the proportion of term license contracts that commence within the period, the rate of customer renewals and expansions, delivery of professional services, the impact of significant transactions and seasonality of or fluctuations in usage from our MongoDB Atlas customers.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Subscription Revenue. Cost of subscription revenue primarily includes third-party cloud infrastructure expenses for our hosted as-a-service solutions. We expect our cost of subscription revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription revenue increases and, depending on the results of MongoDB Atlas, our cost of subscription revenue may increase as a percentage of subscription revenue as well. Cost of subscription revenue also includes personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees associated with our subscription arrangements principally related to technical support and allocated shared costs, as well as depreciation and amortization.\nCost of Services Revenue. Cost of services revenue primarily includes personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees associated with our professional service contracts, as well as, travel costs, allocated shared costs and depreciation and amortization. We expect our cost of services revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our services revenue increases.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross Profit. Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue.\nGross Margin. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our products and services, the mix of products sold, transaction volume growth and the mix of revenue between subscriptions and services. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above and, to the extent MongoDB Atlas revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue, our gross margin may decline as a result of the associated hosting costs of MongoDB Atlas.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include travel and related costs and allocated overhead costs for facilities, information technology and employee benefit costs.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, sales commission and benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. These expenses also include costs related to marketing programs, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, and brand-building and developer-community activities. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars over time as we expand our sales force and increase our marketing resources, expand into new markets and further develop our self-serve and partner channels.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits, and stock-based compensation. It also includes amortization associated with intangible acquired assets and allocated overhead. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars, as we continue to invest in our developer data platform and develop new products.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits, and stock-based compensation for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources and external legal and accounting fees, as well as allocated overhead. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars over time as we continue to invest in the growth of our business, as well as incur the ongoing costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, gains and losses on investments and gains and losses from foreign currency transactions.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As of January 31, 2024, we had net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards for U.S. federal and state, Irish and U.K. income tax purposes of approximately $2.1 billion, $2.0 billion, $781.5 million and $64.6 million, respectively, which begin to expire in the year ending January 31, 2028 for U.S. federal purposes and January 31, 2025 for state purposes. Operating losses in the United States, for years after January 31, 2019, in Ireland and the U.K. may be carried forward indefinitely. The deferred tax assets associated with the NOL carryforwards in each of these jurisdictions are subject to a full valuation allowance. Under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to a limitation on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We also have U.S. federal and state research credit carryforwards of $133.4 million and $11.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in the year ending January 31, 2029 for federal purposes and January 31, 2025 for state purposes. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred. As the result of the new R&D capitalization effective in fiscal year 2023, the capitalized amounts resulted in a decrease of the current year net operating loss. Capitalized R&D expenditures are deductible as amortized in future periods. Therefore, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset for the capitalized R&D expenditures.\nUtilization of the federal NOL carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Code, as amended and similar state provisions. The annual limitation, should we undergo an ownership change, may result in the expiration of U.S. federal or state net operating losses and credits before utilization; however we do not expect any such limitation to be material.\nHighlights for the Years Ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nFor the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our total revenue was $1,683.0 million, $1,284.0 million and $873.8 million, respectively. The increase in total revenue was primarily driven by an increase in subscription revenue from our Direct Sales Customers. Our net loss was $176.6 million, $345.4 million and $306.9 million for the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, driven primarily by higher sales and marketing spend and research and development costs. Our operating cash flow was $121.5 million, $(13.0) million and $7.0 million for the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in U.S. dollars (in thousands) and as a percentage of our total revenue. Percentage of revenue figures are rounded and therefore may not subtotal exactly.\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\nComparison of the Years Ended January 31, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nTotal revenue growth reflects increased demand for our platform and related services. Subscription revenue increased by $392.2 million primarily due to an increase of $357.3 million from our Direct Sales Customers, inclusive of the impact from Direct Sales Customers who were self-serve customers of MongoDB Atlas in the prior-year period. The increase in services revenue was driven primarily by the continued increase in delivery of consulting services.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin Percentage\nThe increase in subscription cost of revenue was primarily due to a $43.5 million increase in third-party cloud infrastructure costs, including costs associated with the growth of MongoDB Atlas. The increase in third-party infrastructure costs was partly offset by continued cost efficiencies realized as we scale MongoDB Atlas. In addition, subscription cost of revenue was higher due to a $15.3 million increase in personnel costs and stock-based compensation associated with increased headcount in our support organization. The increase in services cost of revenue was primarily due to a $11.0 million increase in personnel costs and stock-based compensation associated with headcount in our services organization, and a $2.8 million increase in third-party consultant costs related to the delivery of consulting and training services. Total headcount in our support and services organizations increased 10% from January 31, 2023 to January 31, 2024.\nOur overall gross margin improved to 75%. Our subscription gross margin increased to 79% as efficiencies realized in managing our third-party cloud infrastructure costs more than offset the negative margin impact from the increasing percentage of revenue from MongoDB Atlas. Services gross margin declined due to the impact of higher services personnel costs and stock-based compensation.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nThe increase in sales and marketing expense included $55.9 million from higher personnel costs and stock-based compensation, driven by an increase in our sales and marketing headcount to 2,338 as of January 31, 2024 from 2,249 as of January 31, 2023, which includes non-quota-carrying hires in sales operations, customer success and marketing. Sales and marketing expense also increased $15.3 million due to higher commissions expense, driven in part by the increase in revenue, and $13.7 million due increased marketing spend and higher travel costs. The increase in sales and marketing expense was partly offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in expenditures related to third-party infrastructure costs and professional fees.\nResearch and Development\nThe increase in research and development expense was primarily driven by a $83.9 million increase in personnel costs and stock-based compensation as we increased our research and development headcount by 19%. Research and development\nexpense also increased by $8.8 million due to increased third-party infrastructure costs, higher software expenses and higher amortization expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was due to higher costs to support the growth of our business. In particular, these higher costs were driven by an increase in general and administrative personnel headcount resulting in $29.5 million higher personnel costs and stock-based compensation.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net, for the year ended January 31, 2024 improved primarily due to higher interest income from our short-term investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe increase in the provision for income taxes during the year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in foreign taxes as we continued our global expansion.\nComparison of the Years Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2022, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 17, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totaling $2.0 billion. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of bank deposits and money market funds. Our short-term investments consist of U.S. government treasury securities and our restricted cash represents collateral for our available credit on corporate credit cards. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.\nOn June 29, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an offering price of $365.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $889.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $22.7 million and offering expenses of $0.6 million. Offering expenses included legal, accounting and other fees.\nOn October 1, 2021, we issued a notice of redemption (the \u201cRedemption Notice\u201d) for the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 2024 Notes. We satisfied our conversion obligations with respect to conversions occurring after the date of the Redemption Notice and prior to December 3, 2021 (the \u201cRedemption Date\u201d) by delivering shares of common stock, plus cash in lieu of any resulting fractional shares (physical settlement). Pursuant to the Redemption Notice, on the Redemption Date, we redeemed the outstanding principal of the 2024 Notes that were not converted prior to such date at a redemption\nprice in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Approximately $1.9 million aggregate principal amount outstanding as of October 31, 2021 were converted to 27,377 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock with the remaining balance settled in cash. The extinguishment of the 2024 Notes on December 3, 2021 was immaterial to our financial statements. For further discussion on the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes, please refer to Note 6, Convertible Senior Notes, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.\nWe have generated significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit and historical consolidated statements of cash flows. As of January 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.7 billion. We expect to continue to incur operating losses, may continue to experience negative cash flows from operations in the future and may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business. Our future capital requirements and adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including our growth rate and any impact on it from global macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, inflation, volatility in the banking sector, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operation activities, the timing and size of new subscription introductions and customer usage of our developer data platform, the continuing market acceptance of our subscriptions and services and the impact of the macroeconomic conditions on the global economy and our business, financial condition and results of operations. As the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the global economy and our operations continues to evolve, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended January 31, 2024 was $121.5 million driven primarily by an increase in our cash collections reflecting overall growth of our sales and expansion of our customer base. Our net loss of $176.6 million, included non-cash charges of $456.9 million for stock-based compensation and $18.9 million for depreciation and amortization. Our accrued liabilities increased by $39.5 million reflecting our increase in expenses and timing of payments. Partially offsetting these benefits to our operating cash flow were a decrease in deferred revenue of $82.4 million, accretion of the discount on our short-term investments of $44.6 million and an increase in deferred commissions of $41.8 million, accounts receivable of $41.6 million, driven by continued growth of our sales and our expanding customer base and other net non-cash charges of $6.8 million.\nCash used in operating activities during the year ended January 31, 2023 was $13.0 million. This was primarily driven by our net loss of $345.4 million, which included non-cash charges of $381.5 million for stock-based compensation and $16.1 million for depreciation and amortization. The continuing growth of our sales and our expanding customer base led to an increase in accounts receivable of $91.5 million and deferred commissions of $49.1 million. In addition, accrued liabilities decreased by $16.2 million reflecting lower expenses and timing of payments. These were partly offset by our cash collections, which increased our deferred revenue by $85.8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities during the during the year ended January 31, 2024 was $188.0 million, primarily due to proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $211.1 million, $6.1 million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment and $2.1 million of additional investment in non-marketable securities. In addition, on September 27, 2023, we used $15.0 million of net cash to acquire the assets of Grainite, Inc.\nCash used in investing activities during the during the year ended January 31, 2023 was $33.3 million, primarily due to purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from maturities, of $23.0 million, $7.2 million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment and $3.1 million of additional investment in non-marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2024 was $38.2 million, due to $36.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and $6.8 million exercises of stock options, partly offset by $5.5 million of principal repayments of finance leases.\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2023 was $30.2 million, due to $29.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and $5.7 million exercises of stock options, partly offset by $4.5 million of principal repayments of finance leases.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 31, 2024 (in thousands):\nAt January 31, 2024, our material short-term and long-term cash requirements for various contractual obligations and commitments consisted of the following:\n\u2022principal and future interest payments related to our 2026 Notes;\n\u2022our purchase obligations under non-cancelable agreements for cloud infrastructure capacity commitments and subscription and marketing services;\n\u2022our finance and operating lease obligations under non-cancelable leases for office space expiring through 2032; and\n\u2022accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet (primarily short-term in nature).\nFor further details of our contractual obligations and lease agreements, refer to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, within Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K, specifically Note 6, Convertible Senior Notes, Note 7, Leases and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from two sources: (1) the sales of subscriptions, which includes the usage-based database-as-a-service offering and the term license and post-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d); and (2) services revenue comprised of consulting and training arrangements. We recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our agreements, we perform the following steps:\ni.Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer. We contract with our customers through order forms, which are governed by master sales agreements. We determine we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party\u2019s rights regarding the products or services to be transferred is identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, we have determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance. We apply judgment in determining the customer\u2019s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer\u2019s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, reputation and financial or other information pertaining to the customer. At contract inception, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We have concluded that our contracts with customers do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.\nii.Identification of the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services or products that will be transferred to the customer that are both (1) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service or product either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us and (2) distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services or products, we apply judgment to determine whether promised services or products are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised services or products are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\niii.Determination of the transaction price. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services and products to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component.\niv.Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) basis. We also consider if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract and if so, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to such rights based on SSP. We determine each SSP based on multiple factors, including past history of selling such performance obligations as standalone products. We estimate SSP for performance obligations with no observable evidence using adjusted market, cost plus and residual methods to establish the SSPs. In cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, we utilize all observable data points including competitor pricing for a similar or identical product, market and industry data points and our pricing practices to establish the SSP.\nv.Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. We recognize revenue at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied when control of the services or products are transferred to the customers,\nin an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. We record our revenue net of any value added or sales tax.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe use our best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. The uncertainty that exists in the global economic environment has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of bank deposits and money market funds and our short-term investments consist of U.S. government treasury securities. As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of $2.0 billion. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents reasonably approximates fair value, due to the short maturities of these instruments. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the fair market value of our investments as of January 31, 2024 and 2023.\nIn January 2020, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026 in a private placement (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d). The fair value of the 2026 Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the conversion feature. The fair value of the 2026 Notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of the 2026 Notes, but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Additionally, we carry the 2026 Notes at face value less unamortized issuance costs on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds (\u201cGBP\u201d) or Euros (\u201cEUR\u201d). A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the GBP and EUR. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statements of operations. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023. Given the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.\nMarket Risk\nWe could experience additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to observable price changes and impairments to our non-marketable securities. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events,\nparticularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our non-marketable securities. Our non-marketable securities are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital. As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of non-marketable securities included in other assets on our balance sheets were $12.9 million and $9.8 million, respectively.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Allocation of Transaction Price in Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nAs described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, certain of the Company\u2019s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, such as time-based software licenses, post-contract customer support, and services. These arrangements comprise a portion of subscription revenue of $1.6 billion for the year ended January 31, 2024. For these contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, management allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price. Management determines each standalone selling price based on multiple factors, including past history of selling such performance obligations as standalone products. Management estimates standalone selling price for performance obligations with no observable evidence using adjusted market, cost plus and residual methods to establish the standalone selling prices. In cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, management considers observable data points including competitor pricing for a similar or identical product, market and industry data points, and the Company\u2019s pricing practices.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - allocation of transaction price in revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in estimating the standalone selling price for certain of the Company\u2019s performance obligations and allocating the transaction price based on a relative allocation of standalone selling price to those individual performance obligations, which in turn led to (ii) significant auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s estimates of standalone selling price and the allocation of transaction price to the individual performance obligations.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the estimation of the standalone selling price and the allocation of transaction price to the individual performance obligations. These procedures also included testing management\u2019s process for estimating the standalone selling prices, which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodologies used by management in establishing the standalone selling prices; (ii) assessing the reasonableness of the significant assumptions developed by management; and (iii) testing the source data utilized in management\u2019s estimate calculations. These procedures also included testing the relative allocation of transaction price to individual performance obligations based on a sample of contracts.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 15, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2013.\nMONGODB, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nMONGODB, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nMONGODB, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nMONGODB, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nMONGODB, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nMongoDB, Inc. (\u201cMongoDB\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was originally incorporated in the state of Delaware in November 2007 under the name 10Gen, Inc. In August 2013, the Company changed its name to MongoDB, Inc. The Company is headquartered in New York City. MongoDB is the developer data platform company. The foundation of the Company\u2019s offering is the leading, modern general purpose database, which is built on a unique document-based architecture. Organizations can deploy the Company\u2019s database at scale in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment. The Company\u2019s robust platform enables developers to build and modernize applications rapidly and cost-effectively across a broad range of use cases. In addition to selling subscriptions to its software, the Company provides post-contract support, training and consulting services for its offerings. The Company\u2019s fiscal year ends on January 31.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, the period of benefit for deferred contract acquisition costs, the incremental borrowing rate related to the Company\u2019s lease liabilities, stock-based compensation, legal contingencies, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives and carrying values of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, fair value of non-marketable securities and accounting for income taxes. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.\nThe global macroeconomic conditions, including slower economic growth, persistent inflation and high interest rate environment, continue to impact demand and supply for a broad variety of goods and services, including demand from the Company\u2019s customers.\nEstimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to update its estimates, assumptions and judgments or adjust the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company\u2019s international subsidiaries is either the U.S. dollar or the local currency in which the international subsidiary operates. For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Transaction gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement and settlements are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. For foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the local currency, the Company uses the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities and the average exchange rate during the period to translate revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars. Translation gains or losses resulting from translating foreign local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nComprehensive Loss\nThe Company\u2019s comprehensive loss includes net loss, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains such investments primarily in money market funds, which have readily determinable fair values. Money market funds are measured using quoted prices in active markets with changes recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company\u2019s short-term investments consist of U.S. government treasury securities. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its short-term investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its short-term investments as available-for-sale debt securities as the Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes, even prior to maturity. As a result, the Company classifies its short-term investments within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the individual security level and are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, on these short-term investments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until realized.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If either of these criteria are met, the debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the Company evaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. When a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis.\nFor the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record any impairment charges for its marketable debt securities in its consolidated statements of operations.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company pledged $0.7 million of collateral as of January 31, 2024 for its lease related letters of credit, and $0.5 million of collateral as of January 31, 2023 for its available credit on corporate credit cards. Restricted cash balances have been excluded from the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents balance and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nNon-marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities consist of debt and equity investments in privately-held companies, which are classified as other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s non-marketable debt securities are measured at fair value at each reporting period. The Company\u2019s non-marketable equity securities do not have readily determinable fair values. Under the measurement alternative election, the Company accounts for these non-marketable equity securities at cost and adjusts for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer or upon impairment. These securities are not eligible for the net-asset-value practical expedient from fair value measurement. The measurement alternative election is reassessed each reporting period to determine whether the non-marketable securities continue to be eligible for this election.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its non-marketable equity securities for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recovered. Impairment indicators may include,\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nbut are not limited to, a significant deterioration in earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality or business outlook or a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment. If the non-marketable equity securities are considered impaired, the Company will record an impairment charge within other income (expense) on its consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment. For the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record any material impairment charges related to its non-marketable equity securities in its consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company invested $2.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of its cash in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies. The Company evaluated its ownership, contractual and other interests of its investments and determined that as of January 31, 2024, there were no variable interest entities required to be consolidated in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, as the Company was not the primary beneficiary and did not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance. The Company\u2019s maximum loss exposure is limited to the carrying value of these investments.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, non-marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash equivalents are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value. Non-marketable securities consist of debt and equity securities. Non-marketable debt securities are measured at fair value at each reporting period. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs, as described below, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value:\n\u2022Level 1: Observable inputs, such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\n\u2022Level 2: Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\u2022Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The primary focus of the Company\u2019s investment strategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. The Company maintains its cash accounts with financial institutions where, at times, deposits exceed insurance coverage limits. The Company invests its excess cash in highly-rated money market funds and in short-term investments consisting of U.S. government treasury securities.\nThe Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company performs credit analyses and monitors the financial health of its customers to reduce credit risk. The Company does not require collateral from customers to secure accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to certain trade accounts receivable based on various factors, including the review of credit profiles of its customers, contractual terms and conditions, current economic trends and historical customer payment experience.\nAs of January 31, 2024 and 2023, no customer represented 10% or more of net accounts receivable. For the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no customer represented 10% or more of revenue.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until the establishment of technological feasibility, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers and amortized over the estimated life of the product. Technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. To date, costs and time incurred between the establishment of technological feasibility and product release have not been material, resulting in software development costs qualifying for capitalization being immaterial. As a result, the Company has not capitalized any related software development costs in any of the periods presented.\nCosts related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company\u2019s internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development, costs related to the development of web-based product, or implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract, are capitalized during the application development stage. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during post implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. There were no material qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage and the Company did not capitalize any qualifying costs related to computer software developed for internal use, or implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract in the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nDepreciation commences once the asset is ready for its intended use. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation, is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. There was no material gain or loss incurred as a result of retirement or sale in the periods presented. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. An arrangement is or contains a lease if the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nThe Company measures lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. As the Company\u2019s leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the net present value of\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nfuture minimum lease payments is determined using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Options in the lease terms to extend or terminate the lease are not reflected in the lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that any such option will be exercised.\nThe Company measures right-of-use assets at the lease commencement date based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for (i) prepayments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs incurred and (iii) certain tenant incentives under the lease. The Company evaluates the recoverability of the right-of-use assets for possible impairment in accordance with the long-lived assets policy.\nThe Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less, and instead recognize the associated lease payments for these short-term leases in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLease expenses for minimum lease payments for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amortization expense of the right-of-use assets for finance leases is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. Interest expense for finance leases is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate used to determine the finance lease liability. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the lease liability and right-of-use assets calculation.\nOperating leases are reflected in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, other accrued liabilities, and other liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. Within the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company classifies all cash payments associated with operating leases within operating activities and for finance leases, repayments of principal are presented within financing activities and interest payments are presented within operating activities.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. The Company did not record impairment charges related to long-lived assets during the years presented.\nIn addition to the recoverability assessment, the Company periodically reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets. If the estimated useful life assumption for any asset is changed due to new information, the remaining unamortized balance would be depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life, on a prospective basis.\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company\u2019s single operating segment is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of the Company\u2019s single operating segment with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, no further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. No indicators of impairment of goodwill were identified during the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment of goodwill during those periods.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenue from two sources: (1) the sales of subscriptions, which includes the usage-based database-as-a-service offering and the term license and post-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d); and (2) services revenue comprised of consulting and training arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Company performs the following steps:\ni.Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer - The Company contracts with its customers through order forms, which are governed by master sales agreements. The Company determines it has a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party\u2019s rights regarding the products or services to be transferred is identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer\u2019s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer\u2019s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, reputation and financial or other information pertaining to the customer. At contract inception, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Company has concluded that its contracts with customers do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.\nii.Identification of the performance obligations in the contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services or products that will be transferred to the customer that are both (1) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service or product either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company and (2) distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services or products, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised services or products are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised services or products are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation.\niii.Determination of the transaction price - The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring services and products to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company\u2019s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. None of the Company\u2019s contracts contain a significant financing component.\niv.Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) basis. The Company also considers if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract and if so, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to such rights based on SSP. The Company determines each SSP based on multiple factors, including past history of selling such performance obligations as standalone products. The Company estimates SSP for performance obligations with no observable evidence using adjusted market, cost plus and residual methods to establish the SSPs. In cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, the Company considers observable data points including competitor pricing for a similar or identical product, market and industry data points and the Company\u2019s pricing practices to establish the SSP.\nv.Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation - The Company recognizes revenue at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied when control of the services or products are transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. The Company records its revenue net of any value added or sales tax.\nSubscription Revenue\nThe Company sells subscriptions directly through its field and inside sales teams and indirectly through channel partners, as well as through its self-serve channel. The majority of the Company\u2019s subscription contracts are one year in duration and are invoiced upfront or invoiced monthly in arrears. When the Company enters into multi-year subscription\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\ncontracts, the customer is typically invoiced on an annual basis or pays upfront. The Company\u2019s subscription contracts are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable.\nThe Company derives subscription revenue from providing its software to customers with its database-as-a-service offering that include comprehensive infrastructure and management of the Company\u2019s database and can also be purchased with additional enterprise features. Performance obligations related to database-as-a-service solutions are recognized on a usage-basis, as the use of this service represents a direct measurement of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract.\nThe Company\u2019s subscription revenue also includes time-based software licenses sold in conjunction with PCS. These subscription offerings are generally priced on a per server basis, subject to a per server random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d) limit. Performance obligations related to subscription revenue for time-based software licenses include a license portion, which represents functional intellectual property under which a customer has the legal right to the license. The license provides significant standalone functionality and is therefore deemed a distinct performance obligation. License revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon delivery and transfer of control of the underlying license to the customer, which is typically the subscription start date.\nPerformance obligations related to PCS include unspecified updates, as well as support and maintenance. While separate performance obligations are identified within PCS, the underlying performance obligations generally have a consistent continuous pattern of transfer to a customer during the term of a contract. Revenue from PCS is recognized ratably over the contract duration.\nServices Revenue\nThe Company\u2019s services contracts are generally provisioned on a time-and-materials basis. Revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services are delivered to the customers.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nCertain of the Company\u2019s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, including those described above such as time-based software licenses, PCS, database-as-a-service offering and services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to each separate performance obligation based on its relative SSP basis.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Subscription Revenue\nCost of subscription revenue primarily includes third-party cloud infrastructure expenses for the Company\u2019s database- as-a-service offering. Cost of subscription revenue also includes personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees associated with the Company\u2019s subscription arrangements principally related to technical support and allocated shared costs, as well as depreciation and amortization.\nCost of Services Revenue\nCost of services revenue primarily includes personnel costs, including salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation for employees associated with the Company\u2019s professional service contracts, as well as, travel costs, allocated shared costs and depreciation and amortization.\nDeferred Commissions\nThe Company capitalizes its incremental costs of obtaining subscription contracts with customers, which generally consist of sales commissions paid to the Company\u2019s sales force and related payroll taxes, as well as fees paid to marketplace vendors. Incremental costs that are expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve months are recorded on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as deferred commissions with the remaining, non-current, portion recorded under other assets. Deferred commissions are amortized over a period of benefit that the Company has determined to be generally five years. The Company determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of its customer contracts, its technology and other factors. Deferred commissions also include all other sales commissions and related payroll taxes for subscription contracts, which are amortized based on the pattern of the associated revenue recognition over the related contractual subscription period. Sales commissions are generally paid up front and one month in arrears, however, the timing\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nof payment is based on contractual terms of the underlying subscription contract and is subject to an evaluation of customer credit-worthiness. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue under the non-cancelable customer contracts. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company adopted the practical expedient that permits an entity to expense the costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected amortization period is one year or less. Deferred commissions are reviewed periodically for impairment. Refer to Note 9, Revenue for more information.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of customer billings or payments received in advance of the Company satisfying the performance obligations on its subscription and services contracts. The Company generally invoices its customers annually in advance for its subscription services. Typical payment terms provide that customers pay the amount due within 30 days of the invoice date. Deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current. The Company\u2019s contract liabilities are classified as deferred revenue upon the right to invoice or when payments have been received for undelivered products or services. Deferred revenue does not necessarily represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company records a receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, such that only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. If revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings, then the Company records an unbilled receivable for that excess amount, which is included as part of accounts receivable, net in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through the sales of subscriptions and services, which are recorded as accounts receivable, inclusive of unbilled receivables. The Company performs initial and ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial position and generally extends credit without collateral. Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, and do not bear interest.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts represents the best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses against the existing accounts receivable, inclusive of unbilled receivables, based on certain factors including past collection experience, credit quality of the customer, current aging of the receivable balance, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, as well as specific circumstances arising with individual customers. Extensive judgment is required in assessing these factors. Due to the short-term nature of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable, forecasts have limited relevance to the Company\u2019s expected credit loss estimates. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management determines a balance is uncollectible and the Company no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable. The Company\u2019s estimates of the allowance for credit losses may not be indicative of the Company\u2019s actual credit losses requiring additional charges to be incurred to reflect the actual amount collected. See also Note 9, Revenue for more information on allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled receivables.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nThe Company early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06-Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d) as of February 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective transition method.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, in accounting for the issuance of the Company\u2019s convertible senior notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d), the Notes were separated into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the respective Notes. This difference represented the debt discount that was amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity component was recorded in additional paid-in capital and was not remeasured as long as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nIn accounting for the debt issuance costs related to the Notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the Notes based on their relative fair values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the Notes. The issuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted against the equity component representing the conversion option in additional paid-in capital.\nTransactions involving contemporaneous exchanges of cash between the same debtor and creditor in connection with the issuance of a new debt obligation and satisfaction of an existing debt obligation by the debtor are evaluated as a modification or an exchange transaction depending on whether the exchange is determined to have substantially different terms. For exchange transactions that are considered an extinguishment of debt, the total consideration for such an exchange is separated into liability and equity components by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without a conversion option and assigning the residual value to the equity component. The gain or loss on extinguishment of the debt is subsequently determined by comparing repurchase consideration allocated to the liability component to the sum of the carrying value of the liability component, net of the proportionate amounts of unamortized debt discount and remaining unamortized debt issuance costs.\nThe liability component of the Notes was classified as non-current until the reporting period date was within one year of maturity of the Notes or when the Company has received a redemption request, but settlement would occur after the reporting period date. Under these circumstances, the net carrying amount of the Notes was classified as a current liability and a portion of the equity component representing the conversion option was reclassified to temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the equity component classified as temporary equity was measured as the difference between the principal and net carrying amount of the Notes, excluding debt issuance costs.\nUpon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company no longer records the conversion feature of its convertible senior notes in equity. Instead, the Company combined the previously separated equity component with the liability component, which together is now classified as debt, thereby eliminating the subsequent amortization of the debt discount as interest expense. Similarly, the portion of issuance costs previously allocated to equity was reclassified to debt and amortized as interest expense. Accordingly, the Company recorded a decrease to accumulated deficit of $52.6 million, a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $309.4 million, a decrease to temporary equity of $4.7 million and an increase to convertible senior notes, net, of $261.5 million. There was an immaterial benefit from the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the convertible senior notes upon the adoption of ASU 2020-06. Prior period financial statements were not restated.\nAlso upon adoption, the Company is no longer utilizing the treasury stock method for earnings per share purposes. Instead, the Company is applying the if-converted method when reporting the number of potentially dilutive shares of common stock. Although the required use of the if-converted method will not impact the diluted net loss per share as long as the Company is in a net loss position, the Company is required to include disclosures of all the underlying shares regardless of the average stock price for the reporting period.\nThe Company\u2019s convertible senior notes are classified as non-current liabilities until the reporting period date is within one year of maturity of the convertible senior notes or when the Company has received a redemption request, but settlement will occur after the reporting period date. Under such circumstances, the carrying amount of the convertible senior notes, net of the associated unamortized debt issuance costs, is classified as a current liability.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits and stock-based compensation. Research and development costs also include amortization associated with acquired finite-lived intangible assets and allocated overhead.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred, or the first time the advertising takes place, based on the nature of the advertising. Advertising costs were $29.7 million, $18.7 million and $18.0 million for the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Advertising costs are recorded in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense related to stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employees is calculated based on the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant. For restricted stock units, fair value is based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date.\nFor stock options and purchase rights issued to employees under the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201c2017 ESPP\u201d), the Company determines the grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This option-pricing model requires the use of assumptions, which are subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine. The assumptions for the option-pricing model were determined as follows:\ni.Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. For option grants that are considered to be \u201cplain vanilla,\u201d the Company determines the expected term using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For purchase rights granted under the 2017 ESPP, the expected term represents the offering period.\nii.Expected Volatility. Since the Company had limited trading history of its common stock, the expected volatility for its stock option grants was derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the Company\u2019s industry that the Company considered to be comparable to its own business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. For purchase rights granted under the 2017 ESPP, the volatility is derived from the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock.\niii.Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the option\u2019s expected term and 2017 ESPP offering period.\niv.Dividend Rate. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to do so.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price volatility and expected option life involve management's best estimates, both of which impact the fair value estimated under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized.\nThe Company recognizes the related stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units and stock options on a straight-line basis over the employee\u2019s requisite service period, which is generally four years. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. The Company recognizes the stock-based compensation expense related to the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nNet Loss Per Share\nThe Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period, including stock options, restricted stock units and convertible senior notes. Refer to Note 11. Net Loss Per Share for more information.\nSegment Information\nThe Company has one operating and reportable segment as the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), reviews financial information on an aggregate and consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, all required segment information can be found in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties on amounts due to taxing authorities as a component of other income (expense), net.\nRelated Party Transactions\nAll contracts with related parties are executed in the ordinary course of business. There were no material related party transactions in the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts payable to or amounts receivable from related parties.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires companies to provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items. The guidance requires companies to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment\u2019s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The guidance is applied retrospectively and is effective for the Company for fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, and for interim periods beginning February 1, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires companies to disclose additional information about income taxes, primarily their rate reconciliation information and income taxes paid. The new guidance requires companies to disclose in their rate reconciliation table additional categories of information about federal, state and foreign income taxes and to provide more details about the reconciling items in some categories if the items meet a quantitative threshold. Additionally companies will be required to disclose annually income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign taxes and to disaggregate the information by jurisdiction based on a quantitative threshold. The guidance is effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2026, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables present information about the Company\u2019s financial assets that have been measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2024 and 2023 and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands):\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe Company utilized the market approach and Level 1 valuation inputs to value its money market mutual funds and U.S. government treasury securities because published net asset values were readily available.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of the Company\u2019s short-term investments by remaining contractual maturity as of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nAs of January 31, 2024, unrealized gain on the Company\u2019s U.S. government treasury securities were approximately $2.2 million. As of January 31, 2023, unrealized losses on the Company\u2019s U.S. government treasury securities were approximately $2.4 million. These unrealized gains and losses were caused by fluctuations in interest rates, which results in changes to the market value of these securities. Because the decline in fair value is due to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity, the Company concluded that an allowance for credit losses was unnecessary for short-term investments as of January 31, 2024 and 2023. Gross realized gains and losses were not material for each of the for each of the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023. There were no short-term investments in a continuous loss position for greater than twelve months.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nThe Company measures the fair value of its outstanding convertible senior notes on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes. The Company considers the fair value of its convertible senior notes at January 31, 2024 to be a Level 2 measurement due to limited trading activity of the convertible senior notes. Refer to Note 6, Convertible Senior Notes, to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nNon-marketable Securities\nAs of January 31, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of non-marketable equity and debt securities included in other assets on the Company\u2019s balance sheets were $12.9 million and $9.8 million, respectively. During the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company invested an additional $2.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of its cash in non-marketable equity securities. The Company recognized net unrealized gains on certain of these non-marketable securities of $1.0 million and $1.9 million during the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details. The Company considers these assets as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy when an impairment or observable price changes in orderly transactions are recognized on these non-marketable securities during the period. The estimation of fair value for these investments is inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and inherent lack of liquidity and requires the Company\u2019s judgment and the use of significant unobservable inputs in an inactive market. In addition, the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for the identical or a similar investment requires significant management judgment, including understanding the differences in the rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of those investments and the stage of operational development of the entities.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n4. Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net consists of the following (in thousands):\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was $8.0 million, $6.9 million and $4.5 million for the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense excludes amortization with respect to the finance lease right-of-use asset, which is described further in Note 7, Leases.\n5. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, Net\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the periods presented (in thousands):\nOn September 27, 2023, the Company acquired the assets of Grainite, Inc. (\u201cGrainite\u201d), for total cash consideration of $15.0 million. Grainite is a stream processing application company and the transaction is intended to accelerate the development of the Company\u2019s stream processing offering. The Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination, after determining that the acquired set of assets, the fair value of which was not concentrated in a single asset, or group of similar assets, and included (a) an assembled workforce and (b) intangible asset, met the definition of a business. As a result, the Company allocated the estimated fair value of $3.1 million of the identifiable asset acquired to the developed technology intangible asset. The fair value assigned to the intangible asset was determined through the use of a third-party valuation firm using replacement cost approach methodology, and includes the expected profit margin of a hypothetical third-party developer and a market participant\u2019s opportunity cost. Judgment was applied for a number of assumptions used in the valuation of the identified intangible asset. The excess of the cash consideration over the identifiable intangible assets in the amount of $11.9 million was allocated to goodwill. This transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition for tax purposes, and therefore both the goodwill and acquired intangible asset are deductible for tax purposes. Tax impacts were not material. Acquisition-related transaction costs were not material and have been expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The business combination did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2024.\nIn April 2021, the Company made an acquisition for total cash consideration of $9.0 million, of which $4.5 million was the purchase price to be allocated and $4.5 million will be recognized as post-combination compensation expense. For accounting purposes, this business combination was deemed immaterial. The Company allocated $3.4 million to the acquired developed technology intangible asset based on fair value to be amortized over its economic useful life of five years. The Company also recorded $1.9 million of goodwill, which included a tax benefit associated with the acquisition due to the release of the valuation allowance of $0.8 million.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of the Company\u2019s intangible assets are as follows (in thousands):\nAcquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. Amortization expense of intangible assets was $10.6 million, $9.2 million and $9.1 million for the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amortization expense for developed technology was included as research and development expense in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense for customer relationships was included as sales and marketing expense in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of January 31, 2024, future amortization expense related to the intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):\n6. Convertible Senior Notes\nThe net carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s 2026 Notes (as defined herein) were as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nAs of January 31, 2024, the total estimated fair value (Level 2) of the outstanding 2026 Notes, which is utilized solely for disclosure purposes, was approximately $2.2 billion. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 2026 Notes as of the last day of trading for the period. The fair value of the 2026 Notes is primarily affected by the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock and market interest rates.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe following table sets forth the interest expense related to the 2024 Notes (as defined herein) and 2026 Notes for the periods presented (in thousands):\n(1) The aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2024 Notes was redeemed by the Company in December 2021.\nIn June 2018, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2024 in a private placement and, in July 2018, the Company issued an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the initial purchasers\u2019 option to purchase additional convertible senior notes (collectively, the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d). The 2024 Notes were senior unsecured obligations of the Company with interest payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2018, at a rate of 0.75% per year. The 2024 Notes had a maturity date of June 15, 2024, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchase discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $291.1 million.\nIn January 2020, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026 in a private placement and, also in January 2020, the Company issued an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the initial purchasers\u2019 option to purchase additional convertible senior notes (collectively, the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d). The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on July 15 and January 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2020, at a rate of 0.25% per year. The 2026 Notes will mature on January 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchase discounts and estimated debt issuance costs, were approximately $1.13 billion.\nOn January 14, 2020, in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repurchase $210.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes (the \u201c2024 Notes Partial Repurchase\u201d) leaving $90.0 million aggregate principal outstanding on the 2024 Notes immediately after the exchange. The 2024 Notes Partial Repurchase were individually privately negotiated transactions conducted not pursuant to a redemption notice. The 2024 Notes Partial Repurchase and issuance of the 2026 Notes were deemed to have substantially different terms due to the significant difference between the value of the conversion option immediately prior to and after the exchange, and accordingly, the 2024 Notes Partial Repurchase was accounted for as a debt extinguishment.\nOn October 1, 2021, the Company issued a notice of redemption (the \u201cRedemption Notice\u201d) for the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 2024 Notes. Pursuant to the Redemption Notice, the Company redeemed the outstanding principal of the 2024 Notes that were not converted prior to such date at a redemption price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The extinguishment of the 2024 Notes on December 3, 2021 was immaterial to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nTerms of the 2026 Notes\nFor the 2026 Notes, the initial conversion rate is 4.7349 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $211.20 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.\nThe 2026 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances:\n(1)during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on April 30, 2020 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2026 Notes on each applicable trading day;\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(2)during the five-business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the conversion rate of the 2026 Notes on each such trading day;\n(3)if the Company calls any or all of the 2026 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or\n(4)upon the occurrence of specified corporate events (as set forth in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes).\nOn or after October 15, 2025, until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. If a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2026 Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, or if the Company elects to redeem the 2026 Notes, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such a corporate event or redemption in certain circumstances. It is the Company\u2019s current intent to settle the principal amount of the 2026 Notes in cash.\nDuring the three months ended January 31, 2024, the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes was triggered as the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock was more than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on January 31, 2024 (the last trading day of the fiscal quarter) and therefore the 2026 Notes are currently convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holders from February 1, 2024, through April 30, 2024. Whether the 2026 Notes will be convertible following such period will depend on the continued satisfaction of this condition or another conversion condition in the future. Since the Company has the election of repaying the 2026 Notes in cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, or a combination of both, the Company continued to classify the 2026 Notes as long-term debt on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2024.\nBeginning on January 20, 2023, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2026 Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of its common stock was at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nCapped Calls\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the \u201cCapped Calls\u201d). The Capped Calls associated with the 2024 Notes each had an initial strike price of approximately $68.15 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponded to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Notes. These Capped Calls had initial cap prices of $106.90 per share, subject to certain adjustments.\nThe Capped Calls associated with the 2026 Notes each have an initial strike price of approximately $211.20 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2026 Notes. These Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $296.42 per share, subject to certain adjustments.\nThe Capped Calls are expected to partially offset the potential dilution to the Company\u2019s common stock upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes or 2026 Notes, with such offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The Capped Calls associated with the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 4.4 million shares and 5.4 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, respectively. The Capped Calls are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including merger events, tender offers and the announcement of such events. In addition, the Capped Calls are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Calls, including nationalization, insolvency or delisting, changes in law, failures to deliver, insolvency filings and hedging disruptions. For accounting purposes, the Capped Calls are separate transactions\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nand not part of the terms of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders' equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of $37.1 million and $93.8 million incurred to purchase the Capped Calls associated with the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes, respectively, was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and will not be remeasured. The Company did not unwind any of its Capped Calls through January 31, 2024.\n7. Leases\nThe Company has entered into non-cancelable operating and finance lease agreements, principally real estate for office space globally. The Company may receive renewal or expansion options, leasehold improvement allowances or other incentives on certain lease agreements. Lease terms range from one to 12 years and may include renewal options, which the company deems reasonably certain to be renewed. The exercise of the lease renewal option is at the Company's discretion.\nLease Costs\nThe components of the Company\u2019s lease costs included in its consolidated statements of operations were as follows (in thousands):\nBalance Sheet Components\nThe balances of the Company\u2019s finance and operating leases were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands):\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nSupplemental Information\nThe following table presents supplemental information related to the Company\u2019s finance and operating leases (in thousands, except weighted-average information):\nMaturities of Lease Liabilities\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancelable finance and operating leases on an annual undiscounted cash flow basis as of January 31, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following table includes certain non-cancelable agreements primarily for subscription, marketing services and cloud infrastructure capacity commitments entered into by the Company (in thousands):\nRefer to Note 7, Leases, for further details on obligations under non-cancelable finance and operating leases, including future minimum lease payments.\nNon-cancelable Material Commitments\nOther than certain non-cancelable operating leases described in Note 7, Leases, during the year ended January 31, 2024, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the Company\u2019s contractual obligations and commitments.\nOther Commitments\nThe Company has entered into irrevocable, standby letters of credit, which serve as security deposits for certain of the Company\u2019s leases and expire through June 2026. The maximum amount that can be drawn under these letters of credit is $1.3 million. As of January 31, 2024, no amounts have been drawn under the letters of credit.\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company has become involved in claims, litigation and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property, labor and employment and breach of contract claims. For example, on March 12, 2019, Realtime Data LLC (\u201cRealtime\u201d) filed a lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company is infringing three U.S. patents that it holds. On May 4, 2021, the District Court granted certain defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice. Realtime filed an amended complaint on May 18, 2021, which the District Court dismissed on August 23, 2021. On August 25, 2021, Realtime filed a notice of appeal of the Delaware District Court\u2019s order. The oral argument took place before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on February 10, 2023. On August 2, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued an opinion affirming the District Court's order in favor of the Company. On October 31, 2023, Realtime filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to review the lower court's decision. On January 8, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Realtime\u2019s Writ of Certiorari, leaving the decision by the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, invalidating the at-issue patents, intact. We consider this matter closed.\nThe Company investigates all claims, litigation and other legal matters as they arise. Although claims and litigation are inherently unpredictable, as of January 31, 2024, the Company is currently not aware of any matters that, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company accrues estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and estimable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, including business partners, landlords, contractors and parties performing its research and development. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for certain losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company\u2019s activities. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nbe required to make under these agreements is not determinable. To date, the Company has not incurred material costs as a result of such commitments. The Company maintains commercial general liability insurance and product liability insurance to offset certain of the Company\u2019s potential liabilities under these indemnification provisions.\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers. These agreements require the Company to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of their affiliation with the Company.\n9. Revenue\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nBased on the information provided to and reviewed by the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Company believes that the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors is most appropriately depicted through the Company\u2019s primary geographical markets and subscription product categories. The Company\u2019s primary geographical markets are North and South America (\u201cAmericas\u201d); Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d); and Asia Pacific. The Company also disaggregates its subscription products between its MongoDB Atlas-related offerings and other subscription products, which include MongoDB Enterprise Advanced.\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s revenues disaggregated by primary geographical markets, subscription product categories and services (in thousands):\nCustomers located in the United States accounted for 54%, 55% and 54% of total revenue for the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No other country accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the periods presented.\nAs of January 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of the Company\u2019s long-lived assets were located in the United States and Ireland.\nContract Liabilities\nThe Company\u2019s contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets and consist of customer invoices issued or payments received in advance of revenues being recognized from the Company\u2019s subscription and services contracts. Deferred revenue, including current and non-current balances as of January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $377.4 million, $460.3 million and $375.2 million, respectively. Approximately 25% and 27% of the total revenue recognized in the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 was from deferred revenue at the beginning of each respective period.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price in contracts allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue, multi-year contracts with future installment payments and certain unfulfilled orders against accepted customer contracts at the end of any given period. As of January 31, 2024, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $591.4 million. Approximately 53% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. The Company applies the practical expedient to omit disclosure with respect to the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the related contract has a total duration of 12 months or less.\nUnbilled Receivables\nRevenue recognized in excess of invoiced amounts creates an unbilled receivable, which represents the Company\u2019s unconditional right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to the customer. Unbilled receivables are recorded as part of accounts receivable, net in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. As of January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, unbilled receivables were $22.7 million, $9.7 million and $6.1 million, respectively.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company considers expectations of forward-looking losses, in addition to historical loss rates, to estimate its allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable. The following is a summary of the changes in the Company\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):\nThe increase in allowance for doubtful accounts at January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the increase in sales of our products and services.\nCosts Capitalized to Obtain Contracts with Customers\nDeferred commissions were $294.2 million and $252.4 million as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which $201.7 million and $168.9 million comprised the non-current portion and was included in other assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization expense with respect to deferred commissions, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations, was $99.5 million, $79.6 million and $49.1 million for years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There was no impairment loss in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.\n10. Equity Incentive Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n2008 Stock Incentive Plan and 2016 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe Company adopted the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended, the \u201c2008 Plan\u201d) and the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d), primarily for the purpose of granting stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants, including stock options, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and other stock-based awards. With the establishment of the 2016 Plan in December 2016, all shares available for grant under the 2008 Plan were transferred to the 2016 Plan. The Company no longer grants any stock-based awards under the 2008 Plan and any shares underlying stock options canceled under the 2008 Plan will be automatically transferred to the 2016 Plan. Stock options granted under the stock option plans may be either incentive stock options (\u201cISOs\u201d) or nonstatutory stock options (\u201cNSOs\u201d). ISOs may be granted to employees and NSOs may be granted to employees, directors, or consultants. All outstanding stock options as of January 31, 2024 were\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\ngranted as NSOs with the exception of one ISO award. The exercise prices of the stock option grants must be no less than 100% of the fair value of the common stock on the grant date as determined by the Board of Directors. If, at the date of grant, the optionee owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of outstanding stock (a \u201c10% stockholder\u201d), the exercise price must be at least 110% of the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted are exercisable over a maximum term of 10 years from the date of grant or five years from the date of grant for ISOs granted to any 10% stockholder. The Board of Directors or a committee thereof determines the vesting schedule for all equity awards. Stock option awards generally vest over a period of four years with 25% vesting on the one year anniversary of the award and the remainder vesting monthly over the next 36 months of the grantee\u2019s service to the Company. RSU awards granted to new employees generally vest over a period of four years with 25% vesting on the one year anniversary of the award and the remainder vesting quarterly over the next 12 quarters, subject to the grantee\u2019s continued service to the Company. RSUs granted to existing employees generally vest quarterly over a period of four years, subject to the grantee\u2019s continued service to the Company.\nPursuant to the terms of the 2016 Plan, the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock reserved for issuance was increased by 3.5 million shares in February 2023. As of January 31, 2024, the Company has approximately 13.7 million shares of common stock available for future grants.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the periods presented (in thousands, except share and per share data and years):\nThere were no options granted during the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023. The intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was determined to be $308.0 million, $211.1 million and $469.1 million, respectively.\nThere were no options vested during the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023. The aggregate grant date fair value of stock options vested during the year ended January 31, 2022, was $1.3 million. As of January 31, 2024, there was no unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding stock options.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023:\nAs of January 31, 2024, there was $967.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.73 years.\nExecutive Performance Share Awards\nDuring three months ended April 30, 2022, the Company created a long-term performance-based equity award program and granted performance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) to the Company\u2019s CEO and certain other executives. The vesting of PSUs is conditioned upon the achievement of certain targets.The PSUs vest annually over a period of three years from the date of grant, subject to the executive\u2019s continued employment with the Company. Each vested PSU entitles the executive to one share of common stock. A PSU performance factor of 100 will result in the targeted number of PSUs being vested. The minimum percentage of PSUs that can vest is zero, with a maximum percentage of 200. On each date of grant, the Company assumes a performance factor of 100.\nThe following table summarizes PSU activity for the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023:\nThe grant date fair value of PSUs was determined by using the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of the grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period based on the probability of the performance conditions being satisfied using the accelerated attribution method. Following the completion of the performance year, the achieved PSU performance factor was 151.0 and 98.5 for the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized $24.1 million and $11.5 million of compensation expense related to these PSUs for the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of January 31, 2024, the Company had $21.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to these PSUs, which it expects to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.03 years.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n2016 China Stock Appreciation Rights Plan\nIn April 2016, the Company adopted the 2016 China Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (as amended, the \u201cChina SAR Plan\u201d) for its employees in China. These awards, which are granted to new employees, generally vest over four years with 25% vesting on the one year anniversary of the award and the remainder vesting monthly over the next 36 months of the grantee\u2019s service to the Company. Awards granted to existing employees generally vest quarterly over a period of four years, subject to the grantee\u2019s continued service to the Company. The China SAR Plan units are cash settled upon exercise and will be paid as a cash bonus equal to the difference between the strike price of the vested plan units and the fair market value of common stock at the end of each reporting period.\nAs of November 1, 2021, the Company does not expect to grant stock appreciation rights in the future and will instead grant RSUs to its employees in China. Therefore, no China SAR Plan units were granted for the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2022 the Company granted 5,532 units of the China SAR Plan at a weighted average strike price of $386.23 per share.\nDuring the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, upon the vesting of 619, 1,141 and 1,296 units, respectively, the total expense recognized related to China SAR was $3.3 million, $2.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company\u2019s liability balance related to the China SAR Plan was $5.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded as part of the accrued compensation and benefits on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets and recognized as bonus expense in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended January 31, 2024, the Company paid $0.6 million in cash upon the exercise of 1,890 units. As of January 31, 2024, there were 15,098 China SAR Plan units outstanding of which 60 units remained unvested.\n2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn October 2017, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors adopted and stockholders approved, the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201c2017 ESPP\u201d). Subject to any plan limitations, the 2017 ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute, normally through payroll deductions, up to 15% of their earnings for the purchase of the Company\u2019s common stock at a discounted price per share. Except for the initial offering period, the ESPP provides for separate six-month offering periods.\nUnless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the Company\u2019s common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the ESPP at a price per share that is the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the first trading day of the offering period, or (2) 85% of the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the last trading day of the offering period.\nPursuant to the terms of the 2017 ESPP, the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock reserved for issuance was increased by 699,066 shares in February 2023. As of January 31, 2024, there were 3,533,472 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock available for future issuance under the 2017 ESPP.\nDuring the years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 there were 167,574, 149,352 and 85,401 shares, respectively, of common stock purchased under the ESPP. The total expense related to the ESPP for years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.4 million, $13.7 million and $9.4 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2024, there was $5.9 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP offering period expected to end in June 2024.\nThe fair value of the purchase rights granted under the 2017 ESPP was estimated on the first day of the offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nTotal stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations is as follows (in thousands):\n11. Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year, less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the period, including stock options and restricted stock units. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details on the Company\u2019s methodology for calculating net loss per share.\nBasic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each year presented, as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss reported for each year presented.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company calculated the potential dilutive effect of its 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes under the treasury stock method. As a result, only the amount by which the conversion value exceeded the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes (the \u201cconversion spread\u201d) was considered in the diluted earnings per share computation. The conversion spread only had a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share when the average market price of the Company\u2019s common stock for a given period exceeded the initial conversion price of $68.15 per share for the 2024 Notes and $211.20 per share for the 2026 Notes.\nUpon the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on February 1, 2021, the Company calculates the potential dilutive effect of its 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes under the if-converted method. Under this method, diluted earnings per share is determined by assuming that all of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes were converted into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at the beginning of the reporting period.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes, the Company entered into Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Capped Calls are expected to partially offset the potential dilution to the Company\u2019s common stock upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe following weighted-average outstanding potentially dilutive shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because the impact of including them would have been anti-dilutive:\n12. Income Taxes\nThe components of loss before provision for income taxes were as follows (in thousands):\nThe components of the provision for income taxes were as follows (in thousands):\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory income tax rate and the provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in thousands):\nThe increase in the provision for income taxes during the years ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in foreign taxes as the Company continued its global expansion. In addition, the overall provision for income taxes for the year ended January 31, 2022 was lower due to a reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of goodwill from an immaterial business combination and the impact from the adoption of ASU 2020-06.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes, as well as operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nSignificant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets are shown in the following table as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively (in thousands):\nDeferred tax assets are recognized when management believes it more likely than not that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $903.7 million, $809.0 million and $677.3 million, respectively. The valuation allowance increased by $94.7 million and $131.7 million during the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nAs of January 31, 2024 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal, state, Irish and U.K. income tax purposes of $2.1 billion, $2.0 billion, $781.5 million and $64.6 million, respectively, which begin to expire in the year ending January 31, 2028 for U.S. federal purposes and January 31, 2025 for state purposes. Ireland, U.K. and the U.S. federal losses for years after January 31, 2019 allows for operating losses to be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also has U.S. federal and state research credit carryforwards of $133.4 million and $11.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in the year ending January 31, 2029 for federal purposes and January 31, 2025 for state purposes. Furthermore, the Company has U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $9.9 million and U.S. charitable contribution carryforwards of $0.6 million, which will begin to expire in the year ending January 31, 2030 and January 31, 2025, respectively. Utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and similar state provisions. The annual limitation, should the Company undergo an ownership change, may result in the expiration of federal or state net operating losses and credits before utilization, however the Company does not expect any such limitation to be material.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe calculation of the Company\u2019s tax obligations involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. The Company has assessed its income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination, based upon the Company\u2019s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at each period end. For those tax positions where the Company has determined there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be\nMONGODB, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nsustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is determined there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized.\nAlthough the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, the Company can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. As the Company expands internationally, it will face increased complexity and the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits may increase in the future. The Company makes adjustments to its reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the Company\u2019s unrecognized gross tax benefits during the periods presented (in thousands):\nIn FY24, the Company recorded an addition in reserves for tax positions in prior years related to U.S. research and development tax credits. Additionally, the Company recorded additional intangible development costs for the current and historical years. As of January 31, 2024, $0.7 million of these total unrecognized tax benefits would have an impact on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate if recognized.\nWe intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\nThe Company is not currently under Internal Revenue Service, state, or foreign income tax examination with the exception of an audit in France for which the Company does not expect a material outcome. The Company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in its uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months. The Company files tax returns in the United States for federal and certain states. All tax years remain open to examination for both federal and state purposes as a result of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards. The Company files foreign tax returns in various locations. These foreign returns are open to examination for the fiscal years ending January 31, 2015 through January 31, 2023.",

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\u201d as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate \u201cinternal control over financial reporting,\u201d as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on the results of its evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and Rule 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
