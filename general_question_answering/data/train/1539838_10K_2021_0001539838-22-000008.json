    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities. Other risks are described in Item 1. \u201cBusiness and Properties,\u201d Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d These risks are not the only risks we face. We could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nOur business and operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and volatility in the oil and natural gas markets. In addition, if commodity prices decrease, our production, estimates of proved reserves and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nAfter turning negative in April 2020, NYMEX WTI prices have recovered, closing at $85.43 per Bbl as of January 18, 2022, as demand for oil and natural gas increased and many restrictions on conducting business implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were lifted due to improved treatments and availability of vaccinations in the U.S. and globally. The emergence of the Delta COVID-19 variant in the latter part of 2021 and the subsequent surge of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, however, contributed to economic and pricing volatility as industry and market participants evaluated industry conditions and production outlook. Despite the recent recovery in demand for oil and natural gas and commodity prices, we have kept production on our acreage relatively flat during 2021, using excess cash flow for debt repayment and/or return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program. We intend to continue exercising capital discipline by maintaining our oil production flat in 2022 at the fourth quarter 2021 level. We cannot reasonably predict whether production levels will remain at current levels or the full extent of the events above and any subsequent recovery may have on our industry and our business.\nDue to the improvement in commodity pricing environment and industry conditions, we did not record any impairments in 2021. However, if commodity prices fall below current levels, we may be required to record impairments in future periods and such impairments could be material. Further, if commodity prices decrease, our production, proved reserves and cash flows will be adversely impacted. Reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which could limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to present operational, health, labor, logistics and other challenges, and it is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and cash flows.\nThere are many variables and uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence, contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus and their severity; the effectiveness of treatments or vaccines against the virus or its new strains; the extent of travel restrictions, business closures and other measures that are or may be imposed in affected areas or countries by governmental authorities; disruptions in the supply chain; an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; increased logistics costs; additional costs due to remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines and other COVID-19-related challenges. Further, there remain increased risks of cyberattacks on information technology systems used in a remote working environment; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; absence of workforce due to illness; the impact of the pandemic on any of our contractual counterparties; and other factors that are currently unknown or considered immaterial. It is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and cash flows.\nMarket conditions for oil and natural gas, and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth, production and the present value of our estimated reserves.\nOur revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; the level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of foreign imports; political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South\nAmerica and Russia; the potential impact of any Russian-Ukrainian conflict on the global energy markets; the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East; the ability of members of the OPEC+ to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts; the level of consumer product demand; extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters; risks associated with operating drilling rigs; technological advances affecting energy consumption; the price and availability of alternative fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including the Biden Administration\u2019s energy and environmental policies; global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as COVID-19 and its variants; the proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and overall domestic and global economic conditions. Our results of operations may also be adversely impacted by any future government rule, regulation or order that may impose production limits, as well as pipeline capacity and storage constraints, in the Permian Basin where we operate.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. During 2021, NYMEX WTI prices ranged from $47.62 to $84.65 per Bbl and the NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas ranged from $2.45 to $6.31 per MMBtu. If the prices of oil and natural gas decline, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income.\nA significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. In addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and to maintain the production in paying quantities, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells and maintaining such production, we could lose our rights under such leases. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage.\nOur development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. In 2021, our total capital expenditures, including expenditures for drilling, completion, infrastructure and additions to midstream assets, were approximately $1.5 billion. Our 2022 capital budget for drilling, completion and infrastructure, including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects, is currently estimated to be approximately $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion, representing an increase of 23% from our 2021 capital expenditures. Since completing our initial public offering in October 2012, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes.\nWe intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, while future acquisitions may also be funded from operations as well as proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including our proved reserves; the volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells; the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold; our ability to acquire, locate and produce economically new reserves; and our ability to borrow under our credit facility.\nWe cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, our actual capital expenditures in 2022 could exceed our capital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include traditional reserve base borrowings, debt financing, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nIf we are unable to fund our capital requirements or our costs of capital increase, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan, complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. In addition, a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings.\nOur success depends on finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. To increase reserves and production, we undertake development, exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities. If we are unable to replace our current production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Furthermore, although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly, our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase.\nOur failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth.\nThere is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves, future oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials, operating costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain, and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nCompetition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. If these acquisitions include geographic regions in which we do not currently operate, we could be subject to unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities. In addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. Further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our financial position and results of operations may also fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nIt is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nPrior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest, which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.\nOur identified potential drilling locations, which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans, are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have approximately 9,314 gross (6,311 net) identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately $50.00 per Bbl WTI. As of December 31, 2021, only 602 of our gross identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves. These drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, construction of infrastructure, unusual or unexpected geological formations, title problems, facility or equipment malfunctions, unexpected operational events, inclement weather, environmental and other regulatory requirements and approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs, drilling results and the availability of water. Further, our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we have identified approximately 2,531 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells, which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours. We cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. Through December 31, 2021, we are the operator of, have participated in, or have acquired working interest in a total of 2,842 horizontal producing wells completed on our acreage. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the Permian Basin may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. In a highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any reduction in our current drilling program, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations. In order to hold our current leases expiring in 2022, we will need to operate at least a one-rig program. Any non-renewal or other loss of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe have entered into commodity price derivatives for a portion of our production. Although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2022 and 2023 production, we may still be adversely affected by declines in the price of oil and may be exposed to other risks, including counterparty credit risk.\nWe use commodity price derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales. To the extent that the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further, we may not be able to economically hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges, and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nAt settlement, market prices for commodities may exceed the contract prices in our commodity price derivatives agreements, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties. Further, by using commodity derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to credit risk if we are in a positive position at contract settlement and the counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We do not require collateral from our counterparties.\nFor additional information regarding our outstanding derivative contracts as of December 31, 2021, see Note 15-Derivatives to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIf production from our Permian Basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contracts, which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are a party to long-term crude oil agreements under which, subject to certain terms and conditions, we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to our counterparties. Our maximum delivery obligation under these agreements varies for different periods and depends in some cases upon certain conditions beyond our control. If production from our Permian Basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities, as a result of the low commodity price environment, production related difficulties or otherwise, we may be unable to meet our obligations under our oil purchase agreements, which may result in deficiency payments to certain counterparties or a default under such agreements and may have an adverse effect on our company.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate (approximately $72 million at December 31, 2021) and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $598 million at December 31, 2021). Joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill. We are generally unable to control which co-owners participate in our wells.\nWe are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. See \u201cBusiness and Properties-Oil and Natural Gas Production Prices and Production Costs-Marketing and Customers\u201d for additional information regarding these customers. This concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by any adverse changes in economic and other conditions. We do not require our customers to post collateral. Under certain circumstances, the revenue due to them can be offset by any unpaid receivables. The inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results.\nOur method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value.\nWe account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. We also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment.\nThe net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. We use the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12-month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues.\nNo impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. Impairments of proved oil and natural gas properties of $6.0 billion and $0.8 billion were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOur estimated reserves and EURs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nOil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves, projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. The EURs for our horizontal wells are based on management\u2019s internal estimates. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. Also, certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices, production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows. A substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves.\nThe standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our PV-10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves.\nThe present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves, or standardized measure, and our related PV-10 calculation, may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12-month average oil index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties.\nActual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board Codification 932, \u201cExtractive Activities-Oil and Gas,\u201d may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate.\nApproximately 33% of our total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2021, were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling and completion operations. The reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\nOur producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area.\nOur producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids and extreme weather conditions, such as the severe winter storms in the Permian Basin in February 2021, and their adverse impact on production volumes, availability of electrical power, road accessibility and transportation facilities. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the Permian Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, as of December 31, 2021, most of our proved reserves are concentrated in the Wolfberry play in the Midland Basin. This concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.\nWe depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. The loss of one or more of these purchasers could, among other factors, limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nThe availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce. We cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production. In addition, we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. See \u201cBusiness and Properties-Oil and Natural Gas Production Prices and Production Costs-Marketing and Customers\u201d for additional information regarding these customers. The loss of one or more of these customers, and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies, oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. When shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. In accordance with customary industry practice, we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells. If we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire. In addition, we do not have long-term contracts securing the use of our existing rigs, and the operators of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. Over the past several years, Texas has experienced extreme drought conditions. As a result of this severe drought, some local water\ndistricts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water, we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecent regulatory restrictions on use of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells in the Permian Basin to stem rising seismic activity and earthquakes could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn September 2021, the Texas Railroad Commission curtailed the amount of produced water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near Midland and Odessa in the Permian Basin, and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas. These actions were taken in an effort to control induced seismic activity and recent increases in earthquakes in the Permian Basin, which have been linked by the U.S. and local seismologists to wastewater disposal in oil fields. These restrictions on the disposal of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells could result in increased operating costs, requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or dispose of it by other means, all of which could be costly. We or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, or require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells. These factors may make drilling activity in the affected parts of the Permian Basin less economical and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future.\nOur development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques; therefore, the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.\nOur operations involve developing and utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022spacing of wells to maximize economic return;\n\u2022landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022running our casing the entire length of the well bore; and\n\u2022being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to:\n\u2022fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u2022run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations;\n\u2022successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; and\n\u2022prevent unintentional communication with other wells.\nFurthermore, certain of the new techniques we are adopting, such as infill drilling and multi-well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to, in the case of infill drilling, offset wells being shut in and, in the case of multi-well pad drilling, the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. The results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, and/or declines in natural gas and oil prices, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we\nanticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. If these facilities are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties. Our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering line, which interconnects with third party pipelines. Our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with a purchaser or into a third-party gathering system. We do not control third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied. Insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. For example, on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the Permian Basin. If, in the future, we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, we may be required to shut in or curtail production. In addition, the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control, such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance, excessive pressure, ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we are provided with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any such shut in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. In addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation, remediation, emission and disposal of oil and natural gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. Further, these laws and regulations imposed strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us. In addition, federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. Even if federal regulatory burdens temporarily ease, the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations may continue in the long-term, and at the state and local levels. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Regulation\u201d for a detailed description of certain laws and regulations that affect us.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may\nlead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nDerivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe July 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which we refer to as Dodd-Frank Act, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which we refer to as the CFTC, the SEC, and federal regulators of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Prudential Regulators, adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.\nAlthough some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued many rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including a rule, which we refer to as the Mandatory Clearing Rule, requiring clearing of hedges, or swaps, that are subject to it (currently, only certain interest rate and credit default swaps), a rule, which we refer to as the End User Exception, establishing an \u201cend user\u201d exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, a rule, which we refer to as the Margin Rule, setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared and also an exception to the Margin Rule for end users that are not financial end users, which exception we refer to as the Non-Financial End User Exception, and a rule imposing position limits, which we refer to as the Position Limit Rule, and also an exception to the Position Limit Rule for swaps that constitute a \u201cbona fide hedging transaction or position\u201d within the definition of such term under the Position Limit Rule, subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Position Limit Rule, which we refer to as the Bona Fide Hedging Exception.\nWe qualify for the End User Exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, we qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception and will not be required to post margin in connection with uncleared swaps under the Margin Rule, and each of our existing and anticipated hedging positions constitutes a \u201cbona fide hedging transaction or position\u201d under the Position Limit Rule and we intend to undertake the filing, recordkeeping and reporting necessary to utilize the Bona Fide Hedging Exception under the Position Limit Rule, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules. However, most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the End User Exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers, major swap participants, financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations (including laws and regulations giving the European Union financial authorities the power to write-down amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations and/or require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts), which we refer to collectively as Foreign Regulations, which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations, which we refer to as Foreign Counterparties, and the U.S. adopted law and rules, which we call the U.S. Resolution Stay Rules, clarifying similar rights of U.S. banking authorities with respect to banking institutions subject to their regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated, the Limit Rule and the U.S. Resolution Stay Rules could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. The Foreign Regulations could have similar effects. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulation, the U.S. Resolution Stay Rules and Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nFuture U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nFrom time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and natural gas industry, including (i) eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. These proposed changes in the U.S. tax law, if adopted, or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration, development or similar activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe operate in areas of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets.\nOur operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the Permian Basin in West Texas, an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly. As a result, demand for qualified personnel in this area, and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. Moreover, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer.\nAny delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes. Any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Travis D. Stice, could disrupt our operations. We do not have employment agreements with our executives and may not be able to assure their retention. Further, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nOperating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits.\nOur operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. In addition, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations.\nWe endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods, which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing, drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface, intermediate and production casing. Under our agreements with our vendors, to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties, (i) our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors\u2019 equipment while in their control and (ii) we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations, including pre-existing pollution and pollution which may result from fire, blowout, cratering, seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil, gas or other substances, as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids. In addition, we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendor-owned property that occurs in the well hole (except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage, rather than day work, basis) or as a result of the use of equipment, certain corrosive fluids, additives, chemicals or proppants. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements\nwith terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice, we historically have maintained insurance against some, but not all, of our business risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer. Also, insurance may no longer be available to us or, if it is, its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. We may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance.\nSince hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, we maintain insurance to protect against claims made for bodily injury and property damage, and that insurance includes coverage for clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. However, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the \u201coccurrence\u201d to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. We have limited coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events. In addition, these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in environmental laws could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows.\nPresident Biden has indicated that he is supportive of, and has issued executive orders promoting, various programs and initiatives designed to, among other things, curtail climate change, control the release of methane from new and existing oil and natural gas operations, and decarbonize electric generation and the transportation sector. It remains unclear what additional actions President Biden will take and what support he will have for any potential legislative changes from Congress. Further, it is uncertain to what extent any new environmental laws or regulations, or any repeal of existing environmental laws or regulations, may affect our business or operations. However, such actions could significantly increase our operating costs or impair our ability to explore and develop other projects, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur operations depend heavily on electrical power, internet and telecommunication infrastructure and information and computer systems. If any of these systems are compromised or unavailable, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are heavily dependent on electrical power, internet and telecommunications infrastructure and our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing\nand accounting data. If any of such infrastructure, systems or programs were to fail or become unavailable or compromised, or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, our ability to safely and effectively operate our business will be limited and any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers\u2019 operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, and processing activities. For example, the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. We maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets, however, we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nReferences in this section to \u201cus, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d shall mean Diamondback Energy, Inc. and Diamondback E&P LLC, collectively, unless otherwise specified.\nWe have relied in the past, and we may rely from time to time in the future, on borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. Unless we are able to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility with cash flow from operations and proceeds from equity or debt offerings, implementing our capital programs may require an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances. In addition, a reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility and the inability to otherwise obtain financing for our capital programs could require us to curtail our capital expenditures.\nWe have historically relied on availability under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. We expect that we will continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures with borrowings under the revolving credit facility, cash flow from operations and the proceeds from debt and equity offerings. In the past, we have created availability under the revolving credit facility by repaying outstanding borrowings with the proceeds from debt or equity offerings. We cannot assure you that we will choose to or be able to access the capital markets to repay any such future borrowings. Instead, we may be required or choose to finance our capital expenditures through additional debt issuances, which would increase our total amount of debt outstanding. If the availability under the revolving credit facility were reduced, and we were otherwise unable to secure other sources of financing, we may be required to curtail our capital expenditures, which could limit our ability to fund our drilling activities and acquisitions or otherwise finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.\nCertain of our debt instruments contain, and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; make certain investments; create liens; sell or transfer assets; issue preferred stock; merge or consolidate with another entity; pay dividends or make other distributions; create unrestricted subsidiaries; and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nUnder our revolving credit facility we are allowed, among other things, to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as \u201cunrestricted subsidiaries\u201d that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility. Under our revolving credit facility, we designated Viper, Viper\u2019s general partner, Viper\u2019s subsidiary, Rattler, Rattler\u2019s general partner and Rattler\u2019s subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, and upon such designation, they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the revolving credit facility, including the related guaranty. Further Viper, Viper\u2019s general partner, Viper\u2019s subsidiaries, Rattler, Rattler\u2019s general partner and Rattler\u2019s subsidiaries are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing our outstanding Senior Notes.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants and financial covenants contained in our and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt instruments. As an example, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a total net debt to capitalization ratio. The requirement that we and our subsidiaries comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our and our subsidiaries ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.\nA breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under the applicable debt instrument. If default occurs under our revolving credit facility, the lenders thereunder may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes. The lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness is structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, and our obligations are not obligations of any of our subsidiaries.\nOur senior indebtedness obligations are obligations exclusively of Diamondback Energy, Inc. and Diamondback E&P LLC, and not of any of our other subsidiaries. None of our other subsidiaries is a guarantor of our senior indebtedness. Any assets of those subsidiaries will not be directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes. Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, our senior indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries (other than Diamondback E&P LLC) and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish. For additional information regarding our subsidiaries outstanding debt as of December 31, 2021, see Note 11-Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including our senior notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. However, we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations. In the absence of such cash flows, we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends or distributions by certain of our subsidiaries to us. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend or distribution payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 revolving credit facilities and the indentures restrict, but in each case do not completely prohibit, us from doing so. Further, the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries\u2019 notes allow us to issue additional notes, incur certain other additional debt and to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt, which would be structurally senior to the senior notes. In addition, the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. If we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes (or with the guarantees thereof), including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables, the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of us or a guarantor. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nIf we experience liquidity concerns, we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nOur ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs.\nBorrowings under our, Viper LLC\u2019s and Rattler LLC\u2019s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our and our subsidiaries\u2019 revolving credit facilities. The terms of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 revolving credit facilities provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternate base rate tied to LIBOR. LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on multiple facts, including general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which indicated plans for multiple interest rate increases in 2022, and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. From time to time, we use interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposure with respect to our fixed and/or floating rate debt. Our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 1.67% during the year ended December 31, 2021. Viper LLC\u2019s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 2.35% during the year ended December 31, 2021. Rattler LLC\u2019s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 1.41% during the year ended December 31, 2021. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR), which we refer to as the FCA, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, and the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator, or no longer be representative immediately after 2021, for all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phase-out could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. Our current credit agreement provides for any\nchanges away from LIBOR to a successor rate to be based on prevailing or equivalent standards, however, changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the discontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nSubject to the limitations of applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, among other things; permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested; permits any of our stockholders, officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and provides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have (i) acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or (ii) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests.\nThese provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates.\nIf the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, your investment could lose value.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock. If an active public market for our common stock does not continue, the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. If there is a thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including our quarterly or annual operating results; changes in our earnings estimates; investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry; additions or departures of key personnel; changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors; our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections; changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and announcements of legislative or regulatory changes.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nThe declaration of dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations, and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders.\nOn February 13, 2018, we initiated payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock payable beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The decision to pay any future dividends, however, is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors. Our board of directors\u2019 determination with respect to any such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend, will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. Based on its evaluation of these factors, the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend, or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated, either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders.\nIn September 2021, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $2 billion of our outstanding common stock, of which $431 million had been repurchased through December 31, 2021. The stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued by the board of directors at any time.\nA change of control could limit our use of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d (as defined in the Code) may be subject to limitations on its ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) or tax credits generated prior to the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase in the ownership of a corporation\u2019s stock totaling more than 50 percentage points by one or more \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of a corporation\u2019s pre-change NOLs or tax credits that could be utilized to offset taxable income in any future taxable year. The amount of the limitation is generally equal to the value of the corporation\u2019s stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by an interest rate, referred to as the long-term tax-exempt rate, periodically promulgated by the IRS. This limitation, however, may be significantly increased if there is \u201cnet unrealized built-in gain\u201d in the assets of the corporation undergoing the ownership change.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an NOL carryforward of approximately $2.5 billion and tax credits of $4 million for federal income tax purposes. Due to an ownership change on March 17, 2021 in conjunction with our acquisition of QEP in an all-stock transaction, our NOLs and tax credits, including those acquired from QEP, are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code. However, we have determined that our fair market value and our net unrealized built-in gain position resulted in a significant increase in our Section 382 limitation. Accordingly, we believe that the application of Section 382 as a result of this ownership change will not have an adverse effect on our ability to utilize our NOLs and credits.\nFuture changes in our stock ownership, however, could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Any such ownership change may limit our ability to offset taxable income arising after such an ownership change with NOLs or other tax attributes generated prior to such an ownership change, possibly substantially.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders; limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent; the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our bylaws; the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors; the requirement that\nthe affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our certificate of incorporation; and the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.",

    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs, and expected performance. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. See Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We operate in two operating segments: (i) the upstream segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas and (ii) through our subsidiary, Rattler, the midstream operations segment, which is focused on ownership, operation, development and acquisition of the midstream infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nWe operate under a strategic approach that focuses predominantly on enhancing return through our low-cost development strategy of resource conversion, capital allocation and continued improvements in operational and cost efficiencies. We are also committed to delivering results in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.\n2021 Financial and Operating Highlights\n\u2022We recorded net income of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Our average production was 137,002 MBOE/d during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2021, we drilled 175 gross horizontal wells in the Midland Basin and 41 gross horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin.\n\u2022We turned 275 gross operated horizontal wells (including 207 in the Midland Basin and 64 in the Delaware Basin) to production and had capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of $1.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022The average lateral length for the wells completed during the year ended December 31, 2021 was 10,602 feet.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 445,848 net acres, which primarily consisted of approximately 265,562 net acres in the Midland Basin and approximately 148,588 net acres in the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2021, we had an estimated 9,314 gross horizontal locations that we believe to be economic at $50.00 per Bbl WTI. In addition, our publicly traded subsidiary Viper owns mineral interests underlying approximately 930,871 gross acres and 27,027 net royalty acres in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. Approximately 54% of these net royalty acres are operated by us.\n\u2022Our cash operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $9.46 per BOE, including lease operating expenses of $4.12 per BOE, cash general and administrative expenses of $0.69 per BOE and production and ad valorem taxes and gathering and transportation expenses of 4.65 per BOE.\n2021 Transactions and Recent Developments\n2021 Acquisition Activity and Recent Transactions\nOn February 26, 2021, we completed the Guidon Acquisition, which included approximately 32,500 net acres in the Northern Midland Basin, in exchange for 10.68 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and $375 million of cash.\nOn March 17, 2021, we completed the QEP Merger. The addition of QEP\u2019s assets increased our net acreage in the Midland Basin by approximately 49,000 net acres. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we issued approximately 12.12 million shares of our common stock to the former QEP stockholders, with a total value of approximately $987 million on the closing date.\nOn October 1, 2021, Viper completed the acquisition of certain mineral and royalty interests from Swallowtail Royalties LLC and Swallowtail Royalties II LLC (the \u201cSwallowtail entities\u201d) which included certain mineral and royalty interests for 15.25 million of Viper\u2019s common units and approximately $225 million in cash (the \u201cSwallowtail Acquisition\u201d). The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through a combination of cash on hand and approximately $190 million of borrowings under Viper LLC\u2019s revolving credit facility.\nOn October 5, 2021, Rattler and a private affiliate of an investment fund formed a joint venture entity, Remuda Midstream Holdings LLC (the \u201cWTG joint venture\u201d). Rattler contributed approximately $104 million in cash for a 25% membership interest in the WTG joint venture, which then completed the acquisition of a majority interest in WTG Midstream LLC (\u201cWTG Midstream\u201d).\n2021 Divestiture Activity\nOn June 3, 2021 and June 7, 2021, respectively, we closed transactions to divest certain non-core Permian assets, including over 7,000 net acres of non-core Southern Midland Basin acreage in Upton county, Texas and approximately 1,300 net acres of non-core, non-operated Delaware Basin assets in Lea county, New Mexico, for combined net cash proceeds of $82 million, after customary closing adjustments. We used our net proceeds from these transactions toward debt reduction.\nOn October 21, 2021, we completed the divestiture of our Williston Basin oil and natural gas assets, consisting of approximately 95,000 net acres acquired in the QEP Merger, for net cash proceeds of approximately $586 million after customary closing adjustments. We used our net proceeds from this transaction toward debt reduction.\nOn November 1, 2021, we completed the sale of certain gas gathering assets to Brazos Delaware Gas, LLC, which we refer to as Brazos, for net cash proceeds of approximately $54 million, after customary closing adjustments.\nOn December 1, 2021, we completed the sale of certain water midstream assets with a carrying value of approximately $160 million to Rattler in exchange for cash proceeds of approximately $160 million.\nOn November 1, 2021, Rattler completed the sale of its gas gathering assets to Brazos for net cash proceeds of approximately $83 million at closing, after customary closing adjustments, and an aggregate of $10 million in contingent payments.\nSee Note 4-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional discussion of these transactions.\nDebt Transactions\nIssuances of Notes\nOn March 24, 2021, Diamondback Energy, Inc. issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of 0.900% Senior Notes due March 24, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d), $900 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Senior Notes due March 24, 2031 (the \u201c2031 Notes\u201d) and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 4.400% Senior Notes due March 24, 2051 (the \u201c2051 Notes\u201d) and received proceeds, net of $24 million in debt issuance costs and discounts, of $2.18 billion. The net proceeds were primarily used to fund the redemption of other senior notes outstanding as discussed further below.\nRedemption of Notes\nThe net proceeds from the March 2021 Notes discussed above were primarily used to fund the repurchase of $1.65 billion in fair value carrying amount of the QEP Notes that remained outstanding at the effective time of the QEP Merger for total cash consideration of $1.7 billion, and $368 million principal amount of 2025 Senior Notes, for total cash consideration of $381 million. Giving effect to the repurchase of the 2023 Notes discussed below, these refinancing transactions are expected to result in an estimated annual interest cost savings of approximately $40 million in addition to an estimated $60 to $80 million of previously announced expected annual cost synergies from the QEP Merger.\nIn June 2021, we redeemed the remaining $191 million principal amount of outstanding legacy 4.625% senior notes due September 1, 2021 of Energen Corporation (\u201cEnergen\u201d).\nIn August 2021 we redeemed the remaining $432 million principal amount of our outstanding 5.375% 2025 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 102.688% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. We funded the redemption with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOn November 1, 2021, we redeemed the aggregate $650 million principal amount of our outstanding 2023 Notes with the proceeds received from the divestiture of our Williston Basin assets and cash on hand.\nFor additional discussion of our 2021 debt transactions and the amendment to the second amended and restated credit facility, see Note 11-Debt.\nFourth Quarter 2021 Dividend Declaration and Increase\nOn February 18, 2022, our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $0.60 per share of common stock, payable on March 11, 2022 to our stockholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2022, representing a 20% increase per share from the previously paid quarterly dividend.\nStock and Unit Repurchase Programs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately $431 million of Diamondback common stock, and as of December 31, 2021, $1.6 billion remained available for future purchases under our common stock repurchase program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Viper repurchased approximately $46 million of common units under its repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, $80 million remained available for use to repurchase common units under Viper\u2019s common unit repurchase program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Rattler repurchased approximately $48 million of common units under its repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, $88 million remained available for use to repurchase common units under Rattler\u2019s common unit repurchase program.\nSee \u201c-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for additional discussion.\nCOVID-19 and Effects on Commodity Prices\nIn early March 2020, oil prices dropped sharply and continued to decline, briefly reaching negative levels, as a result of multiple factors affecting the supply and demand in global oil and natural gas markets, including (i) actions taken by OPEC members and other exporting nations impacting commodity price and production levels and (ii) a significant decrease in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for oil and natural gas increased during 2021, as many restrictions on conducting business implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were lifted due to improved treatments and availability of vaccinations in the U.S. and globally. As a result, oil and natural gas market prices have improved during 2021 in response to the increase in demand. During 2021 and 2020, the posted price for West Texas intermediate light sweet crude oil, or NYMEX WTI, has ranged from $(37.63) to $84.65 Bbl, and the NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas has ranged from $1.48 to $6.31 per MMBtu. On January 18, 2022, the closing NYMEX WTI price for crude oil was $85.43 per Bbl and the closing NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas was $4.28 per MMBtu. The emergence of the Delta COVID-19 variant in the latter part of 2021 and the subsequent surge of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, however, contributed to economic and pricing volatility as industry and market participants evaluated industry conditions and production outlook. Further, on January 4, 2021, OPEC and its non-OPEC allies, known collectively as OPEC+, agreed to continue their program (commenced in August of 2021) of gradual monthly output increases in February 2022, raising its output target by 400,000 Bbls per day, which is expected to further boost oil supply in response to rising demand. In its report issued on February 10, 2022, OPEC noted its expectation that world oil demand will rise by 4.15 million Bbls per day in 2022, as the global economy continues to post a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this demand outlook is expected to underpin oil prices, already seen at a seven-year high in February 2022, we cannot predict any future volatility in commodity prices or demand for crude oil.\nDespite the recovery in commodity prices and rising demand, we kept our production relatively flat during 2021, using excess cash flow for debt repayment and/or return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program.\nOutlook\nDuring 2021, we continued building on our execution track record, generating free cash flow while keeping capital costs under control, and our efficiency gains, particularly in the Midland Basin drilling and completion programs, were able to mitigate certain inflationary pressures on well costs and led to a total capital expenditure amount of $1.5 billion down 11% from our guidance presented in April of 2021. We expect to continue to build on these operational efficiencies by controlling the variable portion of our operating and capital costs, which we believe will help mitigate the inflationary pressures seen across our business. We remain committed to capital discipline by maintaining flat oil production in 2022 and expect to maintain our best-in-class capital efficiency and cost structure. We expect to be in a position to continue to deliver on the recently announced enhanced capital return program, where we expect to distribute at least 50% of our quarterly free cash flow to our stockholders. Our capital return program is currently focused on our sustainable and growing dividend and a combination of stock repurchases and variable dividends. We expect to remain flexible on returning capital to our stockholders, depending on which method our board of directors believes presents the best return of capital to our stockholders at the relevant time.\nIn the Midland Basin, we continued to have positive results across our core development areas located within Midland, Martin, Howard, Glasscock and Andrews counties, where development has primarily focused on drilling long-lateral, multi-well pads targeting the Spraberry and Wolfcamp formations.\nIn the Delaware Basin, we have now drilled and completed a significant number of wells in Pecos, Reeves and Ward counties targeting the Wolfcamp A, which we believe has been de-risked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target. In 2022, we expect to focus development on these areas.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 drilling rigs and between three and four completion crews in 2022 on average across our current acreage position in the Midland and Delaware Basins.\nEnvironmental Responsibility Initiatives and Highlights\nIn February 2021, we announced significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental, social responsibility and governance, or ESG, performance and disclosure, including Scope 1 and methane emission intensity reduction targets. Our goals include the reduction of our Scope 1 greenhouse gas intensity by at least 50% and methane intensity by at least 70%, in each case by 2024 from the 2019 levels. To further underscore our commitment to carbon neutrality, we have also implemented our \u201cNet Zero Now\u201d initiative under which, effective January 1, 2021, we strive to produce every hydrocarbon molecule with zero Scope 1 emissions. To the extent our greenhouse gas and methane intensity targets do not eliminate our carbon footprint, we have purchased carbon credits to offset the remaining emissions. We have also increased the weighting of ESG metrics in our annual short-term incentive compensation plan to motivate our executives to advance our environmental responsibility goals.\nIn September 2021, we announced our long-term goal to end routine flaring by 2025 and a long-term target to source over 65% of our water used for drilling and completion operations from recycled sources by 2025. With respect to flaring, we flared 1.55% of our gross natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year ended 2021, we flared 1.45% of our gross natural gas production, down 26% from 2020.\n2022 Capital Budget\nWe have currently budgeted 2022 total capital spend of $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion. Should commodity prices weaken, we intend to act responsibly and, consistent with our prior practices, reduce capital spending. If commodity prices strengthen, we intend to maintain flat oil production, pay down indebtedness and return cash to our stockholders.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion focuses primarily on a comparison of the results of operations between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The midstream operations segment\u2019s revenues and operating expenses were not significant to our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. .For a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021), which is incorporated in this report by reference from such prior report on Form 10-K.\nThe following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated:\n(1)Bbl equivalents are calculated using a conversion rate of six Mcf per Bbl.\n(2)Hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices and include gains and losses on cash settlements for matured commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting. Hedged prices exclude gains or losses resulting from the early settlement of commodity derivative contracts.\nProduction Data\nSubstantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. The following tables provides information on the mix of our production for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nOil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Revenues. Our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes.\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues increased by approximately $4.0 billion, or 145%, to $6.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Higher average oil prices, and to a lesser extent natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, contributed $3.3 billion of the total increase. The remainder of the overall change is due to a 25% increase in combined volumes sold.\nHigher commodity prices during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflect a recovery from historically low prices experienced in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic as discussed in \u201c-2021 Transactions and Recent Developments\u201d above. The increase in production for 2021 compared to 2020 resulted primarily from the Guidon Acquisition and QEP Merger during the first quarter of 2021 and an overall recovery in our drilling and production activities after curtailments in the second quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to hold our oil production levels flat during 2022.\nLease Operating Expenses. The following table shows lease operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nLease operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $140 million, or $0.25 per BOE, primarily due to an increase in production between periods driven by the Guidon Acquisition and the QEP Merger in the first quarter of 2021. The increase on a per BOE basis is primarily related to the Williston Basin assets acquired in the QEP Merger which had higher lease operating costs per BOE on average than our historical properties. We completed the divestiture of the Williston Basin properties in October 2021.\nIncluding the impact of our acquisition and divestiture activity in 2021 and future production plans, our total lease operating expenses in 2022 are expected to range from approximately $539 million to $618 million.\nProduction and Ad Valorem Tax Expense. The following table shows production and ad valorem tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nIn general, production taxes are directly related to production revenues. Production taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $214 million, or $1.32 per BOE. The increase in production taxes is attributable to an increase in commodity prices, as well as an increase in overall production due to assets acquired in 2021. The current year increase on a per BOE basis is primarily driven by an increase in current year commodity prices. Production taxes as a percentage of production revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to the acquired Williston Basin properties which have a higher production tax rate than our other properties. We completed the divestiture of the Williston Basin properties in October 2021.\nAd valorem taxes are based, among other factors, on property values driven by prior year commodity prices. Ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $16 million primarily due to additional properties acquired in the Guidon Acquisition and the QEP Merger.\nWe expect production taxes to be approximately between 7% and 8% of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenue during 2022.\nGathering and Transportation Expense. The following table shows gathering and transportation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase for gathering and transportation expenses are primarily attributable to the increase in production between periods. The current year increase on a per BOE basis is primarily driven by production added from the assets acquired in the QEP Merger which, in general, had higher average gathering and transportation costs per BOE than our historical properties, particularly those QEP assets located in the Williston Basin, which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2021. After giving effect to the 2021 acquisition and divestiture activities, we expect gathering and transportation expenses to range from approximately $212 to $243 million in 2022.\nMidstream Services Expense. The following table shows midstream services expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nMidstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems, natural gas lift, compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we and Rattler divested our natural gas gathering and transportation assets. Midstream services expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $16 million primarily due to decreased maintenance costs, partially offset by increased fees for use of third party disposal systems.\nDepreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. The following table provides the components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe decrease in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted primarily from a reduction in the average depletion rate partially offset by increased production in 2021. The decline in rate resulted primarily from higher SEC oil prices utilized in the reserve calculations during 2021, lengthening the economic life of the reserve base and resulting in higher projected remaining reserve volumes on our wells.\nImpairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties. No impairment expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition, we recorded the oil and natural gas properties acquired at fair value. Pursuant to SEC guidance, we determined the fair value of the properties acquired in the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition clearly exceeded the related full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, we requested and received a waiver from the SEC to exclude the acquired properties from the first quarter 2021 ceiling test calculation. As a result, no impairment expense related to the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Had we not received the waiver from the SEC, an impairment charge of approximately $1.1 billion would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2021. The properties acquired in the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition had total unamortized costs at March 31, 2021 of $3.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.\nAs a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices during 2020, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $6.0 billion which is included in accumulated depletion, depreciation, amortization and impairment on our consolidated balance sheet. Impairment charges affect our results of operations but do not reduce our cash flow. In addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved reserves, future development costs, transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods. If the trailing 12-month commodity prices fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters, we may have material write-downs in subsequent quarters. See Note 8-Property and Equipment for further details regarding factors that impact the impairment of oil and natural gas properties.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. The following table shows general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $58 million primarily due to additional payroll and other employee driven costs of $32 million related to the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition as well as $10 million of additional expense related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. Additionally, equity compensation for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $14 million compared to the same period in 2020.\nWe expect cash general and administrative expenses to range from approximately $87 million to $110 million in 2022, and non-cash stock-based compensation to range from approximately $54 million to $69 million in 2022.\nMerger and Integration Expense. The following table shows merger and integration expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTotal merger and integration expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes $69 million in costs incurred for the QEP Merger and $9 million in costs incurred for the Guidon Acquisition. The QEP Merger related expenses primarily consist of $39 million in severance costs and $30 million in banking, legal and advisory fees, and the Guidon Acquisition related expenses consist primarily of advisory and legal fees. See Note 4-Acquisitions and Divestitures for further details regarding the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition.\nNet Interest Expense. The following table shows net interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nNet interest expense increased by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase primarily consisted of (i) $47 million in interest costs on the newly issued March 2021 Notes (ii) $25 million due to incurring a full year of interest expense in 2021 related to our May 2020 Notes and Rattler\u2019s 5.625% Senior Notes due 2025, and (iii) to a lesser extent, interest expense incurred on the QEP Notes that remained outstanding following the QEP Merger completed in March 2021. These increases were partially offset by (i) $33 million in additional capitalized interest costs, (ii) interest cost savings of $23 million on the repurchases of our 2025 Senior Notes in March 2021 and August 2021, (iii) $8 million on the repurchase of our 4.625% senior notes of Energen (iv) a $9 million reduction in borrowings under our revolving credit agreements during 2021, and (v) to a lesser extent, interest savings on the repurchase of our 2023 Notes in November 2021. We expect interest expense, net of interest income to range from approximately $148 million to $178 million in 2022. See Note 11-Debt for further details regarding outstanding borrowings and interest expense.\nDerivative Instruments. The following table shows the net gain (loss) on derivative instruments and the net cash received (paid) on settlements of derivative instruments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(1)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes cash paid on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $16 million.\n(2)The year ended December 31, 2020 includes cash received on commodity contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $17 million.\n(3)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes cash received on interest rate swap contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of $80 million.\nWe are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. We have not designated our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. As a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned \u201cGain (loss) on derivative instruments, net.\u201d As part of the QEP Merger, we received by novation from QEP certain derivative instruments which are included on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.\nWe have designated certain of our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. As a result, gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and no gain or loss is recognized due to hedge effectiveness. Changes in fair value are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the 2029 Notes in the consolidated balance sheet. Beginning on December 1, 2021, we began recording semi-annual cash settlements of these interest rate swaps in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAt December 31, 2021, we have a short-term derivative asset of $13 million, a long-term derivative asset of $4 million, a short-term derivative liability due in 2022 of $174 million and a long-term derivative liability due in 2023 of $29 million.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. The following table shows the provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe changes in our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 were primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Sources and Uses of Cash\nHistorically, our primary sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, proceeds from our public equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and sales of non-core assets. Our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity consisting of $0.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6 billion available under our credit facility. As discussed below, our capital budget for 2022 is $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion. Further, we have $45 million of senior notes maturities in the next 12 months.\nOur working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility. We may draw on our revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, debt service obligations and repayment of debt maturities, stock repurchase program and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.\nFuture cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. In order to mitigate this volatility, we entered into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions, all of which are participants in our credit facility, hedging a portion of our estimated future crude oil and natural gas production through the end of 2023 as discussed further in Note 15-Derivatives and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Commodity Price Risk. The level of our hedging activity and duration of the financial instruments employed depend on our desired cash flow protection, available hedge prices, the magnitude of our capital program and our operating strategy.\nAs we pursue our business and financial strategy, we regularly consider which capital resources, including cash flow and equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. Our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. Continued prolonged volatility in the capital, financial and/or credit markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the depressed commodity markets and/or adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our access to, or increase our cost of, capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Although the Company expects that its sources of funding will be adequate to fund its short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nCash Flow\nOur cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented below:\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce. Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. See Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d above.\nThe increase in operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily resulted from (i) an increase of $4.0 billion in our total revenues, and (ii) receipt of $152 million in refunds of income taxes receivable related to the carryback of federal net operating losses and the accelerated refund of minimum tax credits allowed under the CARES Act in 2020. These net cash inflows were partially offset by (i) a reduction of $1.5 billion due to making net cash payments of $1.2 billion on our derivative contracts in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to receiving net cash of $250 million on our derivative contracts in the year ended December 31, 2020, (ii) an increase in our cash operating expenses of approximately $550 million primarily due to the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition, and (iii) other working capital changes, primarily due to recording increases in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued capital expenditure activity stemming from the QEP Merger and the Guidon Acquisition in 2021. See \u201c-Results of Operations\u201d for discussion of significant changes in our revenues and expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The majority of our net cash used for investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was for the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, including the acquisition of certain leasehold interests as part of the Guidon Acquisition. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our Williston Basin assets, leasehold acreage and other gathering assets discussed in Note 4-Acquisitions and Divestitures.\nThe majority of our net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was for drilling and completion costs in conjunction with our development program. Our capital expenditures for each period are discussed further below.\nCapital Expenditure Activities\nOur capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and equity method investments (on a cash basis) were as follows for the specified period:\n(1) During the year ended December 31, 2021, in conjunction with our development program, we drilled 216 gross (203 net) operated horizontal wells, of which 175 gross (165 net) wells were in the Midland Basin and 41 gross (38 net) wells were in the Delaware Basin, and turned 275 gross (258 net) operated horizontal wells to production, of which 207 gross (194 net) were in the Midland Basin and 64 gross (61 net) wells were in the Delaware Basin.\n(2) During the year ended December 31, 2020, in conjunction with our development program, we drilled 208 gross (195 net) operated horizontal wells, of which 133 gross (125 net) wells were in the Midland Basin and 75 gross (70 net) wells were in the Delaware Basin, and turned 171 gross (159 net) operated horizontal wells to production, of which 93 gross (85 net) were in the Midland Basin and 78 gross (74 net) wells were in the Delaware Basin.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.8 billion compared to net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $37 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the amount used in financing activities was primarily attributable to (i) $3.2 billion paid for the repurchase of outstanding principal on certain senior notes as discussed in \u201c-Repurchases of Notes\u201d below, as well as $178 million of additional premiums paid in connection with the repurchases, (ii) $525 million of repurchases as part of the share and unit repurchase programs, (iii) $312 million of dividends paid to stockholders, and (iv) $112 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. The cash outflows were partially offset by (i) $2.2 billion in proceeds from the March 2021 Notes, (ii) $313 million of borrowings under our and our subsidiaries\u2019 credit facilities, net of repayments and (iii) $22 million in net cash receipts from the early settlement of interest rate swaps and commodity derivative contracts that contained an other-than-insignificant financing element.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to $348 million of repayments, net of borrowings, on our credit facilities, $239 million in aggregate repayments on the Energen Notes and Viper Notes, $236 million in dividends paid to stockholders, $98 million of share repurchases as part of our stock repurchase program, and $93 million in distributions to non-controlling interest. These cash outlays were partially offset by net proceeds of $997 million from the issuance of the May 2020 Notes and the Rattler Notes during 2020.\nCapital Resources\nRevolving Credit Facilities and Other Debt Instruments\nAs of December 31, 2021, our debt, including the debt of Viper and Rattler, consists of approximately $6.2 billion in aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior notes, $499 million in aggregate outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facilities and $58 million in outstanding amounts due under our DrillCo Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2021, we have total principal payments due on our outstanding senior notes, including those of Viper and Rattler, of $45 million in 2022, $1.2 billion cumulatively in the years 2023 through 2024, $2.1 billion cumulatively in the years 2025 and 2026, and $3.4 billion thereafter. Additionally, we expect to incur future cash interest costs on these senior notes of approximately $177 million in 2022, $371 million in the years from 2023 through 2024, $277 million in the years from 2025 through 2026, and $961 million between 2027 and 2051.\nOn June 2, 2021, we entered into a twelfth amendment, or the Amendment, to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which, among other things, decreased the total revolving loan commitments from $2.0 billion to $1.6 billion, which may be increased in an amount up to $1.0 billion (for a total maximum commitment amount of $2.6 billion) upon election of the Borrower, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions). As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $1.6 billion available for future borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\nViper\u2019s Revolving Credit Facility\nViper\u2019s credit agreement, as amended to date, provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $2.0 billion, with a borrowing base of $580 million as of December 31, 2021, based on the Viper\u2019s oil and natural gas reserves and other factors. At December 31, 2021, Viper had elected a commitment amount of $500 million on its credit agreement with $304 million of outstanding borrowings. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Operating Company\u2019s revolving credit facility was 2.35%. Viper\u2019s Revolving credit facility matures in 2025.\nRattler\u2019s Revolving Credit Facility\nRattler\u2019s credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $600 million, which is expandable to $1.0 billion upon its election, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. As of December 31, 2021, there was $195 million of outstanding borrowings under Rattler\u2019s revolving credit facility. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement was 1.41% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Rattler\u2019s revolving credit facility matures in 2024.\nDuring 2021, we issued an aggregate $2.2 billion of senior notes and redeemed $3.2 billion of senior notes outstanding.\nFor additional discussion of our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2021, see Note 11-Debt.\nSubject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance our maturing debt. The availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned by credit rating agencies, among other factors.\nWe are currently in compliance, and expect to continue to be, with all financial maintenance covenants in our debt instruments.\nDebt Ratings\nWe receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and production growth opportunities. Our credit rating from Standard and Poor\u2019s Global Ratings Services is BBB-. Our credit rating from Fitch Investor Services is BBB. Our credit rating from Moody\u2019s Investor Services is Baa3. Any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements.\nCapital Requirements\nIn addition to future operating expenses and working capital commitments discussed in -Results of Operations, our primary short and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of (i) capital expenditures, (ii) payments of other contractual obligations and (iii) cash commitments for dividends and share repurchases as discussed below.\nBased upon current oil and natural gas prices and production expectations for 2022, we believe that our cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through the 12-month period following the filing of this report and thereafter. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. We cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Further, our 2022 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions.\n2022 Capital Spending Plan\nOur board of directors approved a 2022 capital budget for drilling, midstream and infrastructure of $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion maintaining our annualized fourth quarter 2021 cash capital expenditure guidance presented in November of 2021. We estimate that, of these expenditures, approximately:\n\u2022$1.56 billion to $1.67 billion will be spent primarily on drilling 270 to 290 gross (248 to 267 net) horizontal wells and completing 260 to 280 gross (240 to 258 net) horizontal wells across our operated and non-operated leasehold acreage in the Northern Midland and Southern Delaware Basins, with an average lateral length of approximately 10,200 feet;\n\u2022$80 million to $100 million will be spent on midstream infrastructure, excluding joint venture investments; and\n\u2022$110 million to $130 million will be spent on infrastructure and environmental expenditures, excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions.\nWe do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted.\nThe amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. We were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews at December 31, 2021 and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 rigs and between three and four completion crews on average in 2022, as we continue to execute on our strategy to hold oil production flat while using cash flow from operations to reduce debt, strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our stockholders. We will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence and our capital expenditure budget up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions.\nOther Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2021, our other significant contractual obligations consist primarily of (i) minimum transportation commitments totaling $878 million, (ii) asset retirement obligations totaling $171 million, and (iii) minimum purchase commitment for quantities of sand used in our drilling operations totaling $77 million. We expect to make aggregate payments of approximately $105 million for these commitments during 2022. See Note 9-Asset Retirement Obligations and Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion of these and other contractual obligations and commitments.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nWe paid common stock dividends of $312 million and $236 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. On February 18, 2022, our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $0.60 per share of common stock, payable on March 11, 2022 to our stockholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2022. The decision to pay any future dividends is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors.\nIn September 2021, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $2 billion of our outstanding common stock. The stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued by the board of directors at any time. We repurchased approximately $431 million of our common stock under this program during the year ended December 31, 2021, and have $1.6 billion remaining for future repurchases under the repurchase program at December 31, 2021 See Note 12-Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share for further discussion of the repurchase program.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nIn connection with the merger of certain of the Company\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries in an internal subsidiary restructuring on June 30, 2021, Diamondback E&P became the successor borrower to Diamondback O&G LLC (\u201cO&G\u201d) under the credit agreement, the successor issuer of Energen\u2019s 7.125% Medium-term Notes, Series B, due February 15, 2028 and Energen\u2019s 7.32% Medium-term Notes, Series A, due July 28, 2022, and the sole guarantor under the indentures governing the December 2019 Notes, the May 2020 Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes and the March 2021 Notes.\nGuarantees are \u201cfull and unconditional,\u201d as that term is used in Regulation S-X, Rule 3-10(b)(3), except that such guarantees will be released or terminated in certain circumstances set forth in the IG Indenture and the 2025 Indenture, such as, with certain exceptions, (i) in the event Diamondback E&P (or all or substantially all of its assets) is sold or disposed of, (ii) in the event Diamondback E&P ceases to be a guarantor of or otherwise be an obligor under certain other indebtedness, and (iii) in connection with any covenant defeasance, legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the relevant indenture. The 2025 Indenture was terminated in connection with the early redemption of the remaining $432 million principal amount of our 2025 Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2021.\nDiamondback E&P\u2019s guarantees of the December 2019 Notes, the May 2020 Notes and the March 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of its future subordinated indebtedness, equal in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness, including its obligations under its revolving credit facility, and effectively subordinated to any of its existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.\nThe rights of holders of the Senior Notes against Diamondback E&P may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit Diamondback E&P\u2019s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of Diamondback E&P. Moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for Diamondback Energy, Inc., as the parent, and Diamondback E&P, as the guarantor subsidiary, on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between the parent and the guarantor subsidiary and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor. The information is presented in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13-01 under the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the guarantor subsidiary operated as an independent entity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nCertain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nWe consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nOil and Natural Gas Accounting and Reserves\nWe account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting, which is dependent on the estimation of proved reserves to determine the rate at which we record depletion on our oil and natural gas properties and whether the value of our evaluated oil and natural gas properties is permanently impaired based on the quarterly full cost ceiling impairment test. Further, we utilize estimated proved reserves to assign fair value to acquired proved oil and natural gas properties including mineral and royalty interests. As such, we consider the estimation of proved reserves to be a critical accounting estimate.\nOil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and their associated future net cash flows. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. Significant inputs included in the calculation of future net cash flows include our estimate of operating and development costs, anticipated production of proved reserves and other relevant data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time, and reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. If such changes are material, they could significantly affect future depletion of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material. Revisions of previous reserve estimates accounted for approximately $719 million, or 6% of the change in the standardized measure of our total reserves from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. No impairments were recorded on for our proved oil and gas properties during the year ended December 31, 2021; however, material impairments were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as discussed further in Note 8-Property and Equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Due to an increase in the historical 12-month average trailing SEC prices for oil and natural throughout 2021 and into 2022, we are not currently projecting a full cost ceiling impairment in the first quarter of 2022.\nAdditionally, costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. We assess all items classified as unevaluated property (on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant) on an annual basis for possible impairment. This assessment is subjective and includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent of the operator to drill, remaining lease term with the current operator; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. At December 31, 2021, our unevaluated properties totaled $8 billion, which consisted of 214,151 net undeveloped leasehold acres with approximately 41,855 net acres set to expire in 2022. We did not record any impairment on our unevaluated properties during the year ended December 31, 2021, but any such future impairment could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nCommodity Derivatives\nFrom time to time, we use commodity derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas. We exercise significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, the level of production volumes to include in our commodity derivative contracts, the prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts and the counterparties\u2019 creditworthiness. We do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nWe have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash change in fair value on derivative instruments for each period in the consolidated statements of operations. We are also required to recognize our derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value with such amounts classified as current or long-term based on their anticipated settlement dates. The accounting for the changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation, and is generally determined using various inputs and assumptions including established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other things, futures prices, time to maturity, implied volatilities and counterparty credit risk.\nThese fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions, including any deferred premiums, that are with the same counterparty and are subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement. Changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur.\nSee Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Commodity Price Risk for additional sensitivity analysis of our open derivative positions at December 31, 2021.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values.\nWe make various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Fair value estimates are determined based on information that existed at the time of the acquisition, utilizing expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant. When market-observable prices are not available to value assets and liabilities, the Company may use the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management\u2019s assumptions.\nThe most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. The assumptions made in performing these valuations include future production volumes, future commodity prices and costs, future operating and development activities, projections of oil and gas reserves and a weighted average cost of capital rate. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. In addition, when appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of natural gas and oil properties within the same regions, and use that data as a proxy for fair market value; for example, the amount a willing buyer and seller would enter into in exchange for such properties. Changes in key assumptions may cause the acquisition accounting to be revised, including the recognition of additional goodwill or discount on acquisition. There is no assurance the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation will occur as initially expected. See Note 4-Acquisitions and Divestitures of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the QEP Merger and Guidon Acquisition, including any significant changes in these estimates from the date of acquisition.\nEstimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. In addition, differences between the future commodity prices when acquiring assets and the historical 12-month average trailing price to calculate ceiling test impairments of upstream assets may impact net earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nThe amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, and provincial tax jurisdictions. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required, entails that we make estimates of, and assumptions about, future events, including the pattern of reversal of taxable temporary differences and our future income from operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had established a total valuation allowance of $315 million, including a valuation allowance for the full amount of Viper\u2019s deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance remains in place based on the uncertainty of future events, including Viper\u2019s ability to generate future taxable income in excess of special allocations to be made to Diamondback, and management considered this and other factors in evaluating the realizability of Viper\u2019s deferred tax assets. No such valuation allowance was determined to be necessary against Rattler\u2019s deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 based on the relative predictability of its future income stream based on its long term customer contracts. Any changes in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if Viper\u2019s or Rattler\u2019s deferred tax assets will be realized, including projected future income, could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the determination to record a valuation allowance on certain tax attributes acquired from QEP and certain state NOL carryforwards which the Company does not believe are realizable prior to expiration was based on an evaluation of available positive and negative evidence, including the annual limitation imposed by IRC Section 382 subsequent to an ownership change and the anticipated timing of reversal of the Company\u2019s deferred tax liabilities in the applicable jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2021, although the Company\u2019s recent cumulative losses represent negative evidence regarding reliance on future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, our balance of taxable temporary differences anticipated to reverse within the carryforward period provides significant positive evidence for the determination that our remaining deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Any change in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if our deferred tax assets will be realized, including projected future taxable income primarily related to the excess of book carrying value over tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties, could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on uncertain tax positions and assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. These assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. At December 31, 2021, our uncertain tax positions were insignificant, however, material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for recent accounting pronouncements and accounting policies not yet adopted, if any.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPlease read Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, some of which are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets under GAAP.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nCommodity Price Risk\nOur major market risk exposure in our exploration and production business is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production. Pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years. Although demand and market prices for oil and natural gas have recently increased substantially due to rising energy use, easing of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, availability of treatments and vaccines in the U.S. and globally and improvements in the U.S. and global economic activity, we cannot predict events that may lead to future commodity price volatility. Further, the prices we receive for production depend on many other factors outside of our control.\nWe use derivatives, including swaps, basis swaps, swaptions, roll hedges, costless collars, puts and basis puts, to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a net liability derivative position of $168 million related to our commodity price derivatives. Utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our commodity price derivatives as of December 31, 2021, a 10% increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net liability position by $149 million to $317 million, while a 10% decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have reduced the net liability derivative position by $117 million to $51 million. However, any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase, respectively, in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument.\nIn our midstream operations business, we have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low commodity prices may cause us or Rattler\u2019s other customers to delay drilling or shut in production, which would reduce the volumes available for gathering and processing by our infrastructure assets. If we or Rattler\u2019s other customers delay drilling or temporarily shut in production due to persistently low commodity prices or for any other reason, our revenue in the midstream operations segment could decrease, as Rattler\u2019s commercial agreements do not contain minimum volume commitments.\nFor additional information on our open commodity derivative instruments at December 31, 2021, see Note 15-Derivatives.\nCounterparty and Customer Credit Risk\nOur principal exposures to credit risk are due to the concentration of receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $598 million at December 31, 2021), and to a lesser extent, receivables resulting from joint interest receivables (approximately $72 million at December 31, 2021).\nWe do not require our customers to post collateral, and the failure or inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us due to their liquidity issues, bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\nJoint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill. We have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities and changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. The terms of our credit agreement provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.5% and 3-month LIBOR plus 1.0%) or LIBOR, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.25% to 1.125% per annum in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.25% to 2.125% per annum in the case of LIBOR, in each case based on the pricing level. The pricing level depends on certain rating agencies\u2019 ratings of our long-term senior unsecure debt. We believe significant interest rate changes would not have a material near-term impact on our future earnings or cash flows. For additional information on our variable interest rate debt at December 31, 2021, see Note 11-Debt.\nHistorically, we have at times used interest rate swaps and treasury locks to reduce our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with our revolving credit facility and changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2021, we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $1.2 billion to manage the impact of market interest rates on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges of the Company\u2019s $1.2 billion 3.50% fixed rate senior notes due 2029 whereby we will receive the fixed rate of interest and will pay an average variable rate of interest based on three month LIBOR plus 2.1865%. For additional information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 15-Derivatives.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures\nUnder the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have established disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn July 2021, we implemented an enterprise resource planning system covering various financial and accounting processes. As a result of this implementation, certain internal controls over financial reporting have been automated, modified or implemented to address the new environment associated with the implementation of this system. We believe we have maintained appropriate internal control over financial reporting during the implementation and believe this new system will strengthen our internal control system. However, there are inherent risks in implementing any new system, and we will continue to evaluate these control changes as part of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework, management did not identify any material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nGrant Thornton LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2021.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\nFebruary 24, 2022",
