BUSINESS\nBaker Hughes Company (\"Baker Hughes,\" \"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. Built on a century of experience and conducting business in over 120 countries, our innovative technologies and services are taking energy forward.\nOUR VISION & STRATEGY\nWith the breadth of our portfolio, leading technology, and unique partnership models, we are positioned to deliver outcome-based solutions across the energy and industrial markets. By integrating health, safety & environment (\"HSE\") into everything we do, we protect our people, our customers, and the environment.\nThe oil and gas macroeconomic environment continues to be complex. While we believe that the world's reliance on hydrocarbons will not disappear, and oil and gas will continue to remain relevant in meeting global energy demand, we also acknowledge the need to transition to new energy sources. Over the last several years, this transition has been progressing, with governments and society focused on a long-term goal of net-zero emissions while trying to balance the \"energy trilemma\" - energy security, sustainability, and affordability. There is a growing consensus that the energy transition will likely take longer than many expected due to the energy trilemma.\nWe believe the industry is going through a transformation that requires a change in how we work with our existing and new customers expecting new partnerships and commercial models and new technology solutions to deliver sustainable productivity improvements and leverage economies of scale, with a lower carbon footprint. That is why our strategy is focused on improving our core competitiveness and delivering higher-productivity solutions today, while positioning to lead the energy transition and solving the energy trilemma. Our unique portfolio is expected to benefit regardless of how quickly the energy transition develops.\nOur strategy is based on three key pillars:\n\u2022Transform the core: We are transforming our current business to improve margins and cash flow, which we are achieving through portfolio rationalization, cost improvement, and new business models.\n\u2022Invest for growth: We are driving organic and inorganic growth in high potential markets where we have a strong position, including industrial power and processes, industrial asset management, non-metallics, and chemicals.\n\u2022Position for new energy frontiers: We are making strategic investments to drive lower carbon emissions in the energy and industrial sectors, including hydrogen; geothermal; carbon capture, utilization and storage (\"CCUS\"); and clean power solutions.\nWe expect to benefit from our strategy in the following ways:\n\u2022Scope and scale: We have a global presence and a broad, diversified portfolio. Our products, services, and expertise serve the upstream, midstream/liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry, as well as broader chemical and industrial segments. We deliver through our two operating segments: Oilfield Services & Equipment (\"OFSE\") and Industrial & Energy Technology (\"IET\") as discussed below under \"Products and Services,\" and each are among the top providers for the majority of the product lines in the markets they serve.\n\u2022Technology: Our culture is built on a heritage of innovation and invention through research and development, with complementary capabilities. Technology remains a differentiator for us, and a key enabler to drive the efficiency and productivity gains our customers need. We also have a range of technologies that support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. We remain committed to investing in our products and services to maintain our leadership position across our offerings, including $658 million research and development (\"R&D\") spend and being granted more than 2,000 patents worldwide in 2023. We have also made strategic acquisitions to strengthen our core technology portfolio, including Altus Intervention which adds significant well intervention capabilities to our OFSE segment.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 1\n\u2022Energy transition solutions: We are positioned to support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint with a range of emissions-abatement products and services, which we refer to as \"new energy.\" This includes more efficient power generation and compression technology, as well as sensor technology that reduces flaring and overall carbon emissions, technology for CCUS, hydrogen production, transportation, storage and distribution, and geothermal solutions. Over the past several years, we have made progress in strategic investments and acquisitions in emerging energy technologies to advance CCUS, hydrogen, clean power and e-fuels with companies such as Mosaic, Nemesys, HIF Global, and NET Power, among others. We also continue to expand our low to zero-carbon solutions capabilities, helping customers to detect, quantify, and reduce emissions more efficiently and accurately, and complementing our existing solutions available today.\n\u2022Digital capabilities: We expect to benefit from the emerging demand for intelligent operations and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") based solutions as part of our customers' digital transformation initiatives. In 2023, we launched several key digital solutions across our portfolio for existing customers, including Cordant\u2122 for industrial and energy customers and the Leucipa\u2122 automated field production solution for oilfield customers. We also continued our investments in digital partners, including Corva. In addition to enhancing our technology portfolio with new AI applications, we are embedding digital elements in our core OFSE product lines, helping them to deliver efficiency, predictability, and a better experience for our customers and ourselves.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nOur two operating segments are organized based on the nature of our markets and customers and consist of similar products and services and growth profiles. We sell to our customers through direct and indirect channels. Our primary sales channel is through our direct sales force, which has a strong regional focus with local teams close to the customer, who are able to draw support from centers of excellence in each of our major product lines. Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive environment varies by product line. See discussion below by segment.\nOilfield Services & Equipment\nThe OFSE segment designs and manufactures products and provides related services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of an asset, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning.\nBeyond its traditional oilfield concentration, OFSE is also expanding its capabilities and technology portfolio to meet the challenges of the energy transition, including focusing on new energy areas, such as geothermal and CCUS, strengthening its digital architecture, and addressing key energy market themes.\nThe OFSE segment is organized into four product lines.\n\u2022Well Construction focuses on drilling and includes drilling services (directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, surface logging, and remote operations), drill bits (polycrystalline, roller cone, hybrid, and in-bit sensing), and drilling & completion fluids (emulsion-based, water-based, specialty, drill-in, and completion fluids; and waste management).\n\u2022Completions, Intervention, & Measurements encompasses completions (wellbore construction, upper and lower completions, unconventional multistage completions, intelligent production systems, workover systems, and fishing and through-tubing services), pressure pumping (cementing, production enhancement, coiled tubing, and tubular running services), and wireline services (openhole logging services, cased-hole logging services, and perforating and drill stem-testing services).\n\u2022Production Solutions spans artificial lift systems (electrical submersible pumping systems, surface pumping systems, rigless deployment systems, and sensors and gauges) and oilfield & industrial chemicals (upstream, downstream, and AquanessTM wholesale chemicals).\n\u2022Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems includes subsea projects and services (subsea trees, controls, manifolds, wellheads, premium casing connectors, installation and commissioning, repairs and\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 2\nmaintenance, well intervention, life-of-field solutions, and plug and abandonment), flexible pipe systems (subsea risers, subsea flowlines and jumpers, onshore reinforced thermoplastic pipe, and rehabilitation), and surface pressure control systems (surface trees and wellheads).\nThese product lines are supported by an OFSE digital group, which combines the segment's domain expertise with a deep understanding of digital technology to improve operational safety, performance, and sustainability. Reservoir analysis proficiencies are rooted in evaluation technologies, a team of reservoir experts, and software. Together, these capabilities provide customers with a greater understanding of the subsurface, enabling smoother, faster drilling and precise wellbore placement that can lead to improved recovery and project economics. OFSE also provides integrated well services and solutions to plan and execute projects ranging from well construction and production through well abandonment, in addition to integrated services and solutions for the subsea environment.\nOFSE customers include large integrated major and super-major oil and natural gas companies; U.S. and international independent oil and natural gas companies; national or state-owned oil and natural gas companies; engineering, procurement, and construction contractors; geothermal companies; and other oilfield services companies. OFSE believes that its principal competitive differentiators in the industries and markets it serves are the quality, efficiency, reliability, and availability of its products and services. A continued commitment to service delivery, HSE standards, technical proficiency, and competitive pricing is also a key factor in its success.\nOFSE products and services are sold in highly competitive markets. While OFSE may have contracts that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period ranging from two to four years, its services and products are generally provided on a well-by-well basis. Most contracts cover pricing of the products and services, along with various limitations on liability, but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use OFSE products and services. OFSE competitors include SLB and Halliburton (Well Construction; Completions, Intervention, & Measurements; Production Solutions; Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems); ChampionX (Production Solutions); and TechnipFMC, Aker Solutions, and NOV (Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems).\nIndustrial & Energy Technology\nThe IET segment combines a broad array of domain expertise, technologies, software, and services for energy customers including on-and offshore, LNG, pipeline and gas storage, refining, petrochemical, distributed gas, nuclear, hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and storage, clean power and renewables. It also provides cutting edge technology for consumers of energy and/or organizations who are reliant on infrastructure integrity. IET solutions unlock the ability to transform, transfer, and transport energy efficiently, while capturing and cutting emissions, addressing a fundamental challenge behind the energy trilemma: reducing environmental impact, while maximizing efficiency, safety, productivity, reliability and availability.\nEffective October 1, 2023, IET re-aligned its product lines and began operating through five product lines - Gas Technology Equipment, Gas Technology Services, Industrial Products, Industrial Solutions, and Climate Technology Solutions.\n\u2022 Gas Technology Equipment delivers highly efficient mechanical and electric drive compression and power generation technology for projects across the natural gas value chain.

We also conduct business in a number of industrial markets and provide critical equipment hardware capability for full plant offerings, asset performance management and process optimization.\nWe benefit from stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts and master service agreements. Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer's technical specifications with little or no relief available due to changes in circumstances. In some cases, failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims. We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers.\nWe strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices. In connection with oil & gas operations, our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of their employees and often their contractors; the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment, and often that of their contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well control, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and often that of our subcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment; and surface pollution originating from our equipment while under our control. Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices (e.g., in connection with industrial and/or digital sectors), we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence and include an overall limitation of liability clause. It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer contracts.\nOur indemnity structure may not protect us in every case. Certain U.S. states have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract. Applicable law or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct, or in the event of breaches of applicable laws or breach of confidentiality and/or intellectual property rights. We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products. It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always possible. Similarly, government agencies and other third parties may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault. We have an established process to review any risk deviations from our standard contracting practices.\nThe Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable; however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 5\nORDERS AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nRemaining performance obligations, a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), are unfilled customer orders for products and product services excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty, even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience. For product services, an amount is included for the expected life of the contract.\nWe recognized orders of $30.5 billion and $26.8 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. We recognized OFSE orders of $16.3 billion and $14.1 billion, and IET orders of $14.2 billion and $12.7 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining performance obligations totaled $33.5 billion. As of December 31, 2023, OFSE remaining performance obligations totaled $3.5 billion, and IET remaining performance obligations totaled $29.9 billion.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe engage in R&D activities across both operating segments directed toward the development of new products, services, technology, and other solutions, as well as bringing about a significant improvement to existing products and services, and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs. We also continue to invest and develop a range of technologies that support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $658 million of R&D expense.\nIn OFSE, we continue to fund a range of formation evaluation, drilling, completions, and production capabilities and products. In parallel, and in strong collaboration with the IET technology organization, we are investing in strategic themes that fuel our future product and service portfolios. These include themes such as digital, automation, electrification, chemistry and materials, electronics, CCUS, and geothermal.\nSpecifically for OFSE, in our Well Construction product line, we are improving reliability in high-temperature and high shock and vibration environments (harsh-drilling conditions), through a combination of optimized design, automated operations, and integrated solutions that leverage our drilling tools, drill bits, and drilling fluids technologies. In our Completions, Intervention, and Measurements product line, we are investing in intelligent solutions and advanced measurements while creating a leadership position in the well-intervention domain through the integration of our wireline measurement capabilities with the conveyance and intervention capabilities. In our Production Solutions product line, we are leveraging our artificial lift technologies with our chemical solutions to provide an optimized and automated portfolio of production-enhancing solutions. In our Subsea and Surface Pressure Solutions product line, we continue to develop subsea production systems that improve performance and reduce emissions through lighter design, automated operations, and electrification. Our offshore flexible pipe systems optimized for higher pressure temperature and CO2 content continue to deliver greater sustainability and performance.\nIn IET, we continue to invest in and develop foundational technologies which will enable our journey for the energy transition. Such technologies include advanced materials, advanced manufacturing technologies, novel process technologies, and digital technologies such as advanced sensing & diagnostics, data sciences, and artificial intelligence. Within Gas Technology Equipment and Gas Technology Services product lines, we are focusing on our latest generation of gas turbines for energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint such as our LM9000TM and Nova LTTM products, as well as Allam Cycle turboexpander, CCUS, and hydrogen and geothermal technologies. Within Industrial Technology, we are investing in advanced digital solutions designed to improve the efficiency, reliability, and safety of oil and gas, aerospace, energy, and broader industrial production and operations. This includes our Orbit 60 Bently Nevada product for critical asset monitoring in turbine systems, including wind, hydro, and gas turbines. The IET segment is also enhancing its process and safety valve business bringing new digital applications including analytics to our customers. Investments in Industrial Technology also include technologies to measure, monitor, and minimize carbon emissions, new inspection technologies for nondestructive evaluation of materials and structures as well as solutions for industrial asset management.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur technology, brands and other intellectual property (\"IP\") rights are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee invention\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 6\nassignment agreements to protect our IP rights. Many patents and patent applications comprise the Baker Hughes portfolio and are owned by us. Other patents and patent applications applicable to our products and services are licensed to us by General Electric (\"GE\") and, in some cases, third parties. In particular, we have an IP cross-license agreement with GE that allows both parties to have continued and permanent rights to commercially utilize certain IP of the other pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The IP cross-licenses remain in place following GE exiting its ownership position in us. We do not consider any individual patent to be material to our business operations.\nWe follow a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We believe that maintenance, protection and enforcement of our patents, trademarks, and related IP rights is central to the conduct of our business, and aggressively pursue protection of our IP rights against infringement, misappropriation, or other violation worldwide as may be necessary to protect our business. Additionally, we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete.\nSEASONALITY\nOur operations can be affected by seasonal events, which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services, and our customers' budgetary cycles. Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below:\n\u2022In OFSE, adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or extreme heat in the Middle East during the summer months, may impact our operations or our customers' operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and/or damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. For more information on seasonal and weather conditions, see the \"Operational Risks\" section of Part 1 of Item 1A herein.\n\u2022Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea in OFSE generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers' operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.\n\u2022Many of our international OFSE customers may increase activity for certain products and services in the fourth quarter as they seek to fully utilize their annual budgets.\n\u2022Our broader IET businesses typically experience higher customer activity as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year.\nRAW MATERIALS\nWe purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services. The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys, chromium, nickel, titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components, and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks. Raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources but may be subject to price volatility. We have also seen prices remain elevated for ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other raw materials. Our procurement teams utilize advanced planning and may enter into strategic agreements with our global suppliers to minimize price impacts and other availability challenges. We anticipate some pricing and fulfillment volatility for certain raw materials, components, and certain logistics lanes to continue through 2024.\nIn addition to raw materials and component parts, we also use the products and services of metal fabricators, machine shops, foundries, forge shops, assembly operations, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, packagers, indirect material providers, and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers. These materials and services are generally available from multiple sources.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 7\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (\"ESG\")\nEnvironmental\nWe believe we have an important role to play in society as an industry leader and partner. We view ESG as a lever to transform the performance of our Company. In 2019, we made a commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This goal encompasses emissions from our operations (\"Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions\") in alignment with the Paris Agreement and the specific recommendations of the United Nations (\"UN\") Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5oC.\nWe continue to make progress on emissions reductions. We reported in our 2022 Corporate Sustainability Report a 28% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions compared to our 2019 base year. This reduction was primarily due to implementing energy efficiency initiatives, facility consolidation, increasing electric power consumption from renewable energy sources, and improvements in our vehicle fleet, among other reasons. We plan to continue to employ a broad range of emissions reduction initiatives across manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, energy sourcing, and generation. Our latest Corporate Sustainability report is available on the Company section of our website at www.bakerhughes.com. Information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (\"Annual Report\") and should not be considered part of this Annual Report or any other filing we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nOur sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the UN Global Compact (\"UNGC\") and our commitment to the UNGC's Ten Principles including human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, as well as the UNGC's Sustainable Development Goals. We have annually renewed our commitment to the UNGC since joining in 2019.\nSocial & Human Capital\nAt Baker Hughes, our people are central contributors to our purpose of taking energy forward.

Our DEI Knowledge Center, located on the Baker Hughes intranet, enables us to provide our workforce with tools, resources, and learning opportunities that raise awareness, foster inclusive behaviors, and build cross-cultural competences.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe are committed to paying for performance and supporting our employees' wellbeing, as well as the wellbeing of their families, by offering flexible and competitive benefits tailored by location to meet the specific needs of our employees. We regularly assess our total compensation and benefits programs through benchmarking with industry peers and local markets. We strive to ensure that our compensation programs are fair and equitable for all employees. Healthcare plans and life insurance are a core benefit of the Company and are provided in most locations. Baker Hughes offers various leaves of absence options for certain quality-of-life needs, including family care. We also continue to assess and provide programs that support our employees' work arrangements such as flexible schedules, compressed work weeks, hybrid work, remote work, and other options.\nLearning and Development\nLearning and Development is a personal journey at Baker Hughes. We empower our employees to follow their passion for personal knowledge, job related skills, development, and the domain expertise needed for professional and personal growth. In alignment with this, in 2023, we built upon the progress in our social learning communities, by transitioning to an improved learning delivery platform. This change in the learning ecosystem simplified the user experience for our learners and enabled rich analytics for the team to continuously make the learning experience more engaging, impactful, and easy.\nOur learning communities CORE Values, CORE Strengths and JOURNEY continue to provide opportunities for all employees to learn, share and practice their learning with their peers no matter where they are in their career. CORE Values, is a curated learning space centered around our Baker Hughes Values: Grow, Care, Collaborate, and Lead, and the behaviors associated with each. CORE Strengths adds focus to the critical skills (for example Data Analytics, Project Management, Change Management) that will help transform our organization, and JOURNEY is targeted for people leaders to help them transition into their leadership roles. We continue to offer in-person learning opportunities to complement the robust virtual learning catalog with workshops and team development.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 9\nOur formal leadership development programs play a pivotal role in attracting, retaining, and developing talent and increasing the pipeline of diverse talent into and within the organization. As an example, Aspire is a two-year rotational leadership program for recent graduates and early-career employees to grow functional and leadership skills through challenging assignments, learning plans, and global cross-functional projects.\nHealth, Safety, Environment, and Wellness\nHSE is at the core of our culture as we are committed to doing the right thing to protect our employees, customers, the communities where we live and work, and the environment. We take a risk-based approach with proactive and preventive programs to deliver safe, secure, and sustainable operations. We have established a stringent set of standards which meet or exceed global HSE regulatory requirements.\nOur commitment to HSE starts at the highest levels of our Company and is embedded throughout all layers of the organization. We encourage and empower all employees to take an active role in \"owning\" HSE by stopping work when conditions and/or behaviors are unsafe and reporting observations, near misses, and stop-work events through open reporting channels. Our employees are required to complete recurring HSE training. We offer over 200 unique HSE courses including foundational training required for all employees, workplace and job-specific training, and human-performance leadership training for managers. Our ambition is to make every day a \"Perfect HSE Day\"-one without serious injuries, accidents, or harm to the environment. In 2023, we achieved 199 Perfect HSE Days, down 8% versus 2022.\nOur commitment to HSE goes beyond safety alone. Occupational health and wellness is a key competency jointly managed within our HSE and Human Resources (\"HR\") teams. The importance of physical health, ergonomics, preventative health care, and mental wellness cannot be overstated in promoting a healthy, engaged, and productive workplace. We work with our health benefit providers and internal teams to offer employees health and wellness programs, telemedicine access, health screenings, immunizations, fitness reimbursements, and virtual wellness tools.\nIn 2023, the mental health and emotional well-being of our employees continued to be a critical priority. We hosted numerous events with Baker Hughes leaders and external experts, further embedded mental well-being into leadership engagements, and provided resources and tools to employees. Our Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") provides employees and their family members direct access to professional coaches for in-the-moment counseling or referrals to community experts and extended care providers to navigate daily life and cope with major life events.\nCommunity Involvement\nBaker Hughes seeks to make a positive impact in the communities where we conduct business around the world. Consistent with our purpose and values, we work to advance environmental quality, educational opportunities, health, and wellness. We benefit our communities through financial contributions, in-kind donations of goods and services, and volunteer projects. The Baker Hughes Foundation makes strategic philanthropic contributions, matches Baker Hughes employee charitable contributions, and awards volunteer recognition grants for outstanding employee community service.\nGovernance\nThe Board believes the purpose of corporate governance is to maximize shareholder value in a manner consistent with legal requirements and the highest standards of integrity. The Board has adopted and adheres to corporate governance practices, which the Board and management believe promote this purpose, are sound, and represent best practices. The Board periodically reviews these governance practices, Delaware law (the state in which the Company is incorporated), the rules and listing standards of Nasdaq and the SEC regulations, as well as best practices suggested by recognized governance authorities.\nThe Board monitors and provides oversight over our ESG policies, programs, and practices regarding corporate responsibility and sustainability and plays an active role in overseeing our human capital management efforts. Our Human Capital and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our social strategy, policies, programs, and initiatives focusing on DEI as well as pay equity, culture, talent development, succession planning, and executive compensation and benefits. Our Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee provides oversight of the\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 10\nCompany's environmental matters, including monitoring its sustainability strategy and initiatives, the management of employee health, safety, and wellness matters, and oversight of our positions on corporate social responsibilities and public issues of significance which affect investors and other key stakeholders. The Audit Committee provides oversight over the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies and processes, including data privacy, and compliance reporting.\nGOVERNMENTAL REGULATION\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are committed to the health and safety of people, protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws, regulations and our policies. Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations concerning, among other things, air and water quality, waste management, occupational health and safety, and land protection. Environmental regulations continue to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment of new legislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities, obtain new or updated permits to conduct regulated activities, initiate investigatory and/or remedial measures, apply specific HSE criteria addressing employee protection and/or to change or discontinue present methods of operation. Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly.\nOngoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred. Based upon current information, we believe that our overall environmental regulatory compliance obligations, including investigatory and/or remediation obligations, environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost, based on available information, is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWhile we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business, we are, and may in the future be, involved in investigation and/or remediation projects at current and former properties, typically related to historical operations and operations of our predecessor companies. In some cases, our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we have primary responsibility for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, investigation and/or remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. Our total accrual for environmental remediation was $58 million and $63 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which our products are manufactured or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, classification, labeling, safety, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, advertising, and marketing of our products. Additionally, as a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the import and export of goods as well as the flow of funds between us and our subsidiaries. In particular, the shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Pursuant to their laws and regulations, governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. We are also required to be in compliance with transfer pricing, securities laws, and other statutes and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other countries\u2019 anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 11\nAs a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February of 2022, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), European Union (\"EU\"), and other countries enacted sanctions against Russia and certain Russian interests. As previously announced on March 19, 2022, we suspended any new investments in our Russia operations, but continued to comply with applicable laws and regulations as we fulfilled existing contractual obligations. Over the course of the second quarter of 2022, we closely monitored the developments in Ukraine and Russia and changes to sanctions all of which continued to make ongoing operations increasingly complex and significantly more challenging. As a result, we completed a number of actions during the course of 2022 including the sale of part of our OFSE Russia business and suspended substantially all of our remaining operational activities in Russia. In 2023, our focus in Russia has been to continue to close local entities within the scope of western sanctions and local regulation. For further information see \"Note 20. Restructuring, Impairment and Other\" and \"Note 21. Business Dispositions and Acquisitions\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nWe are also subject to laws relating to data privacy and security and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments worldwide have established laws and regulations, and industry groups also have promoted various standards, regarding data privacy and security, including with respect to the protection and processing of personal data. The legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We are also subject to labor and employment laws, including regulations established by the U.S. Department of Labor and other local regulatory agencies, which sets laws governing working conditions, paid leave, workplace safety, wage and hour standards, and hiring and employment practices.\nWhile there are no current environmental or regulatory matters that we expect to be material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flows or have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, there can be no assurances that existing or future environmental laws and other laws, regulations and standards applicable to our operations or products will not lead to such a material adverse impact.\nAVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION FOR STOCKHOLDERS\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Exchange Act\"), are made available free of charge on our internet website at www.bakerhughes.com as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC, and can be found at their internet website www.sec.gov.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves various risks. When considering an investment in the Company, one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below, as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and matters not listed below, that we are unaware of, or that we currently consider immaterial. Any of these may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in the Company.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Our investments in new technologies, equipment, and facilities may not provide competitive returns.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing our products and services and securing equipment across our portfolio. Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. In order to be competitive, we must provide new and differentiating technologies, reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers.\nWe continue to invest in new technologies, equipment, and facilities and to expand our capabilities and technology portfolio to meet the challenges of a net-zero future. These efforts include expanding into new energy areas such as geothermal and carbon capture, utilization and storage, strengthening our digital architecture and addressing key energy market themes. Our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry's capacity relative to customer demand, on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors' products and services and to provide innovative and competitive products and services to meet our client's evolving needs with respect to new energy areas. Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive and innovative technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, or as a result of the energy transition to lower carbon emitting technology, or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services, any competitive advantage that we may hold, and in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have, and may in the future enter into, agreements with third parties to jointly develop certain technologies which may include financial or other commitments. Under the terms of these agreements, we may agree to share in the associated development and marketing costs for the developed technologies. There can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully develop these technologies in collaboration with these third parties that will adequately meet our customers' needs. Also, there can be no assurances that these joint development agreements will be commercially viable, successful or profitable. As a result, these joint development agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe potential transition risks posed by moving to a lower carbon economy could have an adverse effect on the demand for our technologies and services.\nThere is increased focus by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders on a climate change, sustainability, and energy transition matters. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy will likely require extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes.\nThese changes may result in the enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives (at the government, regulator, corporate and/or investor community levels); technological advances with respect to the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy; increased availability of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, energy sources other than oil and natural gas and development of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, lower-emission products and services as well as more efficient products and services.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 14\nOur future success may depend on our ability to effectively execute on our energy transition strategy and the pace at which the energy transition unfolds. Our strategy depends on our ability to develop additional innovative technologies and work with our customers and partners to advance new energy solutions such as geothermal, CCUS, hydrogen energy, and other integrated solutions. If the energy transition occurs faster than anticipated or faster than we can transition, or if we are unable to execute our energy transition strategy as planned, demand for our technologies and services or access to capital could be adversely affected. If the energy transition occurs slower than anticipated, we could be developing technologies and services that are not responsive to the commercial needs of our customers.\nIn addition, negative attitudes toward or perceptions of our industry or fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment have led governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to implement initiatives to conserve energy and promote the use of alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services. In addition, initiatives by investors and financial institutions to limit funding to companies in fossil fuel-related industries may adversely affect our liquidity or access to capital.\nDisruptions in our supply chain, the high cost or unavailability of raw materials, equipment, and supplies essential to our business could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials, component parts and manufacturing capacity, including labor, available to meet our manufacturing plans on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories. Additional disruptions within our supply chain resulting from factors including, but not limited to, pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and shortages in labor supply, have had and may continue to have an impact on our business and reputation. Many of the raw materials essential to our business require the use of rail, storage, and trucking services to transport the materials to our job sites. These services, particularly during times of high demand, may cause delays in the arrival of or otherwise constrain our supply of raw materials. These constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. In addition, price increases imposed by our vendors for raw materials and transportation providers used in our business, and the inability to pass these increases through to our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. As a result of these or any other factors, our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis, including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals, control costs, and avoid shortages or over-supply of raw materials and component parts, could be adversely affected.\nThe partial or complete loss of GE as a supplier, as well as contracts with our aeroderivative joint venture (the \"Aero JV\") with GE may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently have an extensive commercial relationship with GE. Although we have a long-term contractual framework in place with GE, if GE were to discontinue or reduce its business with the Company, fail to perform its obligations under existing contracts, such as our long-term supply agreement for heavy-duty gas turbines, or experience significant disruptions, including under the intellectual property related agreements with GE, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to our contracts and arrangements with GE as a direct supplier, we and GE formed the Aero JV in 2019. The Aero JV is jointly controlled by GE and us, and as a result, realizing the benefits of this joint venture depends on the continued cooperation between the parties. In addition, the business and financial performance of the Aero JV may be adversely affected if GE were to fail to perform its obligations under its contracts with the Aero JV. We in turn use certain products purchased through the Aero JV for the manufacture of various end products, and therefore, failure of the Aero JV to perform for any reason could prevent us from fulfilling our contractual obligations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively and our operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations and future success depend on our ability to recruit, train, and retain key personnel. People are a key resource to developing, manufacturing, and delivering our products and providing technical services and\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 15\nsolutions to our customers around the world. A competent, well-trained, highly skilled, motivated, and diverse workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business. Difficulties in hiring or retaining key employees, or the unexpected loss of experienced employees resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base, could have an adverse impact on our business performance, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, successfully executing organizational change as we restructure the Company, management transitions at leadership levels of the Company, and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include: employee morale, our brand reputation as an employer of choice, competition from other employers, our location strategy for key roles, investments in technology and systems, and availability of qualified individuals with the desired skills and experiences needed to grow our business. Other factors that have, and could continue to impact our workforce, are: changes to our office environments and the impact this could have on our Company culture, the adoption of new work models, and our requirements and/or expectations about when or how often certain employees work on-site or remotely, which may not meet the expectations of our employees.\nThe implementation of our plan to restructure our corporate organization and operating segments may not achieve the results we anticipate, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the second half of 2022, we announced a plan to undertake certain corporate realignments and restructure our four operating segments to focus on two operating segments, OFSE and IET, in order to simplify and streamline our organizational structure, and create better flexibility and economies of scale across the two operating segments. Restructuring activities may be more costly than anticipated, and could lead to the diversion of management's attention from other business priorities. As a result of these or any other factors, we may not realize the anticipated benefits associated with the restructuring plan. There can be no assurance that the restructuring plan will result in cost savings or will materially increase our profitability. Even if the restructuring plan generates the benefits that we have anticipated, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that occur as a result of the restructuring, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be impacted by both geopolitical and terrorism threats, including armed conflict, in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest and/or government expropriations.\nGeopolitical and terrorism threats continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business. Geopolitical and terrorism threats, including armed conflict among countries, has had and could in the future lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, adverse impact to our employees, and impairment of our or our customers' ability to conduct operations.\nFurther, the broader consequences of geopolitical and terrorism threats, which may include further sanctions that prohibit our ability to do business in specific countries, embargoes, supply chain disruptions, the potential inability to service our remaining performance obligations and potential contractual breaches and litigation, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, and the extent of any such threats effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\nCertain geopolitical conflicts, such as between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, have had and may continue to have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in our public filings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on regional and global macroeconomic conditions; increased volatility in the price and demand of oil and natural gas, increased exposure to cyber attacks; limitations in our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; risks to employees and contractors that we have in the region; disruptions in global supply chains; exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; potential nationalizations and assets seizures; constraints or disruption in the capital markets and our sources of liquidity; our potential inability to service our remaining performance obligations and potential contractual breaches and litigation. Any such risks may require us to record asset impairments and experience adverse operating impacts which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 16\nControl of oil and natural gas reserves by national oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.\nMuch of the world's oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by national oil companies. National oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with national oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.\nOur operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses.\nThe products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex, and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers' costs. In addition, many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries, such as the offshore oilfield business. These hazards include blowouts, explosions, unplanned or uncontrolled releases, nuclear-related events, fires, collisions, capsizings, and severe weather conditions. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards. Our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event, against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe potential physical risks posed by climate change could adversely affect our operations and those of our customers.\nThe physical risks of climate change can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency and severity of significant weather events (e.g. flooding, hurricanes and tropical storms), natural hazards (e.g., increased wildfire risk), rising mean temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns (e.g. drought, desertification, or poor water quality). Such effects have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results, particularly at facilities in coastal areas or areas prone to chronic water scarcity, and could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers, including through direct damage to physical assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. While we evaluate and incorporate potential ranges of physical risks, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also \"Seasonal and weather conditions, including severe weather associated with climate change, could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.\"\nSeasonal and weather conditions, including severe weather associated with climate change, could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or extreme winter conditions in Canada or the North Sea, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers' operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Repercussions of severe or unseasonable weather conditions, including as a result of climate change, may include evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services, weather-related damage to offshore drilling rigs resulting in suspension of operations, weather-related damage to our facilities and project work sites, inability to deliver materials to job sites in accordance with contract schedules, decreases in demand for oil and natural gas during unseasonably warm winters, and loss of productivity. As a result of the above repercussions or any others, demand for our services and operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business has and may continue to be adversely affected by a public health emergency or outbreak of a contagious disease or virus.\nIn the past, the markets have experienced volatility in oil demand due to the economic impacts of public health emergencies. If demand for our products and services decline as a result of a public health emergency, the utilization of our assets and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services could\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 17\ndecline. The spread of a pandemic could result in instability in the markets and decreases in commodity prices resulting in adverse impacts on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases and measures to contain the disease may adversely impact our workforce and operations, operations of our customers, and those of our vendors and suppliers. The extent to which these public health emergencies adversely impact our business would depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending on the severity and duration of the emergency and effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. There is considerable uncertainty regarding such containment or mitigation measures and potential future measures which may result in labor disruptions, employee attrition, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCREDIT AND CUSTOMER CONTRACTING RISKS\nProviding services on an integrated, turnkey, or fixed price basis could require us to assume additional risks.\nWe may choose to enter into integrated or turnkey contracts with our customers that require us to provide services and equipment outside of our core business. Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may also subject us to additional risks, such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling operations, project management interface risk, and risks associated with subcontracting and consortium arrangements. These integrated or turnkey contracts may be fixed price contracts that do not allow us to recover for cost over-runs unless they are directly caused by the customer.\nWe may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements.\nOur products are used in deepwater, and other harsh environments, and severe service applications. Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services, which may also include extensive testing requirements. In addition, scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry and LNG industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications. We cannot provide assurance that our products, including products supplied through joint ventures, will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the full-scale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts, or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects, which could impose additional costs and obligations on us.\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects. Under such arrangements, each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work, and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed. The failure or inability, financially or otherwise, of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us. These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project, liquidated damages or contract disputes.\nOur contracts may be terminated early in certain circumstances.\nOur contracts with customers generally may be terminated by the customer for convenience, default, or extended force majeure (which could include inability to perform due to a pandemic or as a result of civil unrest or armed conflicts). Termination for convenience may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer, but the early termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Termination by the customer for default or extended force majeure due to events outside of our control generally will not require the customer to pay an early termination fee.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 18\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our customers terminate some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, if payments due under our contracts are suspended for an extended period of time, or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated. Our remaining performance obligation (\"RPO\") is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services). The actual amount and timing of revenues earned may be substantially different than the reported RPO. The total dollar amount of the Company's RPO as of December 31, 2023 was $33.5 billion.\nThe credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses.\nHaving a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers. Furthermore, countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices, which could affect our ability to collect, timely or at all, from our customers in these countries, particularly national oil companies. Laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers, we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less, or none, of the amounts owed to us by such customer.\nOur customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets.\nOur customers' access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices, required investments, and resulting returns. Limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow. In addition, a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for credit losses.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nCompliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results. In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.\nWe conduct business in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. In particular, goods, services, data, finances, and technology that cross international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Pursuant to their laws and regulations, governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions.\nCompliance-related issues could limit our ability to do business in certain countries, impact our earnings, bring reputational harm, or result in governmental investigations leading to fines, penalties or other remedial measures. Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations, and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate. In addition, changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws, rules, and regulations that affect our operations. Government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. The continued\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 19\nsuccess of our global business and operations depends, in part, on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political, legal and regulatory risks. Given the highly dynamic nature of these restrictions and the unprecedented nature of these changes in the last two years, and the uncertainty in the political landscape and unrest in certain areas of the world, our future success depends on the ability of our organization to react to such changes rapidly and appropriately to assure compliance as we continue to conduct business globally.\nOur failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nOur ability to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to successfully manage our agents, distributors and other business partners, and supervise, train, and retain competent employees. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, fines and penalties, as well as legal expenses and reputational harm in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees.\nAnti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have adverse consequences for us.\nNon-compliance with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism financing and various other financial laws may subject us to sanctions, civil and criminal prosecution, fines and penalties, as well as legal expenses and potential reputational harm. While we strive to continuously improve our programs and pursue effective compliance, we cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations.\nChanges in tax laws, tax rates, tariffs, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities, and tax audits in the countries where we operate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to changes in tax laws, rates, treaties, regulations, and tariffs in the various jurisdictions where we operate, any of which, including in the interpretation there of, could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and results of operations. Further, the examinations and subsequent tax assessments by various tax authorities could increase the Company's tax liabilities. Any changes to tax laws or rates or unfavorable positions taken by tax authorities have and could preclude our ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits which could increase the amount of valuation allowances required against deferred tax assets and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could be subject to litigation and environmental claims arising out of our products and services which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks and we are from time to time subject to litigation in the U.S. and in foreign countries, for example claims involving services or equipment such as personal injury or loss of life, product failure (including as a result of a cyber attack) or damage to or destruction of property, employment and labor, customer privacy, or regulatory risks. While we have insurance coverage against operating hazards to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, our insurance may not cover all expenses related to litigation claims arising from our business. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. We may therefore incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated its intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis. Regardless of the merits, any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 20\nparticular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance with, and rulings and litigation in connection with, environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our operations may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe and our business are subject to extensive domestic and international environmental, health and safety regulations. In addition to environmental, health and safety regulatory compliance obligations, we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury, property damage, and human health risks due to exposure to hazardous substances or processes at our current or former facilities. Additionally, we may be impacted by material changes in environmental, health and safety regulations or subject to substantial liability for environmental impacts caused by our (or our predecessors') operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and associated expenditures, including but not limited to our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, are forecasted and may be inconsistent based on multiple variables. Our compliance cost forecasts may be substantially different from actual results, which may be affected by factors such as: changes in law that impose new or increased restrictions on air or other emissions, wastewater management, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing, or wetland and land use practices; changes in standards of enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations; a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected, adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\"), (including Superfund sites, the allocation of PRP liability at other sites, or discovery of additional issues at existing sites) where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations; and the accidental, unauthorized discharge of hazardous materials.\nInvestor and public perception related to the Company's ESG performance as well as current and future ESG reporting requirements may affect our business and our operating results.\nIn recent years, companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from a variety of stakeholders, including investor advocacy groups, proxy advisory firms, certain institutional investors and lenders, investment funds and other influential investors and rating agencies, related to their ESG and sustainability practices. If we do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards on ESG matters (or meet sustainability goals and targets that we have set), as they continue to evolve, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately or quickly enough to growing concern for ESG and sustainability issues, regardless of whether there is a regulatory or legal requirement to do so, we may face increased litigation risk, reputational damage and our business, financial condition and/or stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our continuing efforts to research, establish, accomplish and accurately report on the implementation of our ESG strategy, including our emissions reduction commitments, may also create additional operational risks and expenses and expose us to reputational, legal and other risks. While we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, some of the statements in those voluntary disclosures may be based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters.\nOur voluntary disclosures of ESG data are evaluated and rated by various organizations that assess corporate ESG performance. These organizations provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters and have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Unfavorable ESG ratings, or our inability to meet the ESG standards set by specific investors, may lead to negative investor sentiment and reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact, among other things, on our stock price and cost of capital.\nRegulatory requirements related to ESG or sustainability reporting have been adopted and may continue to be introduced in various jurisdictions. For example, the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive became effective in 2023 and applies to both EU and certain non-EU entities. In October 2023, California enacted the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate Related Financial Risk Act that will require large public and private companies that do business within the state to disclose their Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions, with third party assurance of GHG emissions information for certain entities, and issue public\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 21\nreports on their climate-related financial risk and related mitigation measures. In 2023, California also enacted the Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosures Act, which requires companies that operate within the state and make certain climate-related claims to provide enhanced disclosures around the achievement of such claims. We expect regulatory disclosure requirements related to ESG matters to continue to expand globally, which has and may continue to increase our cost and burden of compliance and subject us to increased legal and reputational risk.\nTo achieve our stated emission reduction goals, we have implemented internal decarbonization projects and may also need to rely on external factors, such as the greater deployment of carbon reduction and removal technologies and adoption of government policies that we expect would accelerate the adoption of energy transition technologies. There have been policy responses to support the energy transition in the U.S. with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition, geopolitical instability has increased energy prices compared to the prior year and raised energy security concerns, which may result in many governments reassessing energy transition strategies, extending the timeline to ensure adequate and reasonably priced energy supplies. It is difficult to predict with certainty how these policy, economic, and energy security issues will impact the energy transition. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our reductions and elimination of carbon equivalent emissions commitments within the timelines we announce, or changes to these commitments or related timelines could have a negative impact on investor sentiment, ratings outcomes for evaluating our approach to ESG matters, our stock price and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation, among other material adverse impacts.\nInternational, national, and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on reducing GHG emissions. Compliance with GHG emission regulations applicable to our or our customers' operations may have significant implications that could adversely affect our business and operating results in the fossil-fuel sectors.\nIn the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. The EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among others, certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry and the EPA has recently proposed to expand the scope of the rule, which in turn may impact (and include) data from our equipment or operations. In addition, the U.S. government has proposed rules in the past setting GHG emission standards for, or otherwise aimed at reducing GHG emissions from, the oil and natural gas and power industries. International developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol by the signatories; the Glasgow Climate Pact; the EU Emission Trading System; Article 8 of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive and the United Kingdom's Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting framework; and the EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism. Caps or fees on carbon emissions, including in the U.S. (such as proposed methane fees under the Inflation Reduction Act), have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossil-fuel sectors. The implementation of these agreements and other existing or future regulatory mandates, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, require us or our customers to reduce GHG emissions or impose taxes on us or our customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nVoluntary initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, as well as increased climate change awareness, may result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas.\nThere are various corporate and non-governmental initiatives that are focused on voluntary reductions of GHG emissions. These developments, and public perception relating to climate change, may shift demand from oil and natural gas towards an investment in relatively lower carbon emitting energy sources and alternative energy solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws or regulations, or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy or security, may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe have access to sensitive, confidential, proprietary or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is or may become subject to various data privacy and security laws, regulations, standards,\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 22\ncontractual obligations or customer-imposed controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations are and may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn the U.S., various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws, regulations and standards concerning personal information, privacy and data security. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. Internationally, laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information or other data. For example, the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals located in the European Economic Area and the U.K. is subject to strict regulations, and compliance may require adhering to stringent legal and operational obligations and the dedication of substantial time and financial resources.\nThe various and evolving federal, state and international laws, regulations and standards can differ significantly from one another and, given our global footprint, this may significantly complicate our compliance efforts and impose considerable costs, such as costs related to organizational changes and implementing additional protection technologies, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, compliance with applicable requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or international laws, regulations, standards, or contractual or other obligations, relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies, customers or individuals, which could subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties or judgments, all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nTECHNOLOGY RISKS\nAn inability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate. Our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. The weakening of protection of our trademarks, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business.\nWe are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business. Our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized. Without protection for the intellectual property rights we own or license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products. Also, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future, and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms. We would be adversely affected in the event that any such license agreement was terminated without the right for us to continue using the licensed intellectual property.\nIncreased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents, pose risks to our systems, data and business, and our relationships with customers and other third parties.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we may hold or have access to sensitive, confidential, proprietary or personal data or information belonging to us, our employees or third parties, including customers, partners or\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 23\nsuppliers. Increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents, pose risks to our and our customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' systems, data, and business, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our and our employees' and customers' data. We utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate our exposure including maintaining a dedicated Cyber Fusion Center and engaging third party experts. For more information see the \"Risk Management & Strategy\" section of Part 1 of Item 1C herein. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, we remain vulnerable to cyber attacks and other security incidents, including ransomware incidents. Given our global footprint, the large number of customers, partners, suppliers and service providers with which we do business, and the increasing sophistication and complexity of cyber attacks, an incident could occur and persist for an extended period without detection. Any investigation of a cyber attack or other security incident would be inherently unpredictable and it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an incident. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to, and recover from any cyber attacks and other security incidents. As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to our own systems, we use third-party service providers, who in turn may also use third-party providers, to process certain data or information on our behalf. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cybersecurity incidents attributed to our service providers to the extent affecting information we share with them. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and maintain reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems.\nDespite our and our service providers' efforts to protect our data and information, we and our service providers have been and may in the future be vulnerable to security breaches, ransomware attacks, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, employee errors and/or malfeasance or similar events, including those perpetrated by criminals or nation-state actors, that could potentially lead to the compromise, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of data or information, improper use of our systems, defective products, loss of access to our data, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber attack or any other significant compromise or breach of our data security, media reports about such an incident, whether accurate or not, or, under certain circumstances, our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, law enforcement agencies or affected individuals following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols, could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, harm to our relationships with customers, partners, suppliers and other third parties, distraction to our management, remediation or increased protection costs, significant litigation or regulatory action, fines and penalties. Given the increased prevalence of customer-imposed cybersecurity controls and other related contractual obligations towards customers or other third parties, a cyber attack or other security incident also could result in breach of contract or indemnity claims against us by customers or other counterparties.\nWhile we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to cybersecurity breaches or attacks, failures or other data security-related incidents, and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that an insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 24\nINDUSTRY AND MARKET RISKS\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nPrices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis. As a result, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels.\nDemand for our products and services is subject to factors beyond our control and depends substantially on expenditures by our customers. Changes in the global economy could impact our customers' spending levels and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth and substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. Across our products and services, customer demand may be reduced due to global economic factors beyond our control, including but not limited to inflation, rising interest rates, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and declining availability of credit. Specifically, for example, past oil and natural gas industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield products and services and lower expenditures by our customers, which in the past has resulted, and may in the future result, in a prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices that may require us to record asset impairments, and we could experience decreased revenue, decreased profitability and reduction in cash flows. Such potential impairment charges and adverse operating metrics could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSupply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nProductive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers' decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells.\nCurrency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results.\nFluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business and create volatility, as well as the costs of doing business of our customers.\nChanges in economic and/or market conditions may impact our ability to borrow and/or cost of borrowing.\nThe condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general may affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing, if necessary. Actions by the Federal Reserve in the last year to increase interest rates, and the potential for further increases or an extended period of elevated interest rates, has resulted, and could continue to result, in increased borrowing costs or make the cost of borrowing funds commercially unattractive. Furthermore, if our credit rating is downgraded, it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and issuances of commercial paper, as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining, or make it more difficult to renew, obtain, or issue new debt financing.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly, our shareholders may be unable to sell their shares of our Class A common stock at or above their purchase price, if at all. We cannot assure our shareholders that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock or result in\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 25\nfluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock include: variations in our quarterly operating results; failure to meet our earnings estimates; publication of research reports about us or our industry; additions or departures of our executive officers and other key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; actions by shareholders; changes in market valuations of similar companies; speculation in the press or investment community; changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; adverse publicity about our industry generally or individual scandals, specifically; and general market and economic conditions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that might be considered favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable by permitting the Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock, requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations, and placing limitations on convening shareholder meetings. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals, delay, or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. The forum selection clause in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nThis exclusive forum provision applies to certain state law claims and will not apply to claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. In addition, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.",

CYBERSECURITY\nRISK MANAGEMENT & STRATEGY\nOverall Process\nWe protect our digital systems and data through a comprehensive cybersecurity management program, which includes a dedicated cybersecurity function, risk assessments, policies and procedures, and technical measures and related services from third party service providers. We have a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\") with overall responsibility for the cybersecurity program, including threat detection and response, vulnerability management, governance, risk and compliance, security strategy and architecture, security engineering and operations, product and operational technology security. As part of our cybersecurity management program, we operate a Cyber Fusion Center (\"CFC\") to monitor both internal and external cybersecurity threats, conduct initial assessment of severity, coordinate incident response resources, reduce incident response time, and\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 26\nshift toward a proactive cyber-defense model, which includes a dedicated threat intelligence program that leverages custom intelligence platforms as well as industry specific professional associations and ongoing threat hunting. Through our cybersecurity risk management program, we monitor cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors and evaluate the potential operational and financial effects of any threat and countermeasures made to defend against such threats.\nWe have established policies and procedures, including our Incident Response Plan (\"IRP\"), for assessing, identifying, managing, and responding to cybersecurity and privacy threats and incidents, including protocols for assessing potential material impact from cybersecurity threats and incidents, escalating to executive leadership and the Board, engaging external stakeholders, and reporting incidents based on applicable legal requirements. Our IRP provides guidance in the event of a cybersecurity incident, including processes with assigned roles and responsibilities to triage, assess severity, escalate, contain, investigate, and remediate incidents, as well as to comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand and reputational damage. We conduct regular cybersecurity tabletop exercises to test established policies and procedures for responding to cybersecurity threats and incidents. In addition, employees and stakeholders can report cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents, or other concerns through external and internal reporting channels.\nEnterprise Risk Management Process Integration\nCybersecurity risk management processes are an integral part of our enterprise risk management, which is overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board. Our processes include periodic program maturity assessments, ongoing information technology risk assessments, and third-party security risks assessments.\nOur cybersecurity risk management efforts have also been integrated into the overall Enterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\") process, which includes assessment of cybersecurity risks that could result in significant operational disruption to the Company, such as production disruption, business downtime, loss of containment or other operation interruptions, as well as risks that could have significant reputational and compliance/regulatory impact. Cybersecurity risks identified and tracked through our ERM risk register have assigned risk owners at the executive leadership level and risk delegates who are responsible to identify and manage risk mitigation actions. Key risk indicators are updated quarterly by risk delegates and communicated to our executive leadership and the Audit Committee.\nWe leverage recognized cybersecurity frameworks to drive strategic direction and maturity improvement and engage third party security experts for risk assessments, risk mitigation actions, and program enhancements. We also include cybersecurity training as part of our required annual employee training program. In addition, cybersecurity and privacy training and awareness is integrated and continues throughout the year, utilizing various delivery methods such as phishing campaigns, training sessions, and informational articles.\nThird Party Security Experts\nWe engage third party security experts to supplement our internal CFC team as well as for assessments, penetration tests and program enhancements, including vulnerability assessments, security framework maturity assessments and identification of areas for continued focus and improvement. In addition, our third-party experts work with us to conduct cybersecurity tabletop exercises and internal phishing awareness campaigns. We use the findings of these exercises to improve our practices, procedures, and technologies. We also engage third party security experts to support our cybersecurity threat and incident response management and maintain information security risk insurance coverage.\nIdentification of Threats Associated with Third Parties\nBaker Hughes utilizes a third-party risk management (\"TPRM\") program to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with third-party relationships, including cybersecurity risks. We conduct initial risk assessments of third-party suppliers and service providers based on various factors to classify each into a risk category. Our TPRM program is designed to apply our most rigorous processes to those suppliers and service providers that are classified into the highest risk category. These processes include due diligence assessments of third-party suppliers and service providers that have access to Baker Hughes networks, confidential information, and information systems in order to assess the risks from cybersecurity threats that could impact our suppliers and third-party service providers. We leverage external partners to assist with the regular assessment of our top priority\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 27\nsuppliers and third-party service providers to identify, review and address risks, including deeper reviews of their cybersecurity controls. We track the identified deficiencies and include with other cybersecurity metrics based on their severity. We also require that our suppliers and third-party service providers have in place appropriate technical and organizational security measures and security-control principles based on recognized cybersecurity standards.\nIncidents & Risks\nWe have not experienced a material cybersecurity incident and although we are subject to ongoing and evolving cybersecurity threats, we are not aware of any material risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For more information on our cybersecurity risks, see \"Technology Risks\" identified in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Part 1 of Item 1A herein.\nGOVERNANCE\nBoard of Directors\nOversight responsibilities for our cybersecurity and digital trust compliance programs and risks lie with the Audit Committee of the Board. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of our cybersecurity program and oversees all operational, financial, strategic, and reputational risks with oversight of specific risks undertaken with the committee structure including risks related to cybersecurity, privacy, and technology.\nThe Audit Committee receives reports on the Company's cybersecurity program and developments from our Chief Information Officer (\"CIO\"), who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, and our CISO, who reports to the CIO, at each of our regular meetings, which occur five times a year. These reports typically include analyses of recent cybersecurity threats and incidents at the Company and across the industry, as well as a review of our own security controls, assessments and program maturity, and risk mitigation status, as well as a review of our third-party service providers. Our digital technology, legal, and the corporate audit functions also routinely present to the Audit Committee on key cybersecurity topics and, on at least an annual basis, the Board receives reports on the Company's cybersecurity program and developments from the CIO and CISO.\nManagement\nOur programs are focused on building digital trust through sound oversight of cybersecurity and data privacy protections and the responsible use of data and technology. We operate a CFC, and we have a cross-functional approach to addressing cybersecurity-related risks through the functional compliance structures in our digital technology and legal organizations with oversight from the corporate audit and controllership functions. The cybersecurity and legal functions employ full time cybersecurity and privacy roles with expertise in managing cybersecurity and privacy compliance and risks and responding to incidents.\nOur senior executive leadership is actively engaged in the oversight and strategic direction of our cybersecurity and digital trust compliance programs. The senior executive leadership-level Cybersecurity Steering Committee (\"CSC\") is responsible for assessing cybersecurity risks, providing direction and oversight for risk mitigation action, and assisting the Audit Committee in overseeing the Company\u2019s cybersecurity risks. The CSC also receives monthly reports on the Company's cybersecurity program and developments from our CISO and legal representatives. The CSC is chaired by our CISO. The senior executive leadership members include the CIO, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, and Senior Vice President of Operations Excellence.\nThe CISO has over 25 years of business experience in information technology and cybersecurity and is a long-standing certified information systems security professional (\"CISSP\") with the International Information System Security Certification Consortium.\nWe have an Incident Response Team (\"IRT\") that consists primarily of representatives from the CFC, legal, corporate communications, finance, and other relevant stakeholders. The IRT follows the guidance as outlined in the IRP to respond to cybersecurity incidents and escalate as necessary to the CSC based on a defined severity matrix. Internal legal and finance stakeholders are responsible for assessing materiality of risks in consultation with the IRT, CSC, the CEO, and external advisors.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 28",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nFor management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 please refer to Part II, Item 7. \"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on February 14, 2023.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our two business segments: OFSE and IET. We sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments, as well as broader industrial and new energy markets.\nDuring 2023, Baker Hughes built strong momentum across the Company with significant improvement in our financial results over 2022. In OFSE, we saw key commercial successes and solid margin improvements, and in IET, we benefited from robust growth in LNG orders, driving RPO to levels that provides meaningful revenue visibility. Overall, we capitalized on market tailwinds to deliver strong revenue growth across both segments, began realizing the full benefits of our cost-out initiatives, and continued to transform how we operate. We also achieved significant growth in new energy orders compared to 2022 as we continue to experience growing demand for decarbonization solutions across the Company's IET and OFSE portfolios.\nAs we look to 2024, we remain balanced on the oil and gas outlook but continue to see areas of strength across our portfolio despite persisting economic uncertainty. We continue to believe in a multiyear upstream spending cycle, which, we believe, will be more durable and less sensitive to commodity price swings relative to prior cycles and led by international and offshore markets. Continued discipline from the world's largest producers and the pace of oil demand growth in the face of economic uncertainty, will remain important factors to monitor as we look into 2024. Oil and gas prices have experienced volatility in the fourth quarter of 2023 and beginning of 2024, and this will likely have some influence on upstream development plans, particularly for shorter-cycle spending budgets.\nAdditionally, the conflict in the Middle East has added another element of uncertainty across the oil and gas markets. While this conflict has not had a material impact on our operations, a further escalation in geopolitical tensions across the region could impact the Company. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the conflict in the Middle East on our business. Furthermore, in IET, the aeroderivative supply chain continues to show signs of tightness, which we will continue to manage operationally.\nWe also remain optimistic on the LNG outlook, seeing a continued shift towards the development of natural gas and LNG. As a result, the LNG project pipeline remains strong, both in the U.S. and internationally. As the world increasingly recognizes the crucial role natural gas is expected to play in the energy transition, serving as both a transition and destination fuel, we believe it will be fundamental in satisfying the world's energy needs for many decades to come.\nFinancial Results\nIn 2023, the Company generated revenue of $25.5 billion, compared to $21.2 billion in 2022, increasing $4.4 billion or 21%. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher volume in IET on Gas Technology Equipment project backlog execution and stronger activity in OFSE. Income before tax was $2,655 million in 2023 compared to $22 million in 2022, increasing $2,633 million. The increase in income before tax was driven by higher volume and price in both segments and structural cost-out initiatives, positive effect from the change in fair value on certain equity securities, and lower restructuring and impairment charges.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 32\nOur journey of transformation continues. The business has undertaken significant structural changes, and we see the cost-out performance coming through our operating results. We have made significant progress; however, there is still more work to do to further identify areas to simplify and create efficiencies and modernize how the business operates, including actions launched in OFSE to remove duplication and further streamline the business.\nBaker Hughes remains committed to a flexible capital allocation policy that balances returning cash to shareholders and investing in growth opportunities. We increased our quarterly dividend in the third quarter of 2023 by one cent to $0.20 per share. For the full year of 2023, we returned a total of $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest in the Baker Hughes portfolio through strategic acquisitions. In 2023, we completed the acquisition of Altus Intervention, a leading international provider of well intervention services and downhole technology, which significantly enhances OFSE's existing portfolio. We also completed the sale of the Nexus Controls business in April 2023.\nOutlook\nOur business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to changing conditions in the industry.\n\u2022OFSE North America activity: After trending lower most of 2023 due to lower activity from private exploration & production operators and in gas basins, North American activity has recently stabilized. However, we see a slow start to 2024 and anticipate only a modest recovery in activity during the second half of 2024.\n\u2022OFSE International activity: We expect spending outside of North America to experience moderate growth in 2024, as compared to 2023.\n\u2022IET LNG projects: We remain optimistic on the LNG market long-term and view natural gas as a transition and destination fuel. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive.\nWe have other businesses in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including global GDP growth. We also have businesses within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions of the energy and broader industry, including hydrogen, geothermal, CCUS, energy storage, clean power and emissions abatement solutions. We expect to see continued growth in these businesses as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix.\nOverall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the oil and gas industry, but we are continuing to operate with flexibility. Over time, we believe the world's demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world's energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, low-emission, and cost-effective solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company.\nOur revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations, and their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 33\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\n2023 2022\nBrent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)\n$ 82.49 $ 100.93\nWTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)\n77.58 94.90\nNatural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)\n2.53 6.45\n(1)Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\") Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\n(2)EIA Cushing, OK West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") spot price\n(3)EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\nOutside North America, customer spending is influenced by Brent oil prices. The average Brent oil prices decreased to $82.49/Bbl in 2023 from $100.93/Bbl in 2022 and ranged from a low of $71.03/Bbl in March 2023, to a high of $97.10/Bbl in September 2023.\nIn North America, customer spending is influenced by WTI oil prices, which similarly to Brent oil prices, on average decreased to $77.58/Bbl in 2023 from $94.90/Bbl in 2022, and ranged from a low of $66.61/Bbl in March 2023, to a high of $93.67/Bbl in September 2023.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $2.53/mmBtu in 2023, representing a 61% decrease over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $3.78/mmBtu in January 2023, to a low of $1.74/mmBtu in June 2023. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, working natural gas in storage at the end of 2023 was 3,476 billion cubic feet (\"Bcf\"), which was 20%, or 585 Bcf, below the corresponding week in 2022.\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 34\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\n2023 2022\nNorth America 864 898\nInternational 948 851\nWorldwide 1,812 1,749\n2023 Compared to 2022\nThe worldwide rig count was 1,812 in 2023, an increase of 4% as compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase in activity internationally partially offset by a decline in North America. The rig count in North America decreased 4% and the international rig count increased 11% in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWithin North America, the decrease was primarily driven by the U.S. rig count, which was down 5% on average when compared to the same period last year, partially offset by an increase in the Canada rig count, which was up 1% on average. Internationally, the increase in the rig count was driven by increases in the Africa, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Latin America regions of 24%, 22%, 11%, 8%, and 6%, respectively.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nOur results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of our operating segments is primarily evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, inventory impairments, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company primarily uses the following:\nVolume: Volume is defined as the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. Volume also includes price, which is defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (\"FX\"): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation and benefits, and overhead costs.\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume and price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 35\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations\nOur consolidated statements of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which \"goods\" is required to include all sales of tangible products and \"services\" must include all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between \"equipment\" and \"product services,\" where product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to \"product services\" simply as \"services\" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOrders: We recognized orders of $30.5 billion and $26.8 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. We recognized OFSE orders of $16.3 billion and $14.1 billion, and IET orders of $14.2 billion and $12.7 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Within IET, Gas Technology orders were $10.4 billion and $9.2 billion, Industrial Technology orders were $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, and CTS orders were $0.6 billion and $0.4 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. References to total new energy orders incorporates CTS in IET of $0.6 billion and OFSE of $0.2 billion.\nRemaining Performance Obligations (\"RPO\"): As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $33.5 billion. As of December 31, 2023, OFSE remaining performance obligations totaled $3.5 billion, and IET remaining performance obligations totaled $29.9 billion.\nRevenue and Operating Income\nSummarized financial information for the Company's segments is shown in the following tables.\nYear Ended December 31, $ Change\n2023 2022 From 2022 to 2023\nRevenue:\nWell Construction $ 4,387 $ 3,854 $ 533\nCompletions, Intervention & Measurements 4,170 3,559 611\nProduction Solutions 3,854 3,587 267\nSubsea & Surface Pressure Systems 2,950 2,230 720\nOilfield Services & Equipment 15,361 13,229 2,131\nGas Technology Equipment\n4,232 2,599 1,633\nGas Technology Services\n2,600 2,440 160\nTotal Gas Technology 6,832 5,039 1,793\nIndustrial Products\n1,962 1,697 265\nIndustrial Solutions\n983 884 99\nControls (1)\n41 208 (167)\nTotal Industrial Technology 2,987 2,789 198\nClimate Technology Solutions\n326 98 228\nIndustrial & Energy Technology 10,145 7,926 2,219\nTotal $ 25,506 $ 21,156 $ 4,350\n(1)The sale of our controls business was completed in April 2023.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 36\nThe following table presents Oilfield Services & Equipment revenue by geographic region:\nYear Ended December 31, $ Change\n2023 2022 From 2022 to 2023\nNorth America $ 4,116 $ 3,764 $ 352\nLatin America 2,761 2,099 662\nEurope/CIS/Sub-Saharan Africa (1)\n2,655 2,483 172\nMiddle East/Asia 5,829 4,883 946\nOilfield Services & Equipment $ 15,361 $ 13,229 $ 2,131\nNorth America $ 4,116 $ 3,764 $ 352\nInternational 11,245 9,465 1,779\n(1)Impacted by the discontinuation of our Russia operations that occurred in 2022.\nThe following table presents segment operating income through to net income (loss) for the Company.\nYear Ended December 31, $ Change\n2023 2022 From 2022 to 2023\nSegment operating income:\nOilfield Services & Equipment $ 1,746 $ 1,201 $ 546\nIndustrial & Energy Technology 1,310 1,135 175\nTotal segment operating income 3,055 2,336 719\nCorporate (380) (416) 36\nInventory impairment (1)\n(35) (31) (4)\nRestructuring, impairment and other (323) (705) 382\nOperating income 2,317 1,185 1,133\nOther non-operating income (loss), net 554 (911) 1,464\nInterest expense, net (216) (252) 36\nIncome before income taxes 2,655 22 2,633\nProvision for income taxes (685) (600) (85)\nNet income (loss) $ 1,970 $ (578) $ 2,547\n(1)Charges for inventory impairments are reported in \"Cost of goods sold\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nFiscal Year 2023 to Fiscal Year 2022\nRevenue increased $4,350 million, or 21%, driven by increased activity across both segments. OFSE increased $2,131 million and IET increased $2,219 million. Total segment operating income increased $719 million, primarily driven by OFSE and to a lesser extent IET.\nOilfield Services & Equipment\nOFSE revenue of $15,361 million increased $2,131 million, or 16%, in 2023 compared to 2022, as a result of increased activity as evidenced by an increase in the global rig count. International revenue was $11,245 million in 2023, an increase of $1,779 million from 2022, primarily driven by the Middle East/Asia and Latin America regions, partially offset by lower volume due to the discontinuation of our Russia operations that occurred in 2022. North America revenue was $4,116 million in 2023, an increase of $352 million from 2022.\nOFSE segment operating income was $1,746 million in 2023 compared to $1,201 million in 2022. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher volume, price and cost-out initiatives, partially offset by inflationary pressure and lower cost productivity.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 37\nIndustrial & Energy Technology\nIET revenue of $10,145 million increased $2,219 million, or 28%, in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume in Gas Technology Equipment and, to a lesser extent, in CTS, Industrial Technology and Gas Technology Services.\nIET segment operating income was $1,310 million in 2023 compared to $1,135 million in 2022. The operating income performance in 2023 was driven by higher volume, price and cost-out initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable business mix and cost productivity, inflationary pressure, and higher research and development costs related to new energy investments.\nCorporate\nIn 2023, corporate expenses were $380 million compared to $416 million in 2022. The decrease of $36 million was driven by savings related to our corporate optimization process.\nInventory Impairment\nIn 2023, we recorded inventory impairments of $35 million, predominately in the OFSE segment related to exit activities at specific locations. In 2022, we recorded inventory impairments of $31 million, primarily in the IET segment as part of suspending our Russia operations. Charges for inventory impairments are reported in \"Cost of goods sold\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2023, we recognized $323 million of restructuring, impairment, and other charges. We continued to incur charges in 2023 related to our plan initiated in 2022 that consisted primarily of employee termination expenses driven by actions taken to facilitate our reorganization into two segments and to optimize our corporate structure. Restructuring charges for 2023 also include costs related to exit activities at specific locations in our segments to align with the current market outlook and to rationalize our manufacturing supply chain footprint. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred additional costs related to a planned workforce reduction, primarily in OFSE.\nIn 2022, we recognized $705 million of restructuring, impairment, and other charges primarily related to the suspension of substantially all of our operations in Russia, and the impairment of certain long-lived assets in the OFSE segment for the subsea production systems business due to a decrease in the estimated future cash flows driven by a decline in our long-term market outlook for this business.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Loss), Net\nIn 2023, we incurred $554 million of other non-operating income. Included in this amount was a gain of $555 million from the change in fair value for certain equity investments.\nIn 2022, we incurred $911 million of other non-operating losses primarily due to the loss of $451 million from the sale of part of the OFSE business in Russia and a loss of $265 million from the change in fair value for certain equity investments. Additionally, in December 2022, the Company, Baker Hughes Holdings, LLC (\"BHH LLC\") and GE entered into an agreement which resulted in the termination of the Tax Matters Agreement (\"TMA\"), and as a result, we incurred a charge of $81 million, of which $21 million was a cash payment to GE as a net settlement of claims asserted under the TMA. The TMA governed the administration and allocation between the parties of tax liabilities and benefits arising prior to, as a result of, and subsequent to the merger in 2017, including the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the parties with respect to various other tax matters.\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2023, we incurred net interest expense of $216 million, which includes interest income of $84 million. Net interest expense decreased $36 million compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher interest income.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 38\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2023, the provision for income taxes was $685 million. The difference between the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate is primarily related to income in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than in the U.S. and losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances, partially offset by income subject to U.S. tax at an effective rate less than 21% due to valuation allowances.\nIn 2022, the provision for income taxes was $600 million. The difference between the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate is primarily related to losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances, restructuring charges for which a majority has no tax benefit, and earnings in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than in the U.S.\nIn 2021, as part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (\"OECD\") Inclusive Framework, 140 member countries agreed to the implementation of the Pillar Two Global Minimum Tax (\"Pillar Two\") of 15%. The OECD continues to release additional guidance, including administrative guidance on how Pillar Two rules should be interpreted and applied by jurisdictions as they adopt Pillar Two. A number of countries have utilized the administrative guidance as a starting point for legislation that is effective January 1, 2024. Baker Hughes is continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of Pillar Two, pending legislative adoption by individual countries.\nCOMPLIANCE\nIn the conduct of all of our activities, we are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical, and quality standards as also reported in our Quality Management System. We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. We devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program (\"Compliance Program\") which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond to any potential violations of the law, the Code of Conduct, and other Company policies and procedures.\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\n\u2022Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations to government officials and other parties; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, there are policies and procedures to address customs requirements, visa processing risks, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-boycott laws.\n\u2022Global and independent structure of Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance professionals providing compliance advice, customized training and governance, as well as investigating allegations across all regions and countries where we do business.\n\u2022Comprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis.\n\u2022Due diligence and monitoring procedures for third parties who conduct business on our behalf, including channel partners (sales representatives, distributors, resellers), and administrative service providers.\n\u2022Due diligence procedures for acquisition activities.\n\u2022Specifically tailored compliance risk assessments and audits focused on country and third party risk.\n\u2022Compliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as segment compliance review boards that meet quarterly.\n\u2022Technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a conflict of interest reporting and management system, a web-based anti-boycott reporting tool, global trade management systems and comprehensive watch list screening.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 39\n\u2022Data privacy compliance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable data privacy requirements.\n\u2022A compliance program designed to create an \"Open Reporting Environment\" where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in approximately 200 languages.\n\u2022Centralized finance organization with company-wide policies.\n\u2022Anti-corruption audits of high-risk countries, as well as risk-based compliance audits of third parties.\n\u2022We have region-specific processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion into select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire training module which includes compliance training for all employees.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources, and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. We continue to maintain solid financial strength and liquidity. At December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.6 billion compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2022.\nIn the U.S. we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and outside the U.S. of approximately $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held outside the U.S. at December 31, 2023 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate certain cash to the U.S., we may incur other additional taxes that would not be significant to the total tax provision.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $637 million and $605 million, respectively, of cash held in countries with currency controls that limit the flow of cash out of the jurisdiction or limit our ability to transfer funds without potentially incurring substantial costs. These funds are available to fund operations and growth in their respective jurisdictions, and we do not currently anticipate a need to transfer these funds to the U.S.\nIn November 2023, BHH LLC entered into a $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (\"the New Credit Agreement\") with commercial banks maturing in November 2028. The New Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, certain affirmative covenants and negative covenants, in each case we consider customary. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the New Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the New Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. The New Credit Agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Baker Hughes. In addition, we have authorization to issue up to $3 billion of commercial paper. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no borrowings under the New Credit Agreement and no outstanding commercial paper.\nCertain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. See \"Note 9. Debt\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further details. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Our next debt maturity is June 2024.\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by geopolitical events, a global pandemic or a significant decline in oil and gas prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility; however, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 40\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, the payment of dividends, repayment of long-term debt, and repurchases of our common stock.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n(In millions) 2023 2022\nOperating activities $ 3,062 $ 1,888\nInvesting activities (817) (1,564)\nFinancing activities (2,028) (1,592)\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities generated cash of $3,062 million and $1,888 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and others for a wide range of goods and services.\nIn 2023, cash generated from operating activities were primarily driven by net income adjusted for certain noncash items (including depreciation, amortization, gain on equity securities, stock-based compensation cost, deferred tax benefit, and the impairment of certain assets). Net working capital cash generation was $42 million mainly due to strong progress collections on equipment contracts, mostly offset by an increase in receivables and inventory as we continue to build for growth. Included in our 2023 cash flows from operating activities are payments of $142 million made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities.\nIn 2022, cash generated from operating activities were primarily driven by net losses adjusted for certain noncash items (including depreciation, amortization, loss on business dispositions, stock-based compensation cost, deferred tax provision, loss on equity securities, and the impairment of certain assets). Working capital, which includes contract and other deferred assets, generated cash of $122 million in 2022 mainly due to strong progress collections on equipment contracts and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by the increase in receivables and inventory as we build for revenue growth.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $817 million and $1,564 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures including property, plant and equipment (\"PP&E\") and software, to support and generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets were $1,224 million and $989 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the disposal of PP&E of $208 million and $217 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets are primarily related to equipment that was lost-in-hole, predominantly in OFSE, and PP&E no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period.\nWe had proceeds from the sale of certain equity securities of $372 million and $26 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, in 2023, we completed the acquisition of businesses for total cash consideration of $301 million, net of cash acquired, which consisted primarily of the acquisition of Altus Intervention in the OFSE segment. We also completed the sale of businesses and received total cash consideration of $293 million, which consisted primarily of the sale of our Nexus Controls business in the IET segment.\nThe Central Bank of Argentina maintains currency controls that limit our ability to access U.S. dollars and remit cash from our Argentine operations. There is an indirect foreign exchange mechanism known as a Blue Chip Swap\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 41\nthat enables companies to transfer U.S. dollars out of and into Argentina, effectively at a parallel U.S. dollar exchange rate. In 2023, we entered into transactions in order to remit cash from our Argentine operations resulting in a net loss and a net cash outflow of $66 million, which is included in other investing activities.\nIn 2022, we completed the acquisition of businesses for total cash consideration of $767 million, net of cash acquired, including BRUSH Power Generation, Quest Integrity, AccessESP, and Mosaic Materials.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities used cash of $2,028 million and $1,592 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn 2023, we repaid long-term debt of $651 million primarily related to certain senior notes that matured in December. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend by one cent to $0.20 per share during the third quarter of 2023. We paid dividends of $786 million and $726 million to our Class A stockholders, and we made distributions of nil and $17 million to GE in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn 2023, we repurchased and canceled 16.3 million shares of Class A common stock for a total of $538 million. In 2022, we repurchased and canceled 29.7 million shares of Class A common stock for a total of $828 million.\nCash Requirements\nWe believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility, access to both commercial paper and our uncommitted lines of credit, and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity in the short-term and long-term to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, repay debt, repurchase our common stock, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. Based on current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2024 will be made at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $800 million to $850 million in 2024.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur material cash commitments from known contractual and other obligations consist primarily of obligations for long-term debt and related interest, leases for property and equipment, and purchase obligations as part of normal operations. Certain amounts included in our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors.\nSee \"Note 9. Debt\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our long-term debt. See \"Note 8. Leases\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our operating leases.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had expected cash payments for estimated interest on our long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $253 million payable within the next twelve months and $2,687 million payable thereafter.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had purchase obligations of $1,871 million payable within the next twelve months and $875 million payable thereafter. Our purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2024 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services or licenses that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 42\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $629 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations discussed above. See \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity\nRegistration Statement: In December 2023, Baker Hughes, together with BHH LLC and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. filed a universal automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, purchase contracts and units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold will be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in December 2026.\nCustomer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results of operations. As of December 31, 2023, 19% of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the U.S. and 11% were from customers in Mexico. As of December 31, 2022, 15% of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the U.S. and 11% were from customers in Mexico. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our gross customer receivables at this date.\nInternational operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S. is 75% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2023. Depending on the jurisdiction or country where this cash is held, we may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nGuarantor Information\nBaker Hughes has senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured debentures (collectively the \"Debt Securities\") outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $5,908 million as of December 31, 2023, with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2047. The Debt Securities constitute debt obligations of BHH LLC, an indirect, 100% owned subsidiary and the primary operating company of Baker Hughes, and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc, a 100%-owned finance subsidiary of BHH LLC (the \"Issuers\") that was incorporated for the sole purpose of serving as a corporate co-obligor of debt securities. The Debt Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Baker Hughes and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other senior and unsecured debt obligations.\nAs permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded summarized financial information for the Issuers because the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Issuers are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in Baker Hughes Company's consolidated financial statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to a material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our consolidated financial statements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, or the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 43\nAccounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment, but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers within our IET segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of greater than 10 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an over time basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods.\nRevisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $15 million, $20 million and $14 million for the three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.6 billion and $0.7 billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 11% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs.\nRevenue Recognition on Sale of Customized Equipment\nWe recognize revenue on agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications including long-term construction projects, on an over time basis utilizing cost inputs as the measurement criteria in assessing the progress toward completion. Our estimation of the total costs required to fulfill our promise to a customer is generally based on our history of manufacturing similar assets for customers. This estimation of cost is critical to our revenue recognition process and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or cost of the inputs. In certain projects, the underlying technology or promise to the customer is unique to what we have historically promised and reliably estimating the total cost to fulfill the promise to the customer requires a significant level of judgment. We provide for potential losses on any of these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss. The total revenue recognized for the sale of equipment on an over time basis during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $6.1 billion, $4.2 billion, and $4.8 billion, respectively.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 44\nGoodwill and Other Long-lived Assets\nWe perform an annual impairment test of goodwill for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual impairment test, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the existence of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if we conclude otherwise, we would be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information, such as trading multiples, and comparable transactions.\nOther long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. When testing for impairment, we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, which involves significant estimates and judgments on the part of management.\nThe determination of whether goodwill and other long-lived assets are impaired involves a significant level of judgment and estimation, and changes in our forecasts, business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions, among other things, could significantly impact these judgments, potentially decreasing the fair value of one or more reporting units or long-lived assets. Any resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and differences between tax laws and U.S. GAAP in various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our rate may be further impacted by the repatriation of foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested to the extent the repatriation would result in additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management\u2019s judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. When evaluating the recoverability of these deferred tax assets, all positive and negative evidence is analyzed including existing cumulative earnings or loss, forecasted taxable income from the reversal of taxable temporary differences, future forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. The sources of this evidence rely heavily on estimates. Hence, we use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide additional insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Further, a change to realizability of our deferred tax assets is recognized in the Company's tax provision in the period in which the change occurs.\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $467 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2023. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 45\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due to us. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for credit losses totaled $350 million and $341 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the anticipated credit losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit losses that may be required.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nSee \"Note 1.

    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk, but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. A discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 46\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nAll of our long-term debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments. We are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, we had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $500 million that converted a portion of our $1,350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.337% fixed rate Senior Notes due 2027 into a floating rate instrument with an interest rate based on a LIBOR index as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk. As of July 1, 2023, the interest rate changed to be based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate index. The interest rate swaps are designated and each qualify as a fair value hedging instrument. The interest rate swaps are considered to be effective at achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged liability, and no ineffectiveness is recognized. The mark-to-market of this fair value hedge was recorded as a gain or loss in interest expense and was equally offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also was recorded in interest expense.\nThe following table sets forth our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.\n(In millions) 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total (2)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLong-term debt (1)\n$ 107 $ - $ 600 $ 1,350 $ - $ 3,756 $ 5,813\nWeighted average interest rates\n4.08 % - % 2.35 % 5.29 % - % 4.06 % 4.16 %\n(1)Fair market value of our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was $5.5 billion at December 31, 2023.\n(2)Amounts represent the principal value of our long-term debt outstanding and related weighted average interest rates at the end of the respective period.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK\nWe conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies, and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency. As such, future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies.\nAdditionally, we buy, manufacture and sell components and products across global markets. These activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses. When the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates, it will affect the revenue earned on the sale. These sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates. Changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing. We use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures, where appropriate.\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts. We had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $3.6 billion and $3 billion to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The notional amounts of these derivative instruments do not generally represent cash amounts exchanged by us and the counterparties, but rather the nominal amount upon which changes in the value of the derivatives are measured.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company estimates that a 1% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar would result in an impact of less than $10 million to our pre-tax earnings; however, the Company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure, where there are liquid financial markets, through use of foreign currency derivative transactions. Also, see \"Note 15. Financial Instruments\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which has additional details on our strategy.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 47",
    "item_8": "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. This conclusion is based on the recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal control. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nKPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n/s/ LORENZO SIMONELLI\nLorenzo Simonelli\nChairman, President and\nChief Executive Officer\n/s/ NANCY BUESE\nNancy Buese\nChief Financial Officer\n/s/ REBECCA CHARLTON\nRebecca Charlton\nSenior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 5, 2024\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 48\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nBaker Hughes Company:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Baker Hughes Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 5, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue recognition on certain agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications on an over time basis. Revenue from these types of contracts is recognized to the extent of progress towards completion measured by actual costs incurred relative to total expected costs. The Company provides for potential losses on these types of contracts when it is probable that a loss will be incurred.\nWe identified revenue recognition for certain contracts from the sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company's long-term estimates of the expected costs to be incurred in order to complete these contracts.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 49\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's revenue recognition process for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications. This included controls pertaining to the Company's estimation of costs expected to be incurred to complete contracts for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications. We evaluated the Company's ability to accurately estimate costs expected to be incurred to complete the contracts for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications. We evaluated the estimated costs expected to be incurred to complete the equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications for the contracts by:\n-questioning the Company's finance and project managers regarding progress to date based on the latest project reports and the costs expected to be incurred until completion;\n-observing project review meetings performed by the Company or inspecting relevant minutes of those meetings to identify changes in the estimated costs expected to be incurred to complete the contract and related contract margins;\n-assessing the remaining estimated costs expected to be incurred by expenditure category by comparing to the actual costs incurred during the current year for the selected project; and\n-investigating changes to the contract margin when compared to the prior year's estimated contract margin.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 5, 2024\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 50\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nBaker Hughes Company:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Baker Hughes Company and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 5, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 5, 2024\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 51\nBAKER HUGHES COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS)\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021\nRevenue:\nSales of goods $ 15,617 $ 12,236 $ 12,248\nSales of services 9,889 8,920 8,254\nTotal revenue 25,506 21,156 20,502\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of goods sold 13,309 10,445 10,458\nCost of services sold 6,946 6,311 5,995\nSelling, general and administrative 2,611 2,510 2,470\nRestructuring, impairment and other 323 705 269\nTotal costs and expenses 23,189 19,971 19,192\nOperating income 2,317 1,185 1,310\nOther non-operating income (loss), net 554 (911) (583)\nInterest expense, net (216) (252) (299)\nIncome before income taxes 2,655 22 428\nProvision for income taxes (685) (600) (758)\nNet income (loss) 1,970 (578) (330)\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 27 23 (111)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Baker Hughes Company $ 1,943 $ (601) $ (219)\nPer share amounts:\nBasic income (loss) per Class A common share\n$ 1.93 $ (0.61) $ (0.27)\nDiluted income (loss) per Class A common share $ 1.91 $ (0.61) $ (0.27)\nCash dividend per Class A common share $ 0.78 $ 0.73 $ 0.72\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 52\nBAKER HUGHES COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income (loss) $ 1,970 $ (578) $ (330)\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 27 23 (111)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Baker Hughes Company 1,943 (601) (219)\nOther comprehensive income (loss):\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n153 (269) (305)\nCash flow hedges\n3 2 (16)\nBenefit plans\n19 (14) 170\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 175 (281) (151)\nLess: Other comprehensive loss attributable to noncontrolling interests -

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\nBaker Hughes Company (\"Baker Hughes,\" \"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S.\" and such principles, \"U.S. GAAP\") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") for annual financial information. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Baker Hughes and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates which it controls or variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nIn the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes, certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. In the notes to the consolidated financial statements, all dollar and share amounts in tabulations are in millions of dollars and shares, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Certain columns and rows in our financial statements and notes thereto may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets or liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty, and accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following: allowance for credit losses and inventory valuation reserves; recoverability of long-lived assets; revenue recognition on long-term contracts; valuation of goodwill; useful lives used in depreciation and amortization; income taxes and related valuation allowances; accruals for contingencies; actuarial assumptions to determine costs and liabilities related to employee benefit plans; stock-based compensation expense; valuation of derivatives; and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions.\nForeign Currency\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated into U.S. dollars using our period end exchange rates, and revenue, expenses, and cash flows have been translated at average rates for the respective periods. Any resulting translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income (loss). The impact of remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or its subsidiaries is included in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nRevenue from Sale of Equipment\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time\nWe recognize revenue on agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications including long-term construction projects, on an over time basis, utilizing cost inputs as the measurement criteria in\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 57\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nassessing the progress toward completion. Our estimate of costs to be incurred to fulfill our promise to a customer is based on our history of manufacturing similar assets for customers and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or pricing of the inputs. We begin to recognize revenue on these contracts when the contract specific inventory becomes customized for a customer, which is reflective of our initial transfer of control of the incurred costs. We provide for potential losses on any of these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.\nOur billing terms for these over time contracts vary, but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point In Time\nWe recognize revenue for non-customized equipment at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good. Equipment for which we recognize revenue at a point in time includes equipment we manufacture on a standardized basis for sale to the market. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics associated with the shipment, whereas the delivery of other equipment is generally determined based on historical data of transit times between regions.\nOn occasion we sell equipment with a right of return. We use our accumulated experience to estimate and provide for such returns when we record the sale. In situations where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment and that acceptance has or is likely to occur.\nOur billing terms for these point in time equipment contracts vary, but are generally based on shipment of the equipment to the customer.\nRevenue from Sale of Services\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time\nWe sell product services under long-term product maintenance or extended warranty agreements in our Industrial & Energy Technology segment. These agreements require us to maintain the customers' assets over the service agreement contract terms, which generally range from 10 to 20 years. In general, these are contractual arrangements to provide services, repairs, and maintenance of a covered unit (gas turbines for mechanical drive or power generation, primarily on liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") applications). These services are performed at various times during the life of the contract, thus the costs of performing services are incurred on an other than straight-line basis. We recognize related sales based on the extent of our progress toward completion measured by actual costs incurred in relation to total expected costs. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on any of these agreements when that loss becomes probable. The Company utilizes historical customer data, prior product performance data, statistical analysis, third-party data, and internal management estimates to calculate contract-specific margins. In certain contracts, the total transaction price is variable based on customer utilization, which is excluded from the contract margin until the period that the customer has utilized to appropriately reflect the revenue activity in the period earned. In addition, revenue for certain oilfield services is recognized on an over time basis as performed.\nOur billing terms for these contracts are generally based on asset utilization (i.e. usage per hour) or the occurrence of a major maintenance event within the contract. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point In Time\nWe sell certain tangible products, largely spare equipment, through our services business. We recognize revenue for this equipment at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is at the point in time we deliver the spare part to the customer. Our billing terms for these point in time service contracts vary, but are generally based on shipment of the equipment to the customer.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 58\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and relate to the research and development of new products and services. These costs amounted to $658 million, $556 million and $492 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and development expenses were reported in \"Cost of goods sold\" and \"Cost of services sold\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nShort-term investments with original maturities of three months or less are included in cash equivalents unless designated as available-for-sale and classified as investment securities.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability of the related financial assets is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nOur current receivables are spread over a broad and diverse group of customers across many countries. We grant credit to our customers and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers' financial conditions, including monitoring our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to manage this risk. We do not generally require collateral in support of our current receivables, but we may require payment in advance or security in the form of a letter of credit or a bank guarantee.\nInventories\nAll inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable values and they are measured on a first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") basis or average cost basis. As necessary, we record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment (\"PP&E\") is initially stated at cost and is depreciated over its estimated economic life. Subsequently, PP&E is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is generally provided by using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the individual assets, and impairment losses. We manufacture a substantial portion of our tools and equipment in our OFSE segment and the cost of these items, which includes direct and indirect manufacturing costs, is capitalized in inventory and subsequently moved to PP&E.\nOther Intangible Assets\nWe amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. The cost of intangible assets is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated economic life. Finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In these circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and written down to fair value as required. Refer to the Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets accounting policy.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 59\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets\nWe perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of July 1, in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill. However, if the assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value, which is generally calculated using a combination of market, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow approaches. Potential impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, (i) the results of our most recent annual or interim impairment testing, in particular the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed, (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts, and the magnitude thereof, if any, and (iii) declines in our market capitalization below our book value, and the magnitude and duration of those declines, if any.\nWe review PP&E, intangible assets and certain other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. When testing for impairment, we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash and equivalents, current receivables, investments, accounts payables, short and long-term debt, and derivative financial instruments.\nWe monitor our exposure to various business risks including commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, and we regularly use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. At the inception of a new derivative, we designate the derivative as a hedge, or we determine the derivative to be undesignated as a hedging instrument. We document the relationships between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. We assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item at both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.\nWe record all derivatives as of the end of our reporting period in our consolidated statements of financial position at fair value. For the forward contracts held as undesignated hedging instruments, we record the changes in fair value in our consolidated statements of income (loss) along with the change in the fair value, related to foreign exchange movements, of the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nFair Value Measurements\nFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 60\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nObservable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. Preference is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\n\u2022Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n\u2022Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\n\u2022Level 3 - Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\nWe maintain policies and procedures to value instruments using the best and most relevant data available. In addition, we perform reviews to assess the reasonableness of the valuations. With regard to Level 3 valuations (including instruments valued by third parties), we perform a variety of procedures to assess the reasonableness of the valuations. Such reviews include an evaluation of instruments whose fair value change exceeds predefined thresholds (and/or does not change) and consider the current interest rate, currency and credit environment, as well as other published data, such as rating agency market reports and current appraisals.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nDerivatives\nWhen we have Level 1 derivatives, which are traded either on exchanges or liquid markets, we use closing prices for valuation. The majority of our derivatives are valued using internal models and are included in Level 2. These internal models maximize the use of market observable inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent foreign currency and commodity forward contracts for the Company.\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\nWhen available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment securities, and they are included in Level 1. Level 1 securities primarily include publicly traded equity securities.\nFor investment securities for which market prices are observable for identical or similar investment securities but not readily accessible for each of those investments individually (that is, it is difficult to obtain pricing information for each individual investment security at the measurement date), we use pricing models and observable inputs that are consistent with what other market participants would use and these are included in Level 2. The inputs and assumptions to the models are derived from market observable sources including: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market-related data. When we use valuations that are based on significant unobservable inputs, we classify the investment securities in Level 3.\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. These assets can include long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, equity securities without readily determinable fair value, equity method investments and long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired, and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity.\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nInvestments in equity securities (in which we do not have a controlling financial interest or significant influence, most often because we hold a voting interest of 0% to 20%) with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes recognized in earnings and reported in \"Other non-operating income (loss), net\" in the\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 61\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nconsolidated statements of income (loss). Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar equity securities of the same issuer. These changes are recorded in \"Other non-operating income (loss), net\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nEquity method investments are equity holdings in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence, most often because we hold a voting interest of 20% to 50%. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate carrying amount of our equity method investments was $979 million and $919 million, respectively. The results of our equity method investments are presented in the consolidated statements of income (loss) as follows: (i) if the investment is integral to our operations, their results are included in \"Selling, general and administrative,\" and (ii) if the investment is not integral to our operations, their results are included in \"Other non-operating income (loss), net.\" Investments in, and advances to, equity method investments are presented on a one-line basis in \"All other assets\" in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file U.S. federal and state income tax returns which primarily includes our distributive share of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction of Baker Hughes Holdings LLC (\"BHH LLC\"), our primary operating company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company since December 2022, which was treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes until December 30, 2023. Effective December 30, 2023, the Company and various subsidiaries completed a reorganization that resulted in BHH LLC no longer being treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. As a partnership, BHH LLC was not subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws. However, as of December 31, 2023, BHH LLC will be included and taxed as part of the Company's consolidated U.S. tax return. Non-U.S. current and deferred income taxes owed by the subsidiaries of BHH LLC are reflected in the Company's financial statements.\nWe account for taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and the tax base of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered, as well as for net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes is not more likely than not to be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Our tax filings are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts that we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. We recognize uncertain tax positions that are \"more likely than not\" to be sustained if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. For those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% chance of being realized in a final settlement with the relevant authority. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in the financial statements in the period they are finalized.\nSupply Chain Finance Programs\nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs and requires certain disclosures for a buyer in a supplier finance program.\nUnder the supply chain finance (\"SCF\") programs, administered by a third party, our suppliers are given the opportunity to sell receivables from us to participating financial institutions at their sole discretion at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers. Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 62\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nto a financial institution. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $332 million and $275 million of SCF program liabilities are recorded in \"Accounts payable\" in the consolidated statements of financial position, respectively, and reflected in net cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows when settled.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"), which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 provide for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company prospectively to all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-07\"), which enhances the disclosures required for operating segments in the Company's annual and interim consolidated financial statements. ASU 2023-07 is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our disclosures.\nAll other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued, but not yet effective are currently being evaluated and at this time are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nNOTE 2. CURRENT RECEIVABLES\nCurrent receivables consist of the following at December 31:\n2023 2022\nCustomer receivables $ 6,033 $ 5,083\nOther 1,392 1,216\nTotal current receivables 7,425 6,299\nLess: Allowance for credit losses (350) (341)\nTotal current receivables, net $ 7,075 $ 5,958\nCustomer receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount. The \"Other\" category consists primarily of advance payments to suppliers, indirect taxes, and customer retentions.\nNOTE 3. INVENTORIES\nInventories, net of reserves of $389 million and $396 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, consist of the following at December 31:\n2023 2022\nFinished goods $ 2,626 $ 2,419\nWork in process and raw materials 2,468 2,168\nTotal inventories, net $ 5,094 $ 4,587\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded inventory impairments of $35 million primarily in our Oilfield Services & Equipment segment (\"OFSE\"). For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded inventory\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 63\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nimpairments of $31 million, primarily in our Industrial & Energy Technology (\"IET\") segment.

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, these adjustments resulted in a net increase to the carrying value of our debt totaling $95 million and $91 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of total debt at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $5,571 million and $5,863 million, respectively. For a majority of our debt the fair value was determined using quoted period-end market prices. Where market prices are not available, we estimate fair values based on valuation methodologies using current market interest rate data adjusted for our non-performance risk.\nMaturities of debt for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2028, and in the aggregate thereafter, are listed in the table below:\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter\nTotal debt\n$ 148 $ 4 $ 614 $ 1,308 $ - $ 3,946\nIn November 2023, BHH LLC entered into a $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (\"the New Credit Agreement\") with commercial banks maturing in November 2028. The New Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, certain affirmative covenants and negative covenants, in each case we consider customary. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the New Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the New Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. The New Credit Agreement is\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 68\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nfully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Baker Hughes. In addition, we have authorization to issue up to $3 billion of commercial paper. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no borrowings under the New Credit Agreement and no outstanding commercial paper.\nBaker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. is a co-obligor, jointly and severally with BHH LLC on our long-term debt securities. This co-obligor is a 100%-owned finance subsidiary of BHH LLC that was incorporated for the sole purpose of serving as a corporate co-obligor of long-term debt securities and has no assets or operations other than those related to its sole purpose. As of December 31, 2023, Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. is a co-obligor of our long-term debt securities totaling $5,908 million.\nCertain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions, including, but not limited to, the creation of certain liens securing debt, the entry into certain sale-leaseback transactions, and engaging in certain merger, consolidation and asset sale transactions in excess of specified limits. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nNOTE 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nDEFINED BENEFIT PLANS\nWe maintain Company sponsored pension plans for certain of our employees. We also maintain unfunded end-of-service benefit plans that are mandated in certain countries in which we operate. Our primary plans disclosed in 2023 included four U.S. plans and eight non-U.S. plans, primarily in the United Kingdom and Germany, all with plan assets or obligations greater than $20 million. These defined benefit plans generally provide benefits to employees based on formulas recognizing length of service and earnings; however, the majority of these plans are either frozen or closed to new entrants. We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits, through unfunded plans, to a closed group of U.S. employees who retire and meet certain age and service requirements. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to these plans was $33 million and $37 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFunded Status\nThe funded status position represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the plan assets. Our primary plans consist of seven funded plans and five unfunded plans. The projected benefit obligation (\"PBO\") for pension benefits represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee services and compensation and includes an assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation (\"ABO\") is the actuarial present value of pension benefits attributed to employee service to date at present compensation levels. The ABO differs from the PBO in that the ABO does not include any assumptions about future compensation levels.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 69\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nBelow is the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets and the funded status of our defined benefit plans (\"Pension Benefits\").\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022\nChange in benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year $ 2,634 $ 3,550\nService cost 15 23\nInterest cost 116 78\nActuarial gain (1)\n(4) (928)\nBenefits paid (126) (119)\nSettlements (4) (24)\nSettlement due to plan termination (2)\n(246) -\nAcquisition - 202\nForeign currency translation adjustments 58 (148)\nBenefit obligation at end of year 2,443 2,634\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year 2,266 3,147\nActual return on plan assets 121 (850)\nEmployer contributions 18 32\nBenefits paid (126) (119)\nSettlements (4) (24)\nSettlement due to plan termination (2)\n(246) -\nAcquisition - 214\nForeign currency translation adjustments 51 (134)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year 2,080 2,266\nFunded status - underfunded at end of year $ (363) $ (368)\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 2,399 $ 2,595\n(1)The actuarial gain in 2022 was primarily related to a change in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for our plans.\n(2)Plan termination relates to the termination of one of our fully funded frozen U.S. defined benefit plans that was initiated in April 2022.\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position consist of the following at December 31:\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022\nNoncurrent assets $ 78 $ 58\nCurrent liabilities (17) (15)\nNoncurrent liabilities (424) (411)\nNet amount recognized $ (363) $ (368)\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 70\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInformation for the plans with ABOs and PBOs in excess of plan assets consist of the following at December 31:\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022\nProjected benefit obligation $ 1,410 $ 1,143\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 1,366 $ 1,103\nFair value of plan assets $ 968 $ 717\nWe have a U.S. non-qualified supplemental pension plan (\"BH SPP\") for certain employees which is included in the benefit obligations and funded status in the tables above. In order to meet a portion of our obligations of the BH SPP, we established a trust comprised primarily of mutual fund assets. The value of these assets was $36 million and $34 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These assets are not included as plan assets or in the funded status amounts in the tables above and below.\nNet Periodic Cost\nThe components of net periodic cost consist of the following:\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022 2021\nService cost $ 15 $ 23 $ 27\nInterest cost 116 78 64\nExpected return on plan assets (102) (114) (130)\nAmortization of prior service credit\n1 1 1\nAmortization of net actuarial loss 19 27 40\nCurtailment / settlement loss (16) 2 2\nNet periodic cost $ 33 $ 17 $ 4\nThe service cost component of the net periodic cost is included in \"Operating income (loss)\" and all other components are included in \"Other non-operating income (loss), net\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nAssumptions Used in Benefit Calculations\nAccounting requirements necessitate the use of assumptions to reflect the uncertainties and the length of time over which the pension obligations will be paid. The actual amount of future benefit payments will depend upon when participants retire, the amount of their benefit at retirement and how long they live. To reflect the obligation in today's dollars, we discount the future payments using a rate that matches the time frame over which the payments are expected to be made. We also need to assume a long-term rate of return that will be earned on investments used to fund these payments.\nAnother assumption used is the interest crediting rate for our U.S. qualified cash balance plan. Under the provisions of this pension plan, a hypothetical cash balance account has been established for each participant. Such accounts receive quarterly interest credits based on a prescribed formula.\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for these plans are as follows:\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022\nDiscount rate 4.54 % 4.89 %\nRate of compensation increase 3.26 % 3.30 %\nInterest crediting rate 3.98 % 4.31 %\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 71\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost for these plans are as follows:\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022 2021\nDiscount rate 4.89 % 2.15 % 1.66 %\nExpected long-term return on plan assets\n5.05 % 3.85 % 4.07 %\nInterest crediting rate 4.31 % 2.60 % 2.60 %\nWe determine the discount rate using a bond matching model, whereby the weighted average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities have maturities consistent with the timing of benefit payments. Lower discount rates increase the size of the benefit obligations while higher discount rates reduce the size of the benefit obligation. The compensation assumption is used in our active plans to estimate the annual rate at which the pay for plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase.\nThe expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the pension obligations. To determine this rate, we consider the current and target composition of plan investments, our historical returns earned, and our expectations about the future.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe amount recorded before-tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our defined benefit plans consists of the following at December 31:\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022\nNet actuarial loss $ 333 $ 348\nNet prior service cost 15 15\nTotal $ 348 $ 363\nPlan Assets\nWe have investment committees that meet regularly to review portfolio returns and to determine asset-mix targets based on asset/liability studies. Third-party investment consultants assist these committees in developing asset allocation strategies to determine our expected rates of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. The investment committees considered these strategies in the formal establishment of the current asset-mix targets based on the projected risk and return levels for all major asset classes.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 72\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents the fair value of the plan assets at December 31:\n2023 2022\nDebt securities\nFixed income and cash investment funds $ 1,122 $ 1,482\nEquity securities\nGlobal equity securities (1)\n227 180\nU.S. equity securities (1)\n157 102\nInsurance contracts 103 100\nReal estate 34 53\nPrivate equities 35 37\nOther investments (2)\n402 313\nTotal plan assets $ 2,080 $ 2,266\n(1)Include direct investments and investment funds.\n(2)Consists primarily of asset allocation fund investments.\nPlan assets valued using Net Asset Value (\"NAV\") as a practical expedient amounted to $1,967 million and $2,157 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The percentages of plan assets valued using NAV by investment fund type for equity securities, fixed income and cash, and alternative investments were 20%, 57%, and 23% as of December 31, 2023, respectively, and 13%, 69%, and 18% as of December 31, 2022, respectively. Those investments that were measured at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient were excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The practical expedient was not applied for investments with a fair value of $113 million and $109 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were investments classified within Level 3 of $103 million and $100 million for non U.S. insurance contracts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFunding Policy\nThe funding policy for our Pension Benefits is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus such additional amounts as we may determine to be appropriate. In 2023, we contributed approximately $18 million, which includes benefit payments made directly to the employee for our unfunded plans. We anticipate we will contribute between approximately $40 million to $45 million to our pension plans in 2024.\nThe following table presents the expected benefit payments for Pension Benefits over the next 10 years. For funded Company sponsored plans, the benefit payments are made by the respective pension trust funds.\nYear Pension Benefits\n2024 $ 164\n2025 127\n2026 132\n2027 135\n2028 136\n2029-2033 717\nDEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS\nOur primary defined contribution plan during 2023 was the Company-sponsored U.S. 401(k) plan (\"401(k) Plan\"). The 401(k) Plan allows eligible employees to contribute portions of their eligible compensation to an investment trust. The Company matches employee contributions at the rate of $1.00 per $1.00 employee contribution for the first 5% of the employee's eligible compensation, and such contributions vest immediately. In\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 73\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\naddition, we make cash contributions for all eligible employees of 4% of their eligible compensation and such contributions are fully vested after three years of employment. The 401(k) Plan provides several investment options, for which the employee has sole investment discretion; however, the 401(k) Plan does not offer the Company's common stock as an investment option. Our costs for the 401(k) Plan and several other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans amounted to $217 million and $212 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe have two non-qualified defined contribution plans that are invested through trusts. The assets and corresponding liabilities were $281 million and $256 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in \"All other assets\" and \"Liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits,\" respectively, in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nNOTE 11. INCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent:\nU.S. $ 33 $ 6 $ 11\nForeign 711 489 614\nTotal current 744 495 625\nDeferred:\nU.S. (27) 40 (24)\nForeign (32) 65 157\nTotal deferred (59) 105 133\nProvision for income taxes $ 685 $ 600 $ 758\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted The Inflation Reduction Act which included a number of additional credits and deductions for businesses and individuals. The Inflation Reduction Act also included the adoption of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax in 2023, which is based on financial statement book income of large corporations. In 2023, the Company is not subject to the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax.\nThe geographic sources of income before income taxes consist of the following:\n2023 2022 2021\nU.S. $ 882 $ (698) $ (724)\nForeign 1,773 720 1,152\nIncome before income taxes\n$ 2,655 $ 22 $ 428\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 74\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the income before income taxes for the reasons set forth below for the years ended December 31:\n2023 2022 2021\nIncome before income taxes\n$ 2,655 $ 22 $ 428\nTaxes at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate\n558 5 90\nEffect of foreign operations (2)\n112 338 216\nTax impact of partnership structure\n(103) 6 137\nChange in valuation allowances (1)\n53 164 70\nTax expense (benefit) due to unrecognized tax benefits (5) (7) 201\nOther - net 70 94 44\nProvision for income taxes (3)\n$ 685 $ 600 $ 758\nActual income tax rate 25.8 % 2,727.3 % 177.1 %\n(1)For December 31, 2023, this amount was reduced by $81 million that is related to the release of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.\n(2)For December 31, 2022, $140 million of this amount relates to the charges associated with the sale and suspension of our Russia operations.\n(3)For December 31, 2021, $121 million of this amount was previously indemnified under the Tax Matters Agreement with General Electric (\"GE\") of which $119 million was included in tax expense due to unrecognized tax benefits. In December 2022, the Company and GE entered into an agreement to terminate the Tax Matters Agreement.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nAs a result of an internal reorganization completed on December 30, 2023, BHH LLC became a single member LLC thereby terminating the partnership for U.S. income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2023, U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities are now recorded based on the inside book basis versus tax basis difference and are no longer recorded based on the Company's outside basis difference in the BHH LLC partnership. As a result, in 2023 the deferred tax asset related to the investment in partnership has been adjusted accordingly and other deferred tax assets and liabilities, including PP&E, intangible assets, and lower tier investment in partnerships & subsidiaries, have been increased to reflect the tax effect of the inside basis difference of those respective assets and liabilities.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 75\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe tax effects of differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31 consist of the following:\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nOperating & capital loss carryforwards $ 3,332 $ 2,074\nTax credit & other carryforwards 936 1,087\nInvestment in partnerships & subsidiaries\n286 846\nProperty, plant and equipment\n169 128\nEmployee benefits 241 62\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\n137 46\nReceivables 111 94\nInventory 73 52\nOther\n181 163\nTotal deferred income tax asset 5,466 4,552\nValuation allowances\n(4,416) (4,090)\nTotal deferred income tax asset after valuation allowance 1,050 462\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\n(380) -\nFair value of derivative financial instruments\n(90) -\nOther\n(34) (34)\nTotal deferred income tax liability\n(504) (34)\nNet deferred tax asset $ 546 $ 428\nAt December 31, 2023, we had approximately $417 million of non-U.S. tax credits which may be carried forward indefinitely under applicable foreign law, $366 million of U.S. foreign tax credits and $153 million of other U.S. Federal and state tax credits and other carryforwards, the majority of which will expire after tax year 2027 under U.S. Federal and state tax law. Additionally, we had $3,299 million of net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"), of which approximately $252 million will expire within five years, $1,862 million will expire between six years and 20 years, and the remainder can be carried forward indefinitely. Lastly, we had $33 million of capital loss carryforwards, the majority of which can be carried forward indefinitely.\nWe record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. At December 31, 2023, $4,416 million of valuation allowances are recorded against various deferred tax assets, primarily related to foreign operating and capital losses of $2,987 million and U.S. foreign and non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $770 million.\nIndefinite reinvestment is determined by management\u2019s intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in the Company's active non-U.S. business operations. As of December 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of undistributed foreign earnings is approximately $3,708 million. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $467 million of tax liabilities for total gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. In addition to these uncertain tax positions, we had $83 million and $79 million related to interest and penalties, respectively, for total liabilities of $629 million for uncertain positions. If we were to prevail on all uncertain positions, the net effect would result in an income tax benefit of approximately $559 million. The remaining $71 million is comprised of $41 million for deferred tax assets that represent tax benefits that would be received in different taxing jurisdictions or in a different character and $30 million increased valuation allowances.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 76\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table presents the changes in our gross unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nAsset / (Liability) 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of year $ (496) $ (531)\nAdditions for tax positions of the current year (15) (19)\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years (50) (99)\nReductions for tax positions of prior years 32 100\nSettlements with tax authorities 26 24\nLapse of statute of limitations 36 29\nBalance at end of year $ (467) $ (496)\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, and competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of litigation in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately $40 million of tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, each of which are individually insignificant, and each of which are reasonably possible of being settled within the next twelve months.\nWe conduct business in more than 120 countries and are subject to income taxes in most taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, each of which may have multiple open years subject to examination. All Internal Revenue Service examinations have been completed and closed through 2015 for the most significant U.S. returns. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties in all jurisdictions.\nNOTE 12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has the Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTI Plan\") under which we may grant restricted stock units (\"RSU\"), performance share units (\"PSU\"), stock options and other equity-based awards to employees and non-employee directors providing services to the Company and our subsidiaries. The Company also provides an Employee Stock Purchase Plan for eligible employees. A total of up to 29.5 million shares of Class A common stock are reserved and available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the LTI Plan over its term which expires on the date of the annual meeting of the Company in 2031. A total of 25.1 million shares of Class A common stock are available for issuance as of December 31, 2023.\nStock-based compensation cost was $197 million, $207 million and $205 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant based on the calculated fair value of the award and is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the equity grant. The compensation cost is determined based on awards ultimately expected to vest; therefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures. There were no stock-based compensation costs capitalized as the amounts were not material.\nRestricted Stock\nWe may grant to our officers, directors and key employees RSUs, where each unit represents the right to receive, at the end of a stipulated period, one unrestricted share of stock with no exercise price. Certain RSUs are subject to cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging over a period of three years. Non-employee directors are granted RSUs that immediately vest on the grant date. Cash dividend equivalents are accumulated on RSUs and are payable upon vesting of the awards. We determine the fair value of RSUs based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 77\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table presents the changes in RSUs outstanding and related information (in thousands, except per unit prices):\nNumber of\nUnits Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue Per Unit\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2022 14,342 $ 24.31\nGranted 6,404 30.20\nVested (7,351) 23.60\nForfeited (1,282) 26.43\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2023 12,113 $ 27.70\nIn 2023, the total intrinsic value of RSUs vested (defined as the value of shares awarded based on the price of our common stock at vesting date) was $227 million and unvested RSUs was $414 million. The total grant date fair value of RSUs vested in 2023 was $173 million. As of December 31, 2023, there was $178 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.76 years.\nPerformance Share Units\nWe may grant PSUs to certain officers and key employees. The PSUs are stock-based awards tied to predefined company metrics and contain a payout modifier based on total shareholder return (\"TSR\"). PSUs generally cliff vest after a service period of three years. Cash dividend equivalents are accumulated on PSUs and are payable upon vesting of the awards. The fair value of the awards determined for the predefined company metrics are based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of the PSU awards is determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation method.\nThe following table presents the changes in PSUs outstanding and related information (in thousands, except per unit prices):\nNumber of\nUnits Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue Per Unit\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2022 3,525 $ 25.56\nGranted 1,222 30.17\nVested (827) 20.61\nCancelled (1)\n(563) 21.85\nForfeited (529) 29.06\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2023 2,828 $ 28.70\n(1)Includes adjustments based on achievement of predefined company metrics.\nThe total intrinsic value of PSUs vested and unvested, (defined as the value of the shares awarded at the year-end market price) was $23 million and $97 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The total grant date fair value of PSUs vested in 2023 was $17 million. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested PSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.89 years, was $28 million as of December 31, 2023.\nStock Options\nWe previously granted stock options to our officers, directors and key employees. Stock options generally vest in equal amounts over a vesting period of three years provided that the employee has remained continuously employed by the Company through such vesting date. We have not granted stock options to officers, directors, or key employees since 2019.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 78\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table presents the changes in stock options outstanding and related information (in thousands, except per option prices):\nNumber of\nOptions Weighted Average\nExercise Price\nPer Option\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 2,907 $ 33.02\nExercised (492) 26.44\nExpired (174) 39.79\nOutstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2023 2,241 $ 33.92\nThe weighted average remaining contractual term for options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2023 was 3.4 years. The maximum contractual term of options outstanding is 5.1 years.\nThere were nil, 530 thousand and 850 thousand options that vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total fair value of options vested was nil, $3 million and $7 million, in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was immaterial as of December 31, 2023.\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised (defined as the amount by which the market price of our common stock on the date of exercise exceeds the exercise price of the option) in 2023 was $3 million. The total intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2023 was $6 million. The intrinsic value of stock options outstanding is calculated as the amount by which the quoted price of $34.18 of our common stock as of the end of 2023 exceeds the exercise price of the options.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe employee stock purchase plan provides for eligible employees to purchase shares of Class A common stock quarterly on an after-tax basis in an amount between 1% and 20% of their annual pay at a 15% discount of the fair market value of our Class A common stock at the end of each quarterly offering period. An employee may not purchase more than $3,000 in any of the three-month measurement periods described above or $12,000 annually.\nA total of 21.5 million shares of Class A common stock are authorized for issuance, and at December 31, 2023, there were 8.7 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance.\nNOTE 13. EQUITY\nCOMMON STOCK\nWe are authorized to issue 2 billion shares of Class A common stock, 1.25 billion shares of Class B common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock each of which have a par value of $0.0001 per share. The number of shares outstanding of Class A and Class B common stock at December 31, 2023 is 998 million and nil, respectively. We have not issued any preferred stock. Each share of Class B common stock and the associated member units of BHH LLC form a paired interest. While each share of Class B common stock has equal voting rights to a share of Class A common stock, it has no economic rights, meaning holders of Class B common stock have no right to dividends or any assets in the event of liquidation of the Company. Our Class B common stock was previously held by GE. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.\nWe have a share repurchase program which we expect to fund from cash generated from operations, and we expect to make share repurchases from time to time subject to the Company's capital plan, market conditions, and other factors, including regulatory restrictions. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. In 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased and canceled 16.3 million and 29.7 million shares of Class A common stock, each for $538 million and $828 million, representing an average price per share of $33.09 and $27.91, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had authorization remaining to repurchase up to approximately $2.2 billion of its Class A common stock.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 79\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table presents the changes in the number of shares outstanding (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nClass A Common Stock Class B Common Stock Class A Common Stock Class B Common Stock\nBalance at beginning of year 1,005,960 - 909,142 116,548\nIssue of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units (1)\n5,738 - 6,316 -\nIssue of shares on exercise of stock options (1)\n434 - 1,632 -\nIssue of shares for employee stock purchase plan\n1,846 - 2,017 -\nExchange of Class B common stock for Class A common stock (2)\n- - 116,548 (116,548)\nRepurchase and cancellation of Class A common stock (16,269) - (29,694) -\nBalance at end of year 997,709 - 1,005,960 -\n(1) Share amounts reflected above are net of shares withheld to satisfy the employee's tax withholding obligation.\n(2) When shares of Class B common stock, together with associated BHH LLC member units (\"LLC Units\"), were exchanged for shares of Class A common stock, such shares of Class B common stock were canceled.\nDuring 2023 and 2022, the Company declared and paid aggregate regular dividends of $0.78 and $0.73 per share, respectively, to holders of record of the Company's Class A common stock.\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS (\"AOCL\")\nThe following tables present the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax:\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments Cash Flow Hedges Benefit Plans Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ (2,125) $ (10) $ (250) $ (2,385)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (294) (1) 2 (293)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n25 3 27 55\nDeferred taxes\n- - (43) (43)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) (269) 2 (14) (281)\nLess: Other comprehensive loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (3) - - (3)\nLess: Reallocation of AOCL based on change in ownership of BHH LLC Units 275 1 32 308\nBalance at December 31, 2022 (2,666) (9) (296) (2,971)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n153 12 (14) 151\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n- (8) 28 20\nDeferred taxes\n- (1) 5 4\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 153 3 19 175\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ (2,513) $ (6) $ (277) $ (2,796)\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 80\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 represent (i) gains (losses) reclassified on cash flow hedges when the hedged transaction occurs, (ii) the amortization of net actuarial gain (loss), prior service credit, settlements, and curtailments which are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost (see \"Note 10. Employee Benefit Plans\" for additional details), and (iii) the release of foreign currency translation adjustments.\nNOTE 14.

As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted EPS of Class B under the two class method has not been presented. The basic weighted average shares outstanding for our Class B common stock were nil, 30 million, and 215 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The basic weighted average shares outstanding for both our Class A and Class B common stock combined were 1,008 million, 1,017 million, and 1,039 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Class A diluted shares include the dilutive impact of equity awards except for approximately 2 million options that were excluded because the exercise price exceeded the average market price of our Class A common stock and is therefore antidilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we excluded all outstanding equity awards from the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect is antidilutive.\nNOTE 15.

We measured our investments at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets.\nGains (losses) recorded to earnings for our equity securities with readily determinable fair values were $435 million, $(264) million, and $(843) million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gains (losses) related to our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are reported in \"Other non-operating income (loss), net\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nOTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value were remeasured as of the date that an observable transaction occurred, which resulted in the Company recording a gain of $118 million. Gains (losses) related to our equity securities without readily determinable fair values are reported in \"Other non-operating income (loss), net\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nFAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nOur financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, current receivables, certain investments, accounts payable, short and long-term debt, and derivative financial instruments. Except for long-term debt, the estimated fair value of these financial instruments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 approximates their carrying value as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. For further information on the fair value of our debt, see \"Note 9. Debt.\"\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING\nWe use derivatives to manage our risks and do not use derivatives for speculation. The table below summarizes the fair value of all derivatives, including hedging instruments and embedded derivatives.\n2023 2022\nAssets (Liabilities) Assets (Liabilities)\nDerivatives accounted for as hedges\nCurrency exchange contracts\n$ 10 $ (3) $ 1 $ -\nInterest rate swap contracts - (52) - (69)\nDerivatives not accounted for as hedges\nCurrency exchange contracts and other\n24 (21) 17 (17)\nTotal derivatives $ 34 $ (76) $ 18 $ (86)\nDerivatives are classified in the consolidated statements of financial position depending on their respective maturity date.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $23 million and $17 million of derivative liabilities are recorded in \"All other current liabilities\" and $53 million and $69 million are recorded in \"All other liabilities\" in the consolidated statements of financial position, respectively.\nFORMS OF HEDGING\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, the vast majority of our derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts. In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk fluctuations in connection with long-term debt that we issue from time to time to fund our operations. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in a separate component of equity (referred to as \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\" or \"AOCI\") and are recorded in earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction occurs. See \"Note 13. Equity\" for further information on activity in AOCI for cash flow hedges. The maximum term of cash flow hedges that hedge forecasted transactions was approximately two years and one year at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFair Value Hedges\nAll of our long-term debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments. We are subject to interest rate risk on our debt portfolio and may use interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $500 million that converted a portion of our $1,350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.337% fixed rate Senior Notes due 2027 into a floating rate instrument with an interest rate based on a LIBOR index as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk. As of July 1, 2023, the interest rate changed to be based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate index. We concluded that the interest rate swap met the criteria necessary to qualify for the short-cut method of hedge accounting, and as such, an assumption is made that the change in the fair value of the hedged debt, due to changes in the benchmark rate, exactly offsets the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps. Therefore, the derivative is considered to be effective at achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged liability, and no ineffectiveness is recognized. The mark-to-market of this fair value hedge is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is equally offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense.\nNOTIONAL AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVES\nThe notional amount of a derivative is used to determine, along with the other terms of the derivative, the amounts to be exchanged between the counterparties. We disclose the derivative notional amounts on a gross basis to indicate the total counterparty risk but it does not generally represent amounts exchanged by us and the counterparties. A substantial majority of the outstanding notional amount of $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is related to hedges of anticipated sales and purchases in foreign currency, commodity purchases, changes in interest rates, and contractual terms in contracts that are considered embedded derivatives and for intercompany borrowings in foreign currencies.\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK\nFair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market movements and changes in our positions. We manage counterparty credit risk (the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our agreements) on an individual counterparty basis.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 83\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 16. REVENUE RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nDISAGGREGATED REVENUE\nWe disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by product line for both our OFSE and IET segments, as we believe this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. In addition, management views revenue from contracts with customers for OFSE by geography based on the location to where the product is shipped or the services are performed.\nEffective October 1, 2023, IET began operating through five product lines - Gas Technology Equipment, which will now include the Pumps business; Gas Technology Services; Industrial Solutions, which brings together the Condition Monitoring and PSI businesses, along with IET Digital initiatives; Industrial Products, which brings together the Inspection business merging with the Valves and Gears businesses; and a newly formed product line, Climate Technology Solutions, which will combine our carbon capture, utilization and storage (\"CCUS\"), hydrogen, clean power and emissions abatement capabilities, that previously was reported in each of the individual IET product lines, into one business focused on serving the energy transition. The financial information for 2022 and 2021 have been recast to conform to the new product line presentation.\nThe series of tables below present our revenue disaggregated by these categories.\nTotal Revenue 2023 2022 2021\nWell Construction $ 4,387 $ 3,854 $ 3,301\nCompletions, Intervention & Measurements 4,170 3,559 3,106\nProduction Solutions 3,854 3,587 3,135\nSubsea & Surface Pressure Systems 2,950 2,230 2,486\nOilfield Services & Equipment 15,361 13,229 12,028\nGas Technology Equipment\n4,232 2,599 3,039\nGas Technology Services\n2,600 2,440 2,696\nTotal Gas Technology 6,832 5,039 5,735\nIndustrial Products\n1,962 1,697 1,598\nIndustrial Solutions\n983 884 880\nControls (1)\n41 208 217\nTotal Industrial Technology 2,987 2,789 2,695\nClimate Technology Solutions\n326 98 43\nIndustrial & Energy Technology 10,145 7,926 8,473\nTotal $ 25,506 $ 21,156 $ 20,502\n(1)The sale of Nexus Controls business was completed in April 2023.\nOilfield Services & Equipment Geographic Revenue 2023 2022 2021\nNorth America $ 4,116 $ 3,764 $ 2,904\nLatin America 2,761 2,099 1,681\nEurope/CIS/Sub-Saharan Africa 2,655 2,483 2,865\nMiddle East/Asia 5,829 4,883 4,579\nOilfield Services & Equipment $ 15,361 $ 13,229 $ 12,028\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 84\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $33.5 billion. As of December 31, 2023, we expect to recognize revenue of approximately 61%, 74% and 90% of the total remaining performance obligations within 2, 5, and 15 years, respectively, and the remaining thereafter. Contract modifications could affect both the timing to complete as well as the amount to be received as we fulfill the related remaining performance obligations.\nNOTE 17. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company's segments are determined as those operations whose results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), who is our Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We report our operating results through two operating segments, OFSE and IET. Each segment is organized and managed based upon the nature of our markets and customers and consists of similar products and services. These products and services operate across upstream oil and gas and broader energy and industrial markets. The following is a description of each segment's business operations:\nOilfield Services & Equipment provides products and services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of a well, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development, to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning. OFSE is organized into four product lines: Well Construction, which encompasses drilling services, drill bits, and drilling & completions fluids; Completions, Intervention, and Measurements, which encompasses well completions, pressure pumping, and wireline services; Production Solutions, which spans artificial lift systems and oilfield & industrial chemicals; and Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems, which encompasses subsea projects services and drilling systems, surface pressure control, and flexible pipe systems. Beyond its traditional oilfield concentration, OFSE is expanding its capabilities and technology portfolio to meet the challenges of a net-zero future. These efforts include expanding into new energy areas such as geothermal and CCUS, strengthening its digital architecture and addressing key energy market themes.\nIndustrial & Energy Technology provides technology solutions and services for mechanical-drive, compression and power-generation applications across the energy industry, including oil and gas, LNG operations, downstream refining and petrochemical markets, as well as lower carbon solutions to broader energy and industrial sectors. IET also provides equipment, software, and services that serve a wide range of industries including petrochemical and refining, nuclear, aviation, automotive, mining, cement, metals, pulp and paper, and food and beverage. IET is organized into five product lines - Gas Technology Equipment, Gas Technology Services, Industrial Products, Industrial Solutions, and Climate Technology Solutions.\nRevenue and operating income for each segment are used by the CODM to assess the performance of each segment in a financial period. The performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, inventory impairments, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments. Consistent accounting policies have been applied by all segments within the Company, for all reporting periods. Intercompany revenue and expense amounts have been eliminated within each segment to report on the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment performance. Summarized financial information for the Company's segments is shown in the following tables.\nRevenue\n2023 2022 2021\nOilfield Services & Equipment $ 15,361 $ 13,229 $ 12,028\nIndustrial & Energy Technology 10,145 7,926 8,473\nTotal $ 25,506 $ 21,156 $ 20,502\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 85\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIncome before income taxes\n2023 2022 2021\nOilfield Services & Equipment $ 1,746 $ 1,201 $ 830\nIndustrial & Energy Technology 1,310 1,135 1,177\nTotal segment 3,055 2,336 2,006\nCorporate (380) (416) (429)\nInventory impairment (1)\n(35) (31) -\nRestructuring, impairment and other (323) (705) (269)\nOther non-operating income (loss), net 554 (911) (583)\nInterest expense, net (216) (252) (299)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 2,655 $ 22 $ 428\n(1)Charges for inventory impairments are reported in \"Cost of goods sold\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nThe following table presents total assets at December 31:\nAssets\n2023 2022\nOilfield Services & Equipment $ 17,925 $ 17,181\nIndustrial & Energy Technology 13,781 12,286\nTotal segment 31,706 29,467\nCorporate and eliminations (1)\n5,239 4,714\nTotal $ 36,945 $ 34,181\n(1)The assets in Corporate and eliminations consist primarily of the Baker Hughes trade name, cash, and tax assets.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nWe have an aeroderivative joint venture (\"Aero JV\") we formed with GE in 2019. The Aero JV is jointly controlled by GE and us, each with ownership interest of 50%, and therefore, we do not consolidate the Aero JV. We had purchases from the Aero JV of $517 million, $528 million, and $603 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have $71 million and $110 million of accounts payable at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for products and services provided by the Aero JV in the ordinary course of business. Sales of products and services and related receivables with the Aero JV were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, GE's ownership interest in the Company and BHH LLC was reduced to less than 5%. As a result, considering all aspects of our relationship with GE, as of June 30, 2022, we no longer considered GE a related party. We had purchases with GE and its affiliates of $293 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022, and $716 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. In addition, we sold products and services to GE and its affiliates for $83 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022, and $185 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLITIGATION\nWe are subject to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Because legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters. We record a liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Based on the opinion of management, we do not expect the ultimate outcome of currently pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters.\nOn July 31, 2018, International Engineering & Construction S.A. (\"IEC\") initiated arbitration proceedings in New York administered by the International Center for Dispute Resolution (\"ICDR\") against the Company and its subsidiaries arising out of a series of sales and service contracts entered between IEC and the Company's subsidiaries for the sale and installation of LNG plants and related power generation equipment in Nigeria (\"Contracts\"). Prior to the filing of the IEC Arbitration, the Company's subsidiaries made demands for payment due under the Contracts. On August 15, 2018, the Company's subsidiaries initiated a separate demand for ICDR arbitration against IEC for claims of additional costs and amounts due under the Contracts. On October 10, 2018, IEC filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company seeking to compel non-signatory Baker Hughes entities to participate in the arbitration filed by IEC. The complaint is captioned International Engineering & Construction S.A. et al. v. Baker Hughes, a GE\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 87\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ncompany, LLC, et al. No. 18-cv-09241 (\"S.D.N.Y 2018\"); this action was dismissed by the Court on August 13, 2019. In the arbitration, IEC alleges breach of contract and other claims against the Company and its subsidiaries and seeks recovery of alleged compensatory damages, in addition to reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and arbitration costs. On March 15, 2019, IEC amended its request for arbitration to alleged damages of $591 million of lost profits plus unspecified additional costs based on alleged non-performance of the contracts in dispute. The arbitration hearing was held from December 9, 2019 to December 20, 2019. On March 3, 2020, IEC amended their damages claim to $700 million of alleged loss cash flow or, in the alternative, $244.9 million of lost profits and various costs based on alleged non-performance of the contracts in dispute, and in addition $4.8 million of liquidated damages, $58.6 million in take-or-pay costs of feed gas, and unspecified additional costs of rectification and take-or-pay future obligations, plus unspecified interest and attorneys' fees. On May 3, 2020, the arbitration panel dismissed IEC's request for take-or-pay damages. On May 29, 2020, IEC quantified their claim for legal fees at $14.2 million and reduced their alternative claim from $244.9 million to approximately $235 million. The Company and its subsidiaries have contested IEC's claims and are pursuing claims for compensation under the contracts. On October 31, 2020, the ICDR notified the arbitration panel's final award, which dismissed the majority of IEC's claims and awarded a portion of the Company's claims. On January 27, 2021, IEC filed a petition to vacate the arbitral award in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York. On March 5, 2021, the Company filed a petition to confirm the arbitral award, and on March 8, 2021, the Company removed the matter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On November 16, 2021, the court granted the Company's petition to confirm the award and denied IEC's petition to vacate. During the second quarter of 2022, IEC paid the amounts owed under the arbitration award, which had an immaterial impact on the Company's financial statements. On February 3, 2022, IEC initiated another arbitration proceeding in New York administered by the ICDR against certain of the Company's subsidiaries arising out of the same project which formed the basis of the first arbitration. On March 25, 2022, the Company's subsidiaries initiated a separate demand for ICDR arbitration against IEC for claims of additional costs and amounts due; such claims against IEC have now been resolved, with any consideration having an immaterial impact on the Company's financial statements. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the proceeding which is pending against the Company's subsidiaries.\nOn March 15, 2019 and March 18, 2019, the City of Riviera Beach Pension Fund and Richard Schippnick, respectively, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery shareholder derivative lawsuits for and on the Company's behalf against GE, the then-current members of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Company as a nominal defendant, related to the decision to (i) terminate the contractual prohibition barring GE from selling any of the Company's shares before July 3, 2019; (ii) repurchase $1.5 billion in the Company's stock from GE; (iii) permit GE to sell approximately $2.5 billion in the Company's stock through a secondary offering; and (iv) enter into a series of other agreements and amendments that will govern the ongoing relationship between the Company and GE (collectively, the \"2018 Transactions\"). The complaints in both lawsuits allege, among other things, that GE, as the Company's controlling stockholder, and the members of the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the 2018 Transactions. The relief sought in the complaints includes a request for a declaration that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, that GE was unjustly enriched, disgorgement of profits, an award of damages sustained by the Company, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys' fees and costs. On March 21, 2019, the Chancery Court entered an order consolidating the Schippnick and City of Riviera Beach complaints under consolidated C.A. No. 2019-0201-AGB, styled in re Baker Hughes, a GE company derivative litigation. On May 10, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the members of the Company's Conflicts Committee, and on May 15, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against former Baker Hughes director Martin Craighead. On June 7, 2019, the defendants and nominal defendant filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the derivative plaintiffs failed to make a demand on the Company's Board of Directors to pursue the claims itself, and GE and the Company's Board of Directors filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The Chancery Court denied the motions on October 8, 2019, except granted GE's motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim against it. On October 31, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors designated a Special Litigation Committee and empowered it with full authority to investigate and evaluate the allegations and issues raised in the derivative litigation. The Special Litigation Committee filed a motion to stay the derivative litigation during its investigation. On December 3, 2019, the Chancery Court granted the motion and stayed the derivative litigation until June 1, 2020. On May 20, 2020, the Chancery Court granted an extension of the stay to October 1, 2020, and on September 29, 2020, the Court granted a further extension of the stay to October 15, 2020. On October 13, 2020, the Special Litigation Committee filed its report with the Court. On April 17, 2023, the Court granted the Special Litigation\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 88\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCommittee's motion to terminate the litigation. On May 16, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On February 1, 2024, the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware affirmed the judgment of the Court of Chancery.\nOn or around February 15, 2023, the lead plaintiff and three additional named plaintiffs in a putative securities class action styled The Reckstin Family Trust, et al., v. C3.ai, Inc., et al., No. 4:22-cv-01413-HSG, filed an amended class action complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\") in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Amended Complaint names the following as defendants: (i) C3.ai., Inc. (\"C3 AI\"), (ii) certain of C3 AI's current and/or former officers and directors, (iii) certain underwriters for the C3 AI initial public offering (the \"IPO\"), and (iv) the Company, and its President and CEO (who formerly served as a director on the board of C3 AI). The Amended Complaint alleges violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") in connection with the IPO and the subsequent period between December 9, 2020 and December 2, 2021, during which BHH LLC held equity investments in C3 AI. The action seeks unspecified damages and the award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of these proceedings.\nWe insure against risks arising from our business to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending or future legal proceedings or other claims. Most of our insurance policies contain deductibles or self-insured retentions in amounts we deem prudent and for which we are responsible for payment. In determining the amount of self-insurance, it is our policy to self-insure those losses that are predictable, measurable and recurring in nature, such as claims for automobile liability, general liability and workers compensation.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nItem 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. The Company uses a threshold of $1 million for such proceedings. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period.\nEstimated remediation costs are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and enacted laws and regulations. Our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. Accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such costs can be reasonably estimated. As additional information becomes available, accruals are adjusted to reflect current cost estimates.\nOTHER\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees. We also provide a guarantee to GE Capital on behalf of a customer who entered into a financing arrangement with GE Capital. Total off-balance sheet arrangements were approximately $5.1 billion at December 31, 2023. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. As of December 31, 2023, none of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also had commitments outstanding for purchase obligations for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2028 of $1,871 million, $366 million, $220 million, $215 million and $47 million, respectively, and $27 million in the aggregate thereafter.\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects primarily in our OFSE segment. Under such arrangements, each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work, and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed. The failure or inability, financially or otherwise, of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us. These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project, liquidated damages or contract disputes.\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 89\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 20. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER\nWe recorded restructuring, impairment and other charges of $323 million, $705 million, and $269 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\nIn 2023, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $313 million. In 2022, we announced a corporate restructuring plan in conjunction with a change in our operating segments (the \"2022 Plan\"). We continued to incur charges in 2023 related to our 2022 Plan primarily for employee termination expenses. Restructuring charges for 2023 also include costs under a new plan (the \"2023 Plan\") primarily for employee termination expenses related to exit activities at specific locations in our segments to align with our market outlook and rationalize our manufacturing supply chain footprint. These actions also included inventory impairments of $35 million in 2023, recorded in \"Cost of goods sold\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss). In the fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred additional costs related to a planned workforce reduction, primarily in OFSE.\nIn 2022, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $196 million. The charges are related to our 2022 Plan and are primarily for employee termination expenses driven by actions taken by the Company to facilitate the reorganization into two segments and corporate restructuring. In addition, PP&E impairments and other costs were recorded related to exit activities at specific locations in the OFSE segment.\nIn 2021, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling $138 million. Charges incurred were primarily related to the continuation of our overall strategy to restructure our business, which was designed to optimize our structural costs for the year-over-year change in activity levels and market conditions.\nThe following table presents the restructuring and impairment charges by the impacted segment; however, these net charges are not included in the reported segment results.\n2023 2022 2021\nOilfield Services & Equipment $ 148 $ 121 $ 121\nIndustrial & Energy Technology 98 36 11\nCorporate 67 39 6\nTotal $ 313 $ 196 $ 138\nThe following table presents restructuring and impairment charges by type, and includes gains on the dispositions of certain property, plant and equipment as a consequence of exit activities:\n2023 2022 2021\nProperty, plant and equipment $ (2) $ 58 $ 7\nEmployee-related termination expenses 270 121 99\nAsset relocation costs 5 3 20\nContract termination fees 1 1 2\nOther incremental costs 39 13 10\nTotal $ 313 $ 196 $ 138\nOTHER CHARGES\nOther charges included in \"Restructuring, impairment and other\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss) were $10 million, $509 million, and $131 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn 2022, other charges were primarily associated with the discontinuation of our Russia operations. As a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we took actions to suspend substantially all of our operational activities related to Russia. These actions resulted in other charges of $334 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 90\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nprimarily associated with the suspension of contracts including all our IET LNG contracts, and the impairment of assets consisting primarily of contract assets, PP&E and reserve for accounts receivable. In addition to these charges, we recorded inventory impairments of $31 million primarily in IET as a result of suspending our Russia operations, which are reported in \"Cost of goods sold\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nIn 2022, we also recorded other charges of $84 million in our OFSE segment primarily related to the impairment of PP&E and intangibles for the subsea production systems business due to a decrease in the estimated future cash flows driven by a decline in our long-term market outlook for this business, and $68 million in our IET segment primarily related to a write-off of an equity method investment and the release of foreign currency translation adjustments. In 2021, other charges were primarily related to certain litigation matters in our IET segment and the release of foreign currency translation adjustments for certain restructured product lines in our IET segment. The 2022 and 2021 charges also include separation related costs.\nNOTE 21. BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND ACQUISITIONS\nDISPOSITIONS\nWe completed several business dispositions over the past three years as described below. Any gain or loss on a business disposition is reported in \"Other non-operating income (loss), net\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nDuring 2023, we completed the sale of businesses and received total cash consideration $293 million. The dispositions consisted primarily of the sale of our Nexus Controls business in the IET segment to GE in April 2023, which resulted in an immaterial gain. Nexus Controls specializes in scalable industrial controls systems, safety systems, hardware, and software cybersecurity solutions and services. GE will continue to provide Baker Hughes with GE's MarkTM controls products currently in the Nexus Controls portfolio, and we will be the exclusive supplier and service provider of such GE products for our oil and gas customers' control needs.\nThe following table presents financial information related to the assets and liabilities of our Nexus Controls business classified as held for sale and reported in \"All other current assets\" and \"All other current liabilities\" in the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2022.\nAssets and liabilities of business held for sale Nexus Controls\nAssets\nCurrent receivables $ 59\nInventories 36\nProperty, plant and equipment 2\nGoodwill 230\nOther assets 10\nTotal assets of business held for sale 337\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable 30\nAll other current liabilities 56\nOther liabilities 7\nTotal liabilities of business held for sale 93\nTotal net assets of business held for sale $ 244\nDuring 2022, we sold part of our OFSE Russia business to local management for a nominal amount, which resulted in a loss before income taxes of $451 million.\nDuring 2021, we closed a transaction with Akastor ASA to create a joint venture company (\"JV Company\") to deliver global offshore drilling solutions. We contributed our subsea drilling systems business, a division of our\nBaker Hughes Company 2023 Form 10-K | 91\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOFSE segment, to the JV Company and received as consideration 50% of the shares of the JV Company, cash of $70 million, and a promissory note of $80 million. The transaction resulted in an immaterial gain.\nACQUISITIONS\nDuring 2023, we completed the acquisition of businesses for total cash consideration of $301 million, net of cash acquired, which consisted primarily of the acquisition of Altus Intervention in the OFSE segment in April 2023. Altus Intervention is a leading international provider of well intervention services and downhole technology. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in these acquisitions were recorded based on preliminary estimates of their fair values as of the acquisition date. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded $138 million of goodwill and $58 million of intangible assets, subject to final fair value adjustments. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring 2022, we completed several acquisitions for total cash consideration of $767 million, net of cash acquired of $50 million, subject to the finalization of post-closing working capital adjustments. The transactions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
