    "item_1": "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS\nBACKGROUND\nOverview and Mission\nIntuit is a global financial technology platform with a mission to power prosperity around the world. Our platform helps consumers and small and mid-market businesses prosper by delivering financial management, compliance, and marketing products and services. We also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals, who are key partners that help us serve small and mid-market business customers.\nAcross our platform, we use the power of data and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver three core benefits to our customers: helping put more money in their pockets, saving them time by eliminating work, and ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make. We help consumers do their taxes with ease and confidence, understand their financial picture, build credit, save more to make ends meet, get their largest tax refund, pay off debt, and receive personalized suggestions on how to grow their money. We help small and mid-market businesses grow and run their business all in one place, including bookkeeping, getting paid, accessing capital, paying employees, getting and retaining customers, and managing their customer relationships.\nWe do this through our global AI-driven expert platform and our offerings including TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp. We serve approximately 100 million customers and generated revenue of $16.3 billion in our fiscal year ended July 31, 2024.\nIntuit Inc. was incorporated in California in March 1984. We reincorporated in Delaware and completed our initial public offering in March 1993. Our principal executive offices are located at 2700 Coast Avenue, Mountain View, California, 94043, and our main telephone number is 650-944-6000. When we refer to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cIntuit\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation (Intuit Inc.) and its California predecessor, as well as all of our consolidated subsidiaries.\nOur Business Portfolio\nWe organize our businesses into four reportable segments:\nOur Business and Growth Strategy\nThe era of AI is one of the most significant technological shifts in decades, igniting global innovations at incredible pace. Intuit made an early bet on AI, declaring its AI-driven expert platform strategy in 2019 to deliver on its mission of powering prosperity for consumers and small and mid-market businesses. Our strategy, combined with our five Big Bets that focus on the largest customer problems and growth opportunities, positions us for durable growth in the future. Our scale of data, our investment in AI capabilities such as knowledge engineering, machine learning, and generative AI (GenAI), and our network of AI-powered virtual experts give us significant advantage as we deliver reimagined customer experiences.\nWith the introduction of GenAI, we are transforming how we strive to serve our customers by delivering \u201cdone for you\u201d experiences, where we do the hard work for them, and connecting them with AI-powered human expertise to fuel their\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nsuccess. We use powerful and relevant contextual data sets spanning small business, consumer finance, and tax to deliver personalized financial insights to customers across our platform.\nAdditionally, our investment in AI, GenAI, data, and world-class developer tools in particular, provides a foundation for us to accelerate productivity, innovate at scale, and move with speed to deliver benefits to our customers. This includes utilizing our own financial large language models (LLMs), as well as models from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way.\nAs we execute our global AI-driven expert platform strategy, we prioritize resources on our five Big Bets across the company. These priorities focus on solving the problems that matter most to customers and include:\n\u2022Revolutionizing speed to benefit: When customers use our products and services, we use the power of AI to deliver value instantly and aim to make interactions with our offerings frictionless, without the need for customers to manually enter data. We are accelerating the application of AI to deliver \u201cdone for you\u201d experiences to our customers. This is foundational, and execution against this priority positions us to succeed with our other four Big Bets.\n\u2022Connecting people to experts: The largest problem our customers face is lack of confidence to file their own taxes or to manage their books. To build their confidence, we connect our customers to experts. We offer customers access to experts to help them make important decisions - and experts, such as accountants, gain access to new customers so they can grow their businesses. We are also expanding our virtual expert network and broadening the segments we serve beyond tax and accounting to play a more meaningful role in our customers\u2019 financial lives.\n\u2022Unlocking smart money decisions: To address the challenges of high-cost debt and lack of savings, we are creating a comprehensive, self-driving financial platform with Credit Karma that propels our members forward wherever they are on their financial journey, so they can understand their financial picture, make smart financial decisions, and stick to their financial plan in the near term and long term.\n\u2022Be the center of small business growth: Globally, we are focused on helping customers grow their businesses by offering a broad, seamless set of tools that are designed to help them get and retain customers, get paid faster, manage and get access to capital, pay employees with confidence, and use third-party apps to help run their businesses. Our money solutions enable customers to manage their money and improve cash flow. This is an important driver to improving the success of our small and mid-market business customers.\n\u2022Disrupt the small business mid-market: We aim to disrupt the mid-market with a tailor-made, integrated ecosystem, which includes our QuickBooks offerings, as well as our workforce solutions and money offerings. These solutions are designed to address the needs of mid-market business customers with 10 to 100 employees. Mailchimp\u2019s marketing offerings enable mid-market businesses to digitally promote their business across email, social media, landing pages, ads, websites, and more, all from one place. These offerings enable us to increase retention of these larger customers and accelerate mid-market demand.\nWe believe our Big Bets enable us to deliver a QuickBooks and Mailchimp platform that serves as the source of truth for small and mid-market business customers, providing end-to-end solutions to increase their revenue and profitability, fueling their business success. For consumers, we are creating seamless, end-to-end experiences that customers benefit from year-round with TurboTax and Credit Karma, helping them make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save more, pay off debt, and take steps to improve their financial health.\nAs the external environment evolves, we continue to innovate and adapt our strategy and anticipate our customers\u2019 needs. For more than 40 years, we have been dedicated to developing innovative solutions that are designed to solve our customers' most important financial problems. At Intuit, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to prosper, and we never stop working to find new, innovative ways to make that possible.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nDuring fiscal 2024, we offered our products and services in the four segments described in \u201cOur Business Portfolio\u201d above. The following table shows the percentage of total revenue contributed by each of these segments over the last three fiscal years.\nTotal international net revenue was approximately 8% of consolidated total net revenue in each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nFor financial information about our reportable segments, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nSmall Business & Self-Employed\nOur Small Business & Self-Employed segment serves small and mid-market businesses around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. Our goal is for QuickBooks to be the source of truth for each small and mid-market business customer who uses our AI-driven expert platform.\nSmall and mid-market business owners are constantly faced with challenges and barriers in their journey to success. Universally, small businesses at every stage of growth struggle to get customers, get paid, get capital, pay workers, get access to advice, and stay compliant and organized. Our innovative customer growth platform provides actionable, AI-driven insights our customers need to grow and run their businesses with confidence.\nGet Customers\nMailchimp. Mailchimp is an all-in-one marketing platform for growing businesses. Mailchimp\u2019s marketing platform enables small and mid-market businesses to digitally promote their businesses across email, social media, short message service (SMS), landing pages, ads, websites, and more, all from one place.\nGet Paid\nPayment Processing Solutions. Our full range of merchant services for small and mid-market businesses includes credit card, debit card, Apple Pay, and ACH payment services for in-person and card-not-present payments. We offer instant deposit and payments dispute protection options for eligible customers. QuickBooks Payments is deeply integrated into our QuickBooks Online and Desktop offerings through seamless onboarding and automated transaction reconciliation and is the default payment solution for QuickBooks invoicing.\nQuickBooks Checking. The QuickBooks Checking business bank account comes with a physical and virtual debit card for more spending power, fast payments with no-fee Instant Deposit, and powerful cash flow management with envelopes for partitioning funds for future expenses, all with no fees.\nBill Pay. Our QuickBooks Online offerings allow small and mid-market businesses to organize bills and make payments online. Small and mid-market businesses can connect with vendors and automatically import bills through our network, resulting in easier and faster payments.\nGet Capital\nCapital. We offer financing options for small and mid-market businesses to help them get the capital they need to succeed. The financing process provides customers with the ability to use their QuickBooks data to qualify to borrow capital, whether directly from Intuit via term loans or from a third-party partner. Additionally, QuickBooks Line of Credit provides flexible access to capital through pre-approved credit limits. Qualified small and mid-market businesses can choose to borrow funds through a series of term loans within a maximum approved credit limit.\nPay Workers\nWorkforce Solutions. Our payroll solutions, available as online or desktop solutions, are sold on a subscription basis and integrate with our QuickBooks Online and Desktop offerings or may be purchased standalone. Our QuickBooks Online payroll offerings include automated tax payments and filings, as well as access to human resources solutions and employee benefits\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nofferings like health insurance and 401(k) plans. We also offer QuickBooks Time, which seamlessly integrates with QuickBooks Payroll and third-party payroll products to help businesses easily and accurately track time across a mobile workforce, including tools for project planning, job costing, and tracking per-client billable hours.\nAccess Advice\nQuickBooks Live. Small businesses can get support through two QuickBooks Live bookkeeping services: Assisted and Full-Service Bookkeeping. With QuickBooks Live Expert Assisted, small businesses have on-demand access to expert bookkeepers who can provide guidance and support on managing their books and making smart business decisions. With QuickBooks Live Full-Service Bookkeeping, small businesses get one-on-one support from our team of expert bookkeepers to manage and maintain books with guaranteed accuracy. Our experienced bookkeepers are certified QuickBooks ProAdvisors, and many are Certified Public Accountants.\nQuickBooks ProAdvisor. Accounting professionals can assist with bookkeeping, taxes, payroll, and more. Our free Find a ProAdvisor service helps customers find a QuickBooks Certified accountant or bookkeeper who knows their niche, speaks their language, or is close by. To enable our network of hundreds of thousands of accountants, we offer memberships to the QuickBooks ProAdvisor program, which provides accountants access to QuickBooks Online Accountant, technical support, training, product certification, marketing tools, and discounts on Intuit products and services purchased on behalf of clients.\nStay Compliant & Organized\nQuickBooks Online. Designed for all kinds of small businesses, QuickBooks Online helps simplify accounting and tax compliance. Users can track income and expenses, create and send invoices and estimates, manage and pay bills, and review a variety of financial reports. QuickBooks Online also has powerful industry-specific capabilities such as features for product-based businesses. QuickBooks Online is an open platform, enabling third-party developers to create online and mobile applications that integrate with our offering.\nWe offer different QuickBooks Online solutions depending on the size and complexity of the small business, including Simple Start, Essentials, and Plus. Additionally, we offer QuickBooks Online Advanced designed for mid-market businesses with 10 to 100 employees that have more complex needs, and QuickBooks Self-Employed and QuickBooks Solopreneur designed for independent contractors and solo entrepreneurs.\nQuickBooks Desktop Software.

This offering provides industry-specific reports and features for a range of industries, including Contractor, Manufacturing and Wholesale, Nonprofit, and Retail.\nFinancial Supplies. We offer a range of financial supplies designed for individuals and small businesses that use our QuickBooks offerings. These include standard paper checks and Secure Plus checks with CheckLock fraud protection features, a variety of stationery, tax forms, and related supplies.\nConsumer\nOur Consumer segment includes our TurboTax products and services that are designed to enable consumers and small businesses to prepare and file their federal and state income tax returns quickly and accurately. These offerings are available either online or as desktop versions in the U.S. and Canada. They are designed to be easy to use, yet sophisticated enough for complex tax returns. For the 2023 tax season, we offered a variety of commercial software products and tax filing services to meet the different needs of our customers, including those who file simple returns, those who itemize deductions, those who own investments or rental property, and small business owners. We offered TurboTax for small businesses, which enables customers to file their business taxes. We offer TurboTax Live for customers seeking to obtain tax advice from professionals and TurboTax Live Full Service for customers seeking to have their tax returns prepared for them. Customers can electronically file their federal and state income tax returns through our electronic filing service. Other services offered include audit defense and audit support. Our online tax preparation, filing, and other services were offered through the websites and mobile apps of thousands of financial institutions, electronic retailers, and other online merchants. Financial institutions can offer our online tax preparation and filing services to their customers through a link to TurboTax Online.\nCredit Karma\nOur Credit Karma segment provides consumers with a financial platform that propels them forward wherever they are on their financial journey, enabling them to understand their financial picture, make smart financial decisions, and stick to their financial plan. The platform offers a number of services to our members, many at no charge: access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit report dispute, tools to help understand net worth and make financial progress, and personalized recommendations of credit card, loan, and insurance products. Credit Karma Money offers members online savings and checking accounts through an FDIC member bank partner. Credit Karma Money also provides tools to help members improve their credit scores. To provide services to our members, Credit Karma works with a variety of partners, including credit bureaus, banks, credit card issuers, insurance carriers, and other financial institutions and lending partners.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nAdditionally, Credit Karma leverages Lightbox, a first-of-its-kind enterprise platform which allows lenders to leverage thousands of de-identified data points from Credit Karma members to help provide our members with greater certainty that they will be approved if they apply for a financial product.\nProTax\nOur ProTax segment includes our professional tax offerings and serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings consist of Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada. These offerings enable accountants to accurately and efficiently complete and electronically file a full range of consumer, small business, and commercial federal and state tax returns. Lacerte is designed for full-service, year-round accounting firms who handle more complex returns. ProSeries is designed for year-round tax practices handling moderately complex tax returns. ProConnect Tax Online is our cloud-based solution, which is designed for full-service, year-round practices who prepare all forms of consumer and small business returns and integrates with our QuickBooks Online offerings. ProFile is our Canadian desktop tax offering, which serves year-round full-service accounting firms for both consumer and business tax returns. ProTax Online is our Canadian cloud-based tax solution, which is designed for full-service, year-round practices who prepare all forms of consumer and business tax returns, and is integrated into QuickBooks Online Accountant to provide seamless integration of data across books and tax through our Workpapers solution. Our Tax Advisor offering leverages AI and information generated from our ProConnect Tax Online and Lacerte offerings to enable year-round tax planning services and communicate tax savings strategies to clients. We also offer a variety of tax-related services that complement the tax return preparation process, including year-round document storage, collaboration services, e-signature, and bank products, and additional capabilities such as fixed asset management, desktop hosting, and third-party solutions for practice management for some of our U.S. tax offerings.\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nThe markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Continuous investment is required to innovate and develop new products and services, as well as enhance existing offerings to be successful in these markets. Our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy.\nWe develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties, and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy.\nOur online offerings have rapid development cycles, while our traditional desktop software products tend to have predictable development cycles and regular product release cycles. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project.\nWe continue to make substantial investments in research and development, and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by AI and other advanced technologies. We continue to focus on developing new products and services, including global offerings, and significant research and development efforts for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings.\nSEASONALITY\nOur Consumer and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.\nWe expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProTax businesses to continue to have a material impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nMARKETING, SALES, AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS\nMarkets\nOur primary customers are consumers and small and mid-market businesses. We also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants, who are key partners to help us reach small and mid-market business customers. We partner with financial institutions and other partners, who we connect with consumers on our platform. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. The widespread usage of mobile devices and social media, and the evolution of AI, have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.\nReal-time, personalized online shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, and other changes in the way we do business.\nMarketing Programs\nWe use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of the Intuit brand and our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include offline marketing such as TV and radio advertising; digital marketing such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; email marketing; in-product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services; public relations; sponsorships; podcast marketing; mobile marketing; and retail marketing. Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross-sell additional offerings.\nSales and Distribution Channels\nDirect Sales Channel. We offer our products and services directly through our websites, apps, and call centers. Direct online sales are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase decisions based on content provided on our websites, or via other online content and word-of-mouth recommendations. For many of our products, assisted sales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers who want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on accountants, bookkeepers, and marketing professionals, and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our small business and professional tax solutions. For mid-market businesses, we have implemented and expanded our omnichannel go-to-market strategy by diversifying and growing our direct sales teams.\nMulti-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. Our customers primarily research products and services online. Many customers buy and use our products and services entirely online. Some research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel shop-and-buy model. We also focus on cross-selling complementary Intuit and third-party offerings online and in-product.\nMobile Application Stores. We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices.\nPartner and Other Channels. We offer many of our products and services through partners and other channels, including value-added resellers, technology partners with complimentary platforms, accountants, bookkeepers, and marketing professionals, and professional service providers who help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. These partners combine our products and services with marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. We also sell our QuickBooks Online and TurboTax Desktop offerings at retail locations across the United States and Canada and on retailer websites. Additionally, we sell our QuickBooks Enterprise software on retailer websites. In Canada, we also rely on distributors who sell products into the retail channel.\nCOMPETITION\nWe face intense competition in all of our businesses in all aspects across all markets for our products and services, which are rapidly evolving, fragmented, and have complex interdependencies with many businesses. Competitive pressures in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years, and the marketing and distribution channels continue to evolve. We expect these trends to continue. Our competitors may introduce superior products and services, successfully use and deploy new technologies such as AI that may reduce customer demand for our products or services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing, and other resources, have greater brand recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers, advertise aggressively, or beat us to market with new products and services.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe competitive landscape is also constantly evolving as we expand into new market segments and extend our capabilities, new companies emerge, and existing companies expand their capabilities (either directly or through acquisitions or partnerships) to include the markets in which we operate. Given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global financial technology company and the customer problems that we aim to solve, we compete with offerings from a variety of organizations across a range of industries, including large global companies, smaller geographically focused companies, startups, and professional services. Organizations that offer or provide access to offerings that we may compete with include:\n\u2022business software providers, such as those that provide accounting, business management and financial software, marketing automation, customer relationship management, inventory management, payroll and employee management;\n\u2022private and publicly-funded tax preparation and filing service providers;\n\u2022accounting, consulting, and tax firms;\n\u2022companies and banks that provide payments services, including merchant payment processing, checking, bill pay, savings, loans, point of sale devices, and small business financing;\n\u2022companies that provide personal finance management products and tools, including access to credit scores, credit and identity monitoring, credit-building tools, and tools to help understand net worth and make financial progress;\n\u2022companies that provide a marketplace of consumer financial offerings;\n\u2022financial institutions;\n\u2022credit bureaus; and\n\u2022large platform companies that could develop competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face.\nWe believe our most important competitive factors are our innovation and technology capabilities, functionality, ease of use, and security of our offerings, the integration of our offerings with each other and third-party offerings, brand recognition and reputation, quality of support, and cost. We believe that we compete favorably based on these factors and our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance.\nCUSTOMER SUCCESS\nFor many of our offerings, we provide support through channels including telephone, email, online and video chat, text messaging, our customer support websites, self-help assets embedded in our products, and online communities where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other.\nWe also provide access to experts, through our TurboTax and QuickBooks Live offerings, who provide tax advice, tax preparation, and bookkeeping services.\nOur customer success staff predominantly consists of Intuit-employed and outsourced experts. We supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch. We augment the services we provide with outsourced partnerships domestically and internationally. Most of our internationally outsourced small business customer success personnel are currently located in the Philippines and Portugal.\nWe also source staff through our Prosperity Hub program, which is designed to spark economic prosperity in underserved communities. One part of this program is our socially responsible sourcing model, where we both directly and through customer success partner-employers, hire, train, and retain workers who deliver support and services for our customers.\nSelf-help information is offered for free in-product and on our support websites for many of our offerings. Support alternatives and fees vary by product. For example, some product subscriptions receive 24x7 support and additional contact channel options.\nMANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION\nOnline Products and Services\nOur online offerings include QuickBooks Online, online payroll services, merchant payment processing and bill pay services, Mailchimp\u2019s marketing automation and customer relationship management offerings, TurboTax Online, ProConnect Tax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, and Credit Karma offerings. We use public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform for most of our systems, networks, and databases used to operate these online offerings.\nDesktop Software and Supplies\nAn increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software, however, a portion of our customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media. The key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs (CDs), printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final products. When physical product is ordered, we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order, and backlog is minimal.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER AND WORKFORCE INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS\nWe are stewards of our customers\u2019 data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting, using, and protecting such information. As we believe strongly in being good stewards of our customers\u2019 data, we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that govern our use, sharing, and protection of customers\u2019 personal information, including, for example, laws with respect to financial services and the handling of tax data. We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and members of our workforce are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them with the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to inform public policy for privacy and security.\nWe use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information that customers and members of our workforce give to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration. We use technical, logical, and procedural measures, which are designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of customer information. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information to us, such as credit card information or tax return data through one of our websites or products, we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us, and when we store it at rest. We routinely patch our systems with security updates and we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products, as well as internally developed security procedures and practices.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations that affect how we operate. For example, our Consumer and ProTax segments are subject to federal, state, and international government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. Our Small Business & Self-Employed segment offers products and services to small and mid-market businesses and consumers, such as payroll, payments, and other financial service offerings, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. Our Credit Karma segment offers personal finance products and services to consumers, such as recommendations of credit card, loan, and insurance products and access to credit scores and reports, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. For additional information regarding the government regulations to which we are subject, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, including without limitation the risks under \u201cLegal and Compliance Risks.\u201d\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings. We protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms, including copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, we regularly file applications for patents, copyrights, and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to Intuit\u2019s overall competitive advantage, although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time. We also have a number of registered trademarks that include Intuit, QuickBooks, Lacerte, TurboTax, QB, ProSeries, ProConnect, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp. We have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.\nAlthough our portfolio of patents is growing, the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. In addition, third parties have asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us and our customers. These claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, third-party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nWe consider our employees one of our four True North key stakeholders because they help us deliver for our customers, our shareholders, and the communities we serve. As of July 31, 2024, we had approximately 18,800 employees in 8 countries. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about the restructuring plan announced in July 2024. During fiscal 2024, we employed on average approximately 10,800 seasonal employees from January to April primarily to support our Consumer segment customers during the peak of tax season. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce in all areas of our business.\nIntuit\u2019s overall workforce development strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People & Places Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight with respect to company-wide organization and talent assessment, employee recruitment,\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nengagement and retention, leadership development, management depth and strength assessment, workplace environment and culture, employee health and safety, and pay equity.\nCulture and Values\nIn order to deliver on our mission to power prosperity around the world, we are guided by our company values as we strive to create a culture where employees can do the best work of their lives. Our values and culture are woven into our hiring and retention practices and are foundational to our ability to attract, retain, and advance top diverse talent.\n\u2022Our value of Integrity Without Compromise means valuing trust above all else, speaking the truth, and doing the right thing even when no one is looking.\n\u2022Our value of Courage means being bold and fearless in how we think and act, holding a high bar for performance, and valuing speed, with a bias for learning and action.\n\u2022Our value of Customer Obsession means falling in love with our customers\u2019 problems and delivering solutions that delight our customers.\n\u2022Our value of Stronger Together means championing diversity, inclusion, and a respectful environment, thriving on diverse voices to challenge and inform decisions and delivering exceptional work so others can count on us.\n\u2022Our value of We Care and Give Back means we strive to be stewards of the future, strengthen the communities around us, and give everyone the opportunity to prosper. We provide eligible full-time employees paid time off that can be used to do volunteer work during normal work hours for vetted non-profits and donation matching up to an annual limit.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nAt the foundation of our culture is a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). We believe that diversity is a fact, but treating people equitably and inclusively is a choice we make. To deliver for our customers, we seek to foster a workforce that is as diverse as the communities we serve. We are committed to creating a culture that reflects our values and helps achieve our mission of powering prosperity around the world. Our Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer (CDEIO) leads a dedicated and specialized team in our DEI efforts. Our Compensation and Organizational Development Committee oversees Intuit\u2019s DEI initiatives in support of organizational development. Intuit\u2019s strategy is operationalized through the following elements:\n\u2022Goals and transparency: We have set goals that focus on our long-term vision of a workforce that reflects the diversity of our customers. These goals are aspirational and we do not set quotas or make employment decisions based on any legally protected characteristics. Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report (DEI Report) can be found at www.intuit.com/company/diversity/ and discloses our goals, progress on our goals, and certain diversity statistics of our workforce. The contents of the DEI Report are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\n\u2022Recruiting: Intuit has established practices to drive diversity, equity, and inclusion across our hiring practices, programs, and strategies. We have also invested in external partnerships to better engage with diverse talent and communities.\n\u2022Equity learning and development: Senior leaders are offered DEI workshops, including training on racial equity. We have manager and employee training and resources on topics such as unconscious bias, racial equity, and leading inclusively and a guide for managers on encouraging inclusive conversations.\n\u2022Equitable talent practices: We are committed to equitable talent practices that include those designed to ensure equitable pay. We continuously examine our performance evaluation practices, including promoting awareness of bias by managers and improving practices to ensure equal opportunity for high-performing employees to be promoted.\n\u2022Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): Intuit has established employee resource groups (ERGs) that provide a foundation for a workplace culture that is supportive, educational, and collaborative. Intuit ERGs offer a sense of community and give employees the chance to learn from role models, peers, and experts, all while aligning with our organization\u2019s overall vision. They also actively volunteer in their communities, which is an important part of their charters.\nDeveloping Talent and Training\nWe are committed to creating a high-performance culture that consistently delivers for our customers, shareholders, and communities while providing an experience for our workforce that values leadership, innovation, and collaboration. We promote the development of all of our employees and provide employees with access to learning plans based on their needs and interests and the resources they need to grow, thrive, and reinvent themselves over time. We offer learning programs throughout the employee lifecycle, beginning with onboarding and the first year at Intuit, and continuing with ongoing career growth programs.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nWe are also invested in growing the capabilities of our managers and developing the leadership skills of our executives. Our teams design programs and resources, such as the Intuit Leadership Playbook, focused on leading with a clear vision, building a high-performance culture, and driving winning results for all of our stakeholders.\nAll full-time employees have access to opportunities to develop and learn through company-sponsored learning paths and online courses on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to accelerating velocity in support of an employee\u2019s ability to adapt to any work environment. We also offer multiple mentorship programs that match employees with a mentor who can support their career development.\nEmployees set goals and measure progress through our goal setting tool and have opportunities to focus on growth both during performance assessment conversations and ongoing regular check-ins.\nEmployee Listening and Engagement\nListening and responding to our employees is at the core of our work. We value employee feedback and we leverage it to continuously improve the employee experience. We regularly collect, analyze, measure, and share insights about the sentiment of our workforce through multiple channels, including surveys, town halls with senior leadership, and other touchpoints, which helps to guide the work we do to support our employees.\nTotal Rewards\nOur compensation philosophy aims to attract and retain top talent for today and the future. Intuit\u2019s total target compensation includes base pay, a range of incentive plans that vary based on role, and stock-based awards - all set at market-competitive levels. Incentive compensation plans are part of our pay-for-performance philosophy, including close alignment with Company performance that rewards top performers. Most employees are eligible for stock-based awards, which allows the majority of our employees to share in the Company\u2019s success.\nWe also offer eligible employees a broad range of competitive benefits designed to protect and enhance their health, financial future, and overall well-being. These programs include health care, free mental health counseling and resources, retirement benefits, life and family support programs, and paid time off, including annual paid recharge days and family and parental leave.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following table shows Intuit\u2019s executive officers and their areas of responsibility as of July 31, 2024.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur businesses routinely encounter and address risks, many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. Below, we describe significant factors, events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky, categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic, operational, legal and compliance, and financial risks. The following events and consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, reputation and credit rating, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. We could also be affected by other events, factors or uncertainties that are presently unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our business. These risks may be amplified by the effects of global developments and conditions or events, including macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, which have caused significant global economic instability and uncertainty.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nWe face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results.\nWe face intense competition in all of our businesses, and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging start-ups. Our competitors may introduce superior products and services, successfully use and deploy new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) that may reduce customer demand for our products or services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing and other resources, have greater name recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services. In addition, we face competition from existing companies with large established consumer user bases and broad-based platforms, who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers, including small businesses, tax and personal financial management customers.\nWe also face competition from companies with a variety of business models and monetization strategies, including increased competition from providers of free and low cost offerings, particularly in our tax, accounting, payments and consumer finance platform businesses. We have also introduced free offerings in several categories, but we may not be able to attract and retain customers as effectively as our competitors with different business models. In addition, other providers of free offerings may provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for our products and services may elect to use our competitors\u2019 free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers.\nOur consumer tax business also faces significant, increasing competition from the public sector, where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities implementing revenue-raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense. These or similar programs have been and may continue to be introduced or expanded in the future, which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue. For example, the IRS has stated that it will make a free direct filing system, which it piloted in 2024, a permanent option in 2025 and will explore ways to expand eligibility for the program, including partnering with more states. Additionally, the legacy IRS Free File Program enables the IRS to offer free commercial tax software directly to qualifying taxpayers, and taxpayer adoption of this program could expand with increased awareness of and government support for the program.\nThrough these or other programs, federal and state governments are or could become publicly funded direct competitors of the U.S. tax services industry and of Intuit. Government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications on us.\nFuture revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully extend our platform, introduce new and enhanced products, features, services and business models.\nWe operate in industries that are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. To meet the evolving needs and expectations of our customers and partners and attract and retain top technical talent, we must continue to innovate, develop and extend our platform, introduce new products and features, and enhance our ability to solve customer problems with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence. If we are not able to do this successfully, we may face a competitive disadvantage. We have and will continue to devote significant resources to continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. There can be no assurance that we or our customers will realize the expected benefits from these investments. Legislation or regulatory changes in these areas may mandate changes in our products that make them less attractive to users and hinder our ability to leverage emerging technologies and build out our platform capabilities.\nOur consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services, including customers who use our free consumer tax products and whose tax scenarios evolve in subsequent years to require paid services. Encouraging customers to continue using our products in successive years can become more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value. As we continue to introduce and expand our new business models our customers may not perceive value in the additional benefits and services we offer and may choose not to pay for those additional benefits or we\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nmay be unsuccessful in increasing customer adoption of these offerings or our risk profile may change, resulting in loss of revenue.\nWhen customers consent to the use of their data across our platform, we work to provide additional benefits to them through our existing offerings and the creation of new products and services. The growth of our business depends, in part, on our ability to successfully provide customers value in this way. If we are unable to clearly demonstrate the value of these new or upgraded products or services, our ability to build new data-driven products and services may be limited and our revenues may be harmed.\nIn some cases, we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. We have also invested, and in the future, expect to invest in new business models, technologies, geographies, strategies and initiatives. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including a rapidly changing regulatory environment, distraction of management from current operations, expenses associated with the initiatives, inadequate return on investments, and social or ethical scrutiny. Because these new initiatives are inherently risky, they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition, operating results, or reputation.\nWe rely on intellectual property in our products and services.\nMany of our products and services include our own intellectual property, as well as the intellectual property of third parties, which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time. We may not be able to obtain licenses to these third-party technologies or content on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services, we may not be able to provide the affected offerings, and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted, which may in turn harm our future financial results, damage our brand, and result in customer loss. Also, we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third-party intellectual property incorporated in our offerings, including through our use of AI. Although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement, pending claims require us to use significant resources, require management attention and could result in loss of customers.\nSome of our offerings include third-party software that is licensed under \u201copen source\u201d licenses, some of which may include a requirement that, under certain circumstances, we make available, or grant licenses to, any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software. Although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks, we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and, if not properly addressed, may harm our business.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. The efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective. In addition, there is uncertainty about the validity and enforceability of intellectual property rights that may result from our use of generative AI. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our brand, and our ability to compete.\nPolicing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection. We frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces. Although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy, we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses.\nOur business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.\nDeveloping and maintaining awareness of our brands and platform strategy is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers and expanding our business with existing customers. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events or activities attributed to us, members of our workforce, agents, third parties we rely on, or our users, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Perceived social harm or unfairness of outcomes relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. Our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy products and services, as well as our ability to protect and use our customers\u2019 data in a manner that meets their expectations. In addition, a security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers\u2019 sensitive data could cause material reputational harm. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products or services and thus have an\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nadverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price.\nOur aspirations and disclosures related to environment, social, and governance (ESG) matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\nWe have public ESG commitments, including our goals to increase the diversity of our workforce, create and prepare individuals for jobs and have a positive impact on the climate. Our ability to achieve these goals is subject to numerous risks that may be outside of our control, including our ability to recruit, develop and retain talent, the evolving ESG regulatory requirements, and the ability of our suppliers to meet our sustainability, diversity and other standards. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve and we may not be able to implement new and changing standards in ways that meet the expectations of all of our stakeholders. Our failure or perceived failure to achieve our ESG goals or maintain ESG practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities. Our reputation also may be harmed by negative perceptions that our customers, employees and other stakeholders may have about our action or inaction on social, ethical, or political issues.\nOur acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products, technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction, both in and outside the United States. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology, data assets and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures;\n\u2022inability to realize synergies or anticipated benefits within the expected time frame or at all;\n\u2022disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022challenges retaining the key employees, customers, resellers and other business partners of the acquired operation;\n\u2022the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards or with regulatory requirements, and may require significant time and resources to align or rectify;\n\u2022unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, security policies, standards, and practices, intellectual property issues and legal contingencies;\n\u2022failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;\n\u2022risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\n\u2022in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and\n\u2022to the extent we use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes, our interest expense and leverage will increase significantly, and to the extent we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership and earnings per share will be diluted.\nWe have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms;\n\u2022failure to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to buyers;\n\u2022requirements that we retain or indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations;\n\u2022the possibility that we will become subject to third-party claims arising out of such divestiture;\n\u2022challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property, systems and data to be divested from the intellectual property, systems and data that we wish to retain;\n\u2022inability to reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business;\n\u2022challenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture;\n\u2022disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022loss of key employees who leave us as a result of a divestiture; and\n\u2022if customers or partners of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, or the new owners do not handle the customer data with the same level of care, our other businesses may be adversely\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\naffected, to the extent that these customers or partners also purchase other products offered by us or otherwise conduct business with our retained business.\nIn addition, any acquisition or divestiture that we announce may not be completed if closing conditions are not satisfied. Evolving regulatory expectations may make it more challenging to obtain any required regulatory approval. Because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. In particular, if we are unable to successfully operate together with any company that we acquire to achieve shared growth opportunities or combine reporting or other processes within the expected time frame or at all, there may be a material and adverse effect on the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition, and we could experience additional costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, adverse changes in market conditions and other factors, including those listed above, may cause an acquisition to be dilutive to Intuit\u2019s operating earnings per share for a period of time. Any dilution of our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share could cause the price of shares of Intuit Common Stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nSecurity incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers\u2019 data, or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.\nWe host, collect, use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and workforce data, including credit card information, tax return information, bank account numbers, credit report information, login credentials and passwords, personal and business financial data and transactions data, social security numbers and payroll information, as well as our confidential, nonpublic business information. Although we expend significant resources to implement security protections designed to shield this data against potential theft and security incidents, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nOur technologies, systems, and networks have been subject to, and are increasingly likely to continue to be the target of, cyberattacks, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, worms, social engineering, malicious software programs, insider threats, denial-of-service attacks and other cybersecurity threats that have in the past, and could in the future, result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, use, loss or destruction of sensitive and personal data of our customers and our workforce, or Intuit's sensitive business data or cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our data, software, and systems. Cybersecurity incidents can be caused by malicious third parties, acting alone or in groups, or more sophisticated organizations, including nation-states or state-sponsored organizations, and the risks could be elevated in connection with significant armed conflicts, acts of war or terrorism. Customers who fail to update their systems, continue to run software that we no longer support, fail to install security patches on a timely basis or inadequately use security controls create vulnerabilities and make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products, and there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that make it susceptible to cyberattacks. In addition, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information change frequently and, as technologies like AI develop rapidly, malicious third parties are using these technologies to create new sophisticated attack methods that are increasingly automated, targeted and coordinated and more difficult to defend against. We have and may in the future be a more frequent target of cyberattacks because cyber-criminals tend to focus their efforts on well-known offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive personal or financial information.\nFurther, the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to our products and our customers\u2019 account data. Malicious third parties have in the past, and may in the future, be able to fraudulently induce members of our workforce, customers, vendors, partners, or users by social engineering means, such as email phishing, to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers or our workforce. Accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. Unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software. Inadvertent exposure of data or access to our systems may also be caused by members of our workforce, including by their error or use of AI.\nCriminals may also use stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems to gain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data. We have experienced such instances in the past and as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases, generally, we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems through the use of stolen identity information of our customers or our workforce in the future. Further, our customers may choose to use the same login credentials across multiple products and services unrelated to our products. Such customers\u2019 login credentials may be stolen from products offered by third-party service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products, which could result in disclosure of confidential information. In addition, our hybrid workplace model, where our workforce spends a portion of their time working remotely, increases the potential attack surfaces and introduces operational complexity that exacerbates our security-related risks.\nFurther, because we have created an ecosystem where customers can have one identity across multiple Intuit products, a security incident may give access to increased amounts of customer data. From time to time, we detect, or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected, actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our infrastructure, our software or third-party software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information. The existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity, even if they do not result in a security breach, may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings. Such perceived vulnerabilities could also seriously harm our business by\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\ntarnishing our reputation and brand and limiting the adoption of our products and services and could cause our stock price to decline. In some cases, such vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which could exacerbate the risk of a security incident and the related effects on our businesses.\nWhile we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities described herein. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in disclosure of confidential information, loss of customer confidence in our products, possible litigation, material harm to our reputation and financial condition, disruption of our or our customers\u2019 business operations, and a decline in our stock price.\nAdditionally, Credit Karma is subject to an order issued in 2014 by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that, among other things, requires maintenance of a comprehensive security program relating to the development and management of new and existing products and services and biennial independent security assessments for 20 years from the date of the order. Credit Karma\u2019s failure to fulfill the requirements of the FTC\u2019s order could result in fines, penalties, enforcement inquiries, investigations and claims, and negatively impact our business and reputation.\nA cybersecurity incident affecting the third parties we rely on could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and significantly damage our reputation.\nWe depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners who are critical to our business. We or our customers may grant access to customer data to these third parties to help deliver customer benefits, or to host certain of our and our customers' sensitive and personal data. In addition, we share sensitive, nonpublic business information (including, for example, materials relating to financial, business and legal strategies) with other vendors in the ordinary course of business.\nWhile we conduct background checks of our workforce, conduct reviews of partners, developers and vendors and use commercially available technologies to limit access to systems and data, it is possible that malicious third parties may misrepresent their intended use of data or may circumvent our controls, resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customer or workforce data. Further, while we conduct due diligence on the security and business controls of our third-party partners, we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures. Malicious third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or workforce information and data. In addition, malicious actors may attempt to use the information technology supply chain to compromise our systems by, for example, introducing malware through software updates. This risk is exacerbated with the advancement of technologies like AI, which malicious third parties are using to create new, sophisticated and more frequent attacks on our third-party partners.\nA security incident involving third parties we rely on may have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including disclosure of sensitive customer or workforce data, or confidential or competitively sensitive information regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data; make our products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity; cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems; result in possible litigation, fines, penalties and damages; result in loss of customer confidence; cause material harm to our reputation and brands; lead to further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies; cause adverse financial condition; and result in a reduced stock price.\nConcerns about the current cybersecurity environment, generally, could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation.\nThe continued occurrence of cybersecurity incidents affecting governments, businesses and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cybersecurity incidents are becoming increasingly common. If the global cybersecurity environment worsens, and there are increased instances of security breaches of third-party offerings where consumers\u2019 data and sensitive information is compromised, consumers may be less willing to use online offerings, particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data. Additionally, political uncertainty and military actions may subject us and our service providers to heightened risks of security incidents. In addition, the increased availability of data obtained as a result of cybersecurity incidents affecting third-party offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity. Even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents, any such incident could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether.\nIf we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties, we may suffer losses, which may be substantial, and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed.\nMany of the industries in which we operate have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties, and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated. We have been and may from time to time become targeted by such malicious third parties engaging in fraudulent activities. Any such fraudulent activities may adversely impact our tax, payroll, payments, lending, marketing automation and personal financial management businesses, and the risk is heightened when our workforce is working remotely under our hybrid work model. In addition to any losses that may result from such fraud, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity may seriously harm our business and damage our brand. If we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity, governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer the affected services, or these services\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nmay otherwise be adversely impacted, which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers\u2019 tax returns electronically, resulting in a significant adverse impact on our business, earnings, and revenue. As fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated, our fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate. Accordingly, we have implemented and may continue to implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products. These control mechanisms could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings.\nIf we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, our business may be harmed.\nOur operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis, especially in our money and personal financial management businesses. Despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately, it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud. The likelihood of any such error or misappropriation is magnified as we increase the volume and speed of the transactions we process. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes, or if there is an error in our products, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our reputation, the willingness of customers to use our products, and our financial results. In our payments processing service business, if a disputed transaction between a merchant and its customer is not resolved in favor of the merchant, we may be required to pay those amounts to the payment or credit card network and these payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves established to make such payments.\nBusiness interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. As we continue to grow our online services, we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our external service providers, including, for example, third-party Internet-based or cloud computing services. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. We have designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by public cloud providers. If any public cloud service that we use is unavailable to us for any reason, our customers may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features, which could significantly impact our operations, business, and financial results.\nFailure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers, may result in interruptions in our service and loss of data or processing capabilities, all of which may cause a loss in customers, refunds of product fees, material harm to our reputation and operating results.\nOur tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods. We face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods when we have historically derived a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses. Any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season, particularly during a peak period, could result in significantly decreased revenue, lost customers, unexpected refunds of customer charges, negative publicity and increased operating costs, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests and host certain online activities. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. Our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our high-availability capabilities are costly, and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations.\nOur business operations, information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, effects of climate change, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malware, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, public health emergencies and other events beyond our control. For example, we operate under a hybrid workplace model where our workforce spends a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working remotely. This model has introduced risks of disruptions to our operations, which may impair our ability to perform critical functions or could make it considerably more difficult to develop, enhance and support our products and services.\nIn addition, since our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults, our recovery in the event of a major earthquake or other catastrophic event may require us to expend significant time and resources and may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Further, the adverse effects of any such adverse event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event. In the event of a major natural or man-made disaster, our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nWe regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms. Should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on our network infrastructure, data hosting, public cloud and software-as-a-service providers, and internal technology systems for many of our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting and financial reporting activities. We are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs, as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers. If we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture, we may experience outages, defects or other performance problems, and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive. Such improvements and upgrades are often complex, costly and time consuming. In addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems. Unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages, disruption in our business operations, loss of revenue or damage to our reputation.\nIf we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third-party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, manage and maintain new and existing relationships with third-party partners. We rely on various third-party partners, including software and service providers, platforms, suppliers, credit reporting bureaus, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, accountants, contractors, financial institutions, core processors, licensing partners and development partners, among others, in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business. Credit Karma generates revenue from its relationships with financial institution and other partners, which are subject to particular risks that affect their willingness to offer their products on Credit Karma's platform, such as adverse economic conditions, evolving limitations on their capacity to offer products on the platform, the introduction of competing products on their platforms, and an increasing complexity in the regulatory environment. We also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities, equipment, power systems and infrastructure. In certain instances, these third-party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party\u2019s products or services into, or with, our offerings and/or the general availability of such third party\u2019s products and services. In addition, there may be few or no alternative third-party providers or vendors in the market. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third-party contractors engaged to help us operate our business.\nAdditionally, the business operations of our third-party partners and the third-party partners who support them have been and could continue to be disrupted, including as a result of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and global health crises, such as pandemics and endemics. If our third-party partners are unable to help us operate our business or prevent us from delivering critical services to our customers or accepting and fulfilling customer orders, our business and financial results may be negatively impacted. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products, services and technologies or to update their products, services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.\nIn particular, we have relationships with banks, credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers. If macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail, consolidate, stop providing certain services or institute cost-cutting efforts, or give rise to speculation relating to such events, we may be unable to offer those services to our customers, in which case our business and financial results may suffer. For example, if one of the counterparty financial institutions with whom we have significant deposits were to become insolvent, placed into receivership, or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover our assets from such counterparty may be limited, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we have strict standards for our suppliers and business partners to comply with the law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data use and security, environmental compliance, intellectual property licensing and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements, we cannot control their day-to-day practices. Any violation of laws or implementation of practices regarded as unethical could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation.\nWe increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings. Although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers, the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure, terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers. Any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results.\nCompetition for our key employees is intense and we may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our strategic objectives.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled employees, including members of our executive team, and those in technical and other key positions. Experienced individuals with skill sets in software as a service,\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nfinancial technology, mobile technologies, data science, artificial intelligence and data security are in high demand and we have faced and will continue to face intense competition globally to attract and retain a diverse workforce with these and other skills that are critical to our success. This is especially the case in California and India where a significant number of our employees are located. The compensation and incentives we have available to attract, retain and motivate employees may not meet the expectations of current and prospective employees as the competition for talent intensifies. For example, our equity awards may become less effective if our stock price decreases or increases at a slower rate than our talent competitors. In addition, our ability to issue significant additional equity to attract or retain employees may be limited by the risks of dilution to our existing stockholders and the related increase in our expenses. We may experience higher compensation costs to retain and recruit senior management and highly-skilled employees that may not be offset by improved productivity or revenue. Other factors may make it more challenging for us to continue to successfully attract, retain and develop key employees. For example, current and prospective employees may seek new or different opportunities based on mobility, location flexibility in our hybrid work model, achieving our publicly stated workforce diversity aspirations or other reputational factors.\nUncertainty in the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence in our platform and products and by our customers may result in harm to our business and reputation.\nWe continue to build and invest in systems and tools that incorporate AI-based technologies, including generative AI for customers, experts, and our workforce. We also use third parties to support this work. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, uncertainties, and challenges that could adversely impact our business. The development, adoption, and use for generative AI technologies are still in their early stages, and ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Intuit or third-party developers or vendors could result in unintended consequences. For example, AI algorithms that we use may be flawed or may be based on datasets that are biased or insufficient. In addition, any latency, disruption, or failure in our AI systems or infrastructure could result in delays or errors in our offerings. Developing, testing, and deploying resource-intensive AI systems may require additional investment and increase our costs. There also may be real or perceived social harm, unfairness, or other outcomes that undermine public confidence in the use and deployment of AI. In addition, third parties may deploy AI technologies in a manner that reduces customer demand for our products and services. Any of the foregoing may result in decreased demand for our products or harm to our business, results of operations or reputation.\nThe legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain including in the areas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. In addition, there is uncertainty around the validity and enforceability of intellectual property rights related to our use, development, and deployment of AI. Compliance with new or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and may limit our ability to develop, deploy or use AI technologies. Failure to appropriately respond to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and reputational harm.\nIf we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays in product launches, it may harm our revenue, earnings and reputation.\nOur customers rely on the accuracy of our offerings. All of our tax products and many of our non-tax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable, ambiguous, and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline. Due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate, our products may contain errors that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations. The complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features, functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect. When we encounter problems, we may be required to modify our code, work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers, assist customers with amendments, distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels. If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release, it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed. Any major defects, launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue, negative publicity, customer and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, and increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement costs, legal fees or other payments, including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products. For example, an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers, including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability. While our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products, such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed. This could also affect our reputation, the willingness of customers to use our products, and our financial results. Further, as we develop our platform to connect people to experts, such as connecting TurboTax customers with tax experts through our TurboTax Live offering, or connecting QuickBooks customers with bookkeepers through our QuickBooks Live offering, we face the risk that these experts may provide advice that is erroneous, ineffective or otherwise unsuitable. Any such deficiency in the advice given by these experts may cause harm to our customers, a loss of customer confidence in our offerings or harm to our reputation or financial results. Moreover, as we continue to incorporate emerging technologies, like AI, into our offerings, they may not function as designed or have unintended\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nconsequences, any of which could subject us to new or enhanced competitive harm, legal liability, regulatory scrutiny or reputational harm.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022different or more restrictive privacy, data protection, data localization, and other laws that could require us to make changes to our products, services and operations, such as mandating that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country;\n\u2022difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u2022stringent local labor laws and regulations;\n\u2022credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022profit repatriation restrictions, and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u2022geopolitical events, including natural disasters or severe weather events (including those caused or exacerbated by climate change), acts of war and terrorism (including the conflict in the Middle East) and any related military, political or economic responses, and public health emergencies, including divergent governmental responses thereto affecting the jurisdictions in which we operate or maintain a workforce or facilities;\n\u2022compliance with sanctions and import or export regulations, including those arising from the Russia-Ukraine war;\n\u2022compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and laws and regulations of other jurisdictions prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\n\u2022antitrust and competition regulations;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax developments;\n\u2022economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt;\n\u2022trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;\n\u2022political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\n\u2022risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws.\nViolations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions or sanctions against us, our officers or our broader workforce, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, we cannot be sure that our workforce, contractors and agents are in compliance with our policies. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations that are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Any of our primary workplace locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, our offices globally have historically experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, cold waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees to the extent they work from home. Changing market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our third-party suppliers and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. We also expect to face increasing regulatory requirements and regulatory scrutiny related to climate matters, resulting in higher associated compliance costs. Additionally, failure to uphold, meet or make timely forward progress against our public commitments and goals related to climate action could adversely affect our reputation with suppliers and customers, financial performance or ability to recruit and retain talent.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nIncreasing and changing regulation of our businesses may adversely affect our ability to operate or harm our operating results.\nWe are subject to an increasing number of local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and rules and standards. These relate to, without limitation, labor, advertising and marketing, tax, financial services, artificial intelligence, data privacy and security, electronic funds transfer, money transmission, lending, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property ownership and infringement, import and export requirements, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, insurance, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, antitrust and competition, environmental, health and safety, and other regulated activities.\nThese laws and regulations are not consistent across jurisdictions and are subject to change and evolving interpretations, and we expect significant new regulations will affect emerging technologies, such as AI. As we expand our products and services and evolve our business models, we have, and may in the future, become subject to additional changing regulations and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Our ability to adopt emerging technologies, including AI, and to innovate for our customers and operate our business may be harmed by the uncertainty and complexity created by the regulatory environment. For example, in May 2024, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act (\u201cAI Act\u201d) that will regulate AI systems that affect individuals located in the EU. Compliance with the AI Act, and similar emerging laws, may add significant costs to our business and may require us to change certain business practices to comply. In addition, some of our offerings, such as our lending and payments products, require licenses to operate. Our inability to obtain or maintain a license, or to comply with current or new license requirements, may materially harm our ability to operate in specific jurisdictions or subject us to regulatory fines or penalties.\nThe tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments. New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, changes in the cybersecurity environment, litigation by the government or private entities, changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services. We may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory, legislative and other developments, and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities. In addition, if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws, we may become subject to lawsuits, penalties, and other liabilities that did not previously apply. We are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state-imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner.\nAny perceived or actual failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules could negatively impact our reputation and expose us to legal liability, fines, penalties, or require us to change our products or business operations. In addition, evolving laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or modify our compliance programs in order to continue operating our businesses. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our ability to operate and may harm our results of operations.\nComplex and evolving privacy and data protection regulations or changing customer expectations could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties or increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nRegulations related data privacy, cybersecurity, the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data, and the use of AI are evolving. Many jurisdictions in which we operate globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, data privacy legislation or regulations aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the collection, use, and retention of personal information by our offerings in the EU. In addition, in the absence of a unified federal privacy standard, a growing number of U.S. states have enacted or introduced data privacy laws and regulations. Several countries have established specific legal requirements for cross-border data transfers and governmental authorities and privacy advocates around the world continue to propose new regulatory actions concerning data protection. Moreover, several jurisdictions are considering regulatory frameworks for AI that implicate data protection laws.\nIn our efforts to meet the various data privacy regulations that apply to us, we have made and continue to make certain operational changes to our products, business practices, and use of certain third party tools and vendors. Additionally, customer sensitivity to privacy continues to increase and our privacy statements and practices may create additional customer expectations about the collection, use, and sharing of personal information.\nIn addition, the evolution of global privacy treaties and frameworks has created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity. For example, the judicial invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks that we relied on to transfer data has created additional compliance challenges for the transfer of EU personal data to the U.S. While the European Commission recently issued a decision that allows personal data to flow from the European Union to U.S. companies, the future of this framework is uncertain because it faces legal challenges in the European courts.\nEach of these privacy, security and data protection requirements could impose significant limitations on us, require changes to our business, require notification to customers or workers of a security incident, restrict our use or storage of personal\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\ninformation, limit our use of third-party tools and vendors, or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior that may make our business more costly, less efficient or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future products or services, which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results. Additionally, any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations, or failure to meet customer expectations could result in negative publicity or harm to our reputation and subject us to investigations, claims or other remedies, including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices, and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nWe are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings (including class action lawsuits), claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional proceedings, claims and inquiries may arise in the future. The number and significance of these proceedings, claims and inquiries may increase as our businesses evolve. Any proceedings, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be time consuming; result in costly litigation, damage awards, consent decrees, injunctive relief or increased costs of business; require us to change our business practices or products; require significant amounts of management time; result in diversion of significant operations resources; or otherwise harm our business and future financial results. For further information about specific litigation, see Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nThird parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.\nWe may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. We have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties. Some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers. These claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, require us to stop selling, delay shipping or redesign of our products, or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims made against us may harm our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.\nThe laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges, and there has been an increasing demand for repealing or limiting the protections afforded by these laws through either judicial decision or legislation. In spite of settled law in the U.S., claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. Where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the U.S., challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the U.S. These challenges in either U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers\u2019 misconduct and may further give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services. Certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services. Although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nThe results of operations of our tax business may fluctuate from period to period due to the seasonality of the business and other factors beyond our control.\nOur tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns. Revenue from income tax preparation products and services has historically been heavily concentrated from November through April, as the tax filing deadline for the IRS and many states is traditionally in April. This seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. In addition, unanticipated changes to federal and state tax filing deadlines may further exacerbate the impact of the seasonality.\nOur financial results from our tax offerings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of other factors, some of which may affect the timing of revenue recognition. These include the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions; changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services; changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix; changes in customer behavior; and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings. Other factors,\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nincluding unanticipated changes to the tax code or the administration of government programs and payments by tax authorities, may cause variations from year to year in the number of tax filers. Any of the foregoing could negatively impact the number of tax returns we prepare and file and the operating results of our tax business. Other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges. Any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.\nIf actual customer refunds for our offerings exceed the amount we have reserved, our future financial results may be harmed.\nLike many software companies, we refund customers for product returns and subscription and service cancellations. We establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds. We closely monitor this refund activity in an effort to maintain adequate reserves. In the past, customer refunds have not differed significantly from these reserves. However, if we experience actual customer refunds or an increase in risks of collecting customer payments that significantly exceed the amount we have reserved, it may result in lower net revenue.\nUnanticipated changes in our income tax rates or other indirect tax may affect our future financial results.\nOur future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in our stock price, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. There are several proposed changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax legislation and the ultimate enactment of any of them could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate. Foreign governments may enact tax laws, including in response to guidelines issued by international organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These continuous examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may harm our future financial results.\nAn increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly, or at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in material tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nAdverse global macroeconomic conditions could harm our business and financial condition.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, and perceptions or expectations about current or future conditions, such as volatility or distress in the financial markets, recession or inflationary pressures, slowing growth, rising interest rates, rising unemployment, rising consumer debt levels, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, government shutdowns and austerity programs could negatively affect our business and financial condition. These macroeconomic conditions or global events, such as political instability and war, have caused, and could, in the future, cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets, increased rates of default and bankruptcy, decreases in consumer and small business spending and other unforeseen consequences. It is difficult to predict the impact of such events on our partners, customers, members, or economic markets more broadly, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments and businesses in response to macroeconomic events, and the effectiveness of those actions. Additionally, adverse developments that affect financial institutions, such as bank failures, or concerns or speculation about similar events or risks, could lead to liquidity challenges and further instability in the financial markets, which may in turn cause third parties, including customers, to become unable to meet their obligations under various types of financial arrangements. Moreover, because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the U.S., economic conditions in the U.S. have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence. Macroeconomic conditions, and perceptions or expectations about current or future conditions, could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services, and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services. In addition, some financial institutions and other partners have decreased or suspended their activity on Credit Karma\u2019s platform and may continue to do so, and increased interest rates may make offers from Credit Karma\u2019s partners less attractive to Credit Karma's members. Members may decrease their engagement on the platform or their creditworthiness could be negatively impacted, reducing members' ability to qualify for credit cards and loans. Decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce payment processing volumes, causing reductions in our payments revenue. High unemployment and changes in the tax code and the government programs that are administered by tax authorities have caused, and could in the future cause, a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed, which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file. In addition, weakness in the end-user consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers. Adverse economic conditions may also increase the costs of operating our business, including vendor, supplier and workforce expenses. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets or increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity positions. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\ninterest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and negatively impact our future financial results.\nWe provide capital to small businesses, which exposes us to risk, and may cause us material financial or reputational harm.\nWe provide capital to qualified small businesses, which exposes us to the risk of our borrowers\u2019 inability to repay such loans. We have also entered into credit arrangements with financial institutions to obtain a portion of the capital we provide to qualified small businesses. Any termination or interruption in the financial institutions\u2019 ability to lend to us could interrupt our ability to provide capital to qualified small businesses. Further, our credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting, scoring and other models used to evaluate loan applications may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of our borrowers, or may be otherwise ineffective, resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans. It is also possible that loan applicants could provide false or incorrect information. Moreover, adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation and rising interest rates, have impacted and may continue to impact small businesses, which are disproportionately adversely affect by economic downturns, and may increase the likelihood that our borrowers are unable to repay their loans. If any of the foregoing events were to occur, our reputation, relationships with borrowers, collections of loans receivable and financial results could be harmed.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income.\nOur acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets, and impairment of goodwill. Total costs and expenses in these categories were $629 million in fiscal 2024; $646 million in fiscal 2023; and $556 million in fiscal 2022. Although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized, we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. At July 31, 2024, we had $13.8 billion in goodwill and $5.8 billion in net acquired intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet, both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future. New acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets, may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results.\nWe have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nAs of July 31, 2024, we had an aggregate of $6.0 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our senior unsecured notes, senior unsecured credit facility, and secured credit facilities. Under the agreements governing our indebtedness, we are permitted to incur additional debt. This debt, and any debt that we may incur in the future, may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required, among other things, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital, operating or investment expenditures. Such measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt.\nAdditionally, the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to comply with certain covenants. For example, our credit facilities restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes limit our ability to create liens on our and subsidiaries\u2019 assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or the noteholders, as applicable, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any or all of our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.\nUnder the terms of our 2020 Notes, we may be required to repurchase the notes for cash prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain changes of control that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the notes. The repayment obligations under the notes may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company. If we were required to pay the notes prior to their scheduled maturity, it could have a negative impact on our cash position and liquidity and impair our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nunder our unsecured revolving credit facility may increase. In addition, adverse economic conditions or any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may negatively impact the terms of any such financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nWe have a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Even if our stock repurchase program is fully implemented, it may not enhance long-term stockholder value. Also, the amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase programs may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, and the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value.\nOur stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or legal proceedings can cause changes in our stock price. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions, including the effects of a general slowdown in the global economy, inflationary pressures, pandemics and endemics, significant armed conflicts, acts of war and terrorism, and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes may cause volatility in our stock price. Moreover, inflationary pressures, pandemics and endemics, and significant armed conflicts, acts of war and terrorism have caused, and in the future may cause, increased volatility in the global financial markets and, in turn, our stock price. Further, any changes in the amounts or frequency of share repurchases or dividends may also adversely affect our stock price. A significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which may result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business.",

    "item_1C": "ITEM 1C - CYBERSECURITY\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\nWe host, collect, process, use, and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal data across an array of our own and third-party information systems. To help protect these systems and data, we have implemented a robust information security program that includes numerous administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. We strive to evolve our cyber defenses to help minimize impacts from cyber threats. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a cross-functional approach. This approach focuses on protecting business operations and preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data by preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats, as well as effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.\nOur information security program includes:\n\u2022Having designated information security personnel, led by our Chief Information Security and Fraud Prevention Officer (CISO), who has decades of relevant experience and has previously served as Chief Information Officer. The CISO is supported primarily by our Cybersecurity, Compliance, Risk, and Fraud Team (CyberCRAFT), which consists of approximately 490 professionals as of July 31, 2024. In addition to bringing their current expertise to their roles, CyberCRAFT professionals have the ability to participate in our specialized training and development programs to further enhance their cybersecurity skillsets and cross-train on related capabilities. The CISO works closely with the Company\u2019s internal legal team to oversee compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual security requirements;\n\u2022Risk assessments designed to help identify and prioritize significant cybersecurity risks. Our process for identifying and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats includes incorporation of an internally developed threat catalog and our tracking of trends for areas such as vulnerability management, our leverage of technical standards and guidance, input from our participation and collaboration with law enforcement and government initiatives, and our internal and vendor-supported threat intelligence initiatives. The cybersecurity risk assessment operates alongside our broader overall enterprise-wide risk assessment and management process, and key cybersecurity risks are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee in a manner that helps frame cybersecurity risks as part of a broader risk context;\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\n\u2022Regular testing and assessments of our systems and controls to evaluate the information security program maturity and effectiveness using cybersecurity frameworks (such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and SOC 2) and to identify and address potential vulnerabilities-and as appropriate, we adjust our policies, standards, and processes based on testing and assessment results;\n\u2022A vulnerability management program to determine the in-scope systems, patch systems based on criticality, and disclose potential vulnerabilities;\n\u2022A cybersecurity incident response plan and scenario-specific playbooks for responding to various types of cybersecurity incidents;\n\u2022Business continuity and disaster recovery plans to support more effective response and recovery efforts in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident or disruption;\n\u2022The use of external service providers and consultants to assess or monitor the environment or otherwise assist with aspects of our cybersecurity controls;\n\u2022Commercially available and customized security technologies and security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data;\n\u2022A security awareness and training program for our employees and contractors, with role-based training for certain personnel and positions; and\n\u2022A third-party risk management framework designed to monitor and address cybersecurity risks from various third parties (including vendors, service providers, and other contractors) that includes diligence regarding the third party\u2019s cybersecurity capabilities and additional monitoring of certain third parties based on the results of diligence. In addition, we have established standard contractual terms and conditions regarding cybersecurity applicable to third parties, as well as further downstream parties, that may be tailored to the use case and sensitivity of any data or business processes involved.\nAdditionally, we maintain cybersecurity insurance which may cover some or all of the potential losses from a cybersecurity incident. During the last fiscal year, we did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that materially affected Intuit, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, we continue to face ongoing and increasing cybersecurity risks which may materially affect us in the future. Additional information on the cybersecurity risks is discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, including without limitation the risk that \u201cSecurity incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers\u2019 data, or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.\u201d\nGOVERNANCE\nManagement is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Intuit\u2019s cybersecurity policies, processes, practices, and risk management. The Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides primary oversight of cybersecurity risks and the Company\u2019s efforts to mitigate those risks.\nMANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT\nAs part of management oversight, our CEO receives monthly updates from the CISO and representatives from CyberCRAFT. These updates provide a recurring overview of cybersecurity trends and status updates (e.g., security events, fraud detection, IT roadmap progress, follow-up from prior assessments, security awareness exercise results), as well as a more focused analysis on select cybersecurity topics for the month. Examples of prior topics include: recent cybersecurity legislation, cybersecurity incidents affecting external entities, and trends in cybersecurity controls and adoption. As part of our incident response processes, incidents are classified based on the incident\u2019s characteristics. For certain risk-based classifications of incidents, the CEO and other members of the executive leadership team are also informed and contribute as part of our incident response processes.\nBOARD OVERSIGHT\nOur full Board of Directors provides ultimate oversight for the cybersecurity program, in addition to other significant risks of Intuit. The Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit and Risk Committee to provide the primary oversight of cybersecurity risks. On a quarterly basis, the CISO and CyberCRAFT specialists present the Audit and Risk Committee with updates, metrics, and trends, such as the status of prior security events, existing and emerging threat landscapes, the results of audits or assessments, fraud prevention efforts, vulnerability detection and disclosure changes, and the status of projects to strengthen our security systems and improve incident readiness, and how these may affect broader enterprise risk management. Under our incident response processes\u2019 risk-based escalation protocols, the CISO, or other management, escalates certain incidents to the chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, who may then involve the broader committee or the full Board of Directors, as appropriate.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents",

This should allow the readers of this report to obtain a comprehensive understanding of our businesses, strategies, current trends, and future prospects. Our MD&A includes the following sections:\nYou should note that this MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d immediately preceding Part I of this Annual Report for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.\nYou should read this MD&A in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn the Results of Operations sections of this MD&A, where we describe two or more factors that contributed to changes in revenue and operating income, we have, where possible, quantified the impact of those factors. Where a change is the result of multiple factors that are interrelated and cannot be separately quantified, we have identified the interrelated factors without quantifying them.\nOn November 1, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of The Rocket Science Group LLC (Mailchimp). Our Mailchimp offerings are part of our Small Business & Self-Employed segment. We have included the results of operations of Mailchimp in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, to align our presentation of revenue and cost of revenue with our current revenue mix, we began to aggregate other revenue with product revenue, rather than service revenue, and cost of other revenue with cost of product revenue, rather than cost of service revenue. We reclassified the previously reported balances to conform to the current presentation. The reclassification was not material and had no impact on previously reported total net revenue or cost of revenue.\nOn August 1, 2023, we reorganized certain technology functions in our Consumer and ProTax segments that support and benefit our overall platform. Additionally, certain workplace and real estate functions in our Small Business & Self-Employed segment are now managed at the corporate level. As a result of these reorganizations, costs associated with these functions are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we reclassified $49 million and $21 million from Small Business & Self-Employed, $168 million and $150 million from Consumer, and $60 million and $64 million from ProTax to other corporate expenses, respectively. See Note 15, \u201cSegment Information,\u201d for more information.\nIn July 2024, our management approved, committed to, and initiated a plan of reorganization (the Plan) focused on reallocating resources to our key growth areas. The Plan includes the exit of employees and the closing of real estate sites in certain markets in service to growing technology teams and capabilities in strategic locations. We expect the actions associated with the Plan to be substantially complete by the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Restructuring costs associated with the Plan are estimated to be approximately $247 million. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, we recorded a $223 million charge in connection with the Plan. This charge is primarily related to severance and employee benefits and is recorded to restructuring in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nOn August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the end-to-end platform that customers use to grow and run their business.\nThis overview provides a high-level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business.

These shifts are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations are shifting around the world as more services become digitized and the array of choices continues to increase.\nSeasonality\nOur Consumer and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.\nWe expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProTax businesses to continue to have a material impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.\nOur growth strategy depends upon our ability to innovate, develop, and introduce emerging technologies, including AI and GenAI, to drive broad adoption of our products and services and enter new markets. Our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen new and existing relationships. To remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Much of our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and develop highly skilled employees, including those in technical and leadership roles who are critical to our strategic growth, in a highly competitive talent environment.\nAs we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.\nWe operate in industries that are experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties. We implement additional security measures, and we continue to work with state and federal governments to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, including sharing information regarding suspicious activity. We continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.\nOur operations are impacted by a rapidly-evolving regulatory environment and face increasingly heightened scrutiny. We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a broad and increasing range of subjects, both in the U.S. and internationally.\nFor a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business, please see \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d immediately preceding Part I and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; operating income growth for the company as a whole; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. We also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. Service offerings are a significant part of our business. Our total service revenue was $13.9 billion, or 85% of our total revenue in fiscal 2024, and we expect our total service revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to grow over the long term.\nKey highlights for fiscal 2024 include the following:\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we are required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a material impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss, and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies:\n\u2022Revenue Recognition\n\u2022Business Combinations\n\u2022Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets - Impairment Assessments\n\u2022Legal Contingencies\n\u2022Accounting for Income Taxes - Estimates of Deferred Taxes, Valuation Allowances, and Uncertain Tax Positions\nOur senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from the sale of online services such as tax, accounting, payroll, merchant payment processing services, delivery of qualified links, marketing automation, customer relationship management, and desktop software products and desktop software subscriptions. Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services, which are primarily recognized ratably over the relevant period. In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process. The primary judgments include identifying the performance obligations in the contract and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct. If any of these judgments were to change, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period. For additional information, see \u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition\u201d in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nBusiness Combinations\nAs described in \u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Business Combinations,\u201d in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, under the acquisition method of accounting, we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method allows us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheets.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.\nGoodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets - Impairment Assessments\nWe estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We test for potential impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the annual test may result in charges to our consolidated statements of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.\nAs described in \u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets,\u201d in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). The income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. We evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level. Although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. When using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment.\nWe estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. In order to estimate the fair value of those assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nintangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of cost, accumulated amortization, and weighted-average life in years for our acquired intangible assets.\nAssumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. For example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. Impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. Using the methodology described in \u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets,\u201d in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims, and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote, as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nAccounting for Income Taxes - Estimates of Deferred Taxes, Valuation Allowances, and Uncertain Tax Positions\nWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the United States Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance could have an adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the change.\nWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 can be found under Item 7 of Part II in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on September 1, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at investors.intuit.com.\nTotal net revenue increased $1.9 billion, or 13%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023. Small Business & Self-Employed segment revenue increased 19% due to growth in our Online Ecosystem revenue. Consumer segment revenue increased 7% due to the interrelated factors of a shift in mix to our higher-priced services offerings, such as TurboTax Live, and higher effective prices. See \u201cSegment Results\u201d later in this Item 7 for more information.\nOperating income increased $489 million, or 16%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023. The increase in operating income was due to the increase in revenue described above and an increase in expenses. Expenses increased due to staffing, marketing, restructuring, share-based compensation, and outside services. See \u201cOperating Expenses\u201d later in this Item 7 for more information. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our restructuring charges.\nNet income increased $579 million, or 24%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023. The increase in net income was due to the increase in operating income described above, an increase in interest income due to higher average interest rates, and a decrease in income tax expense related to higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. Diluted net income per share increased 24% to $10.43 for fiscal 2024, in line with the increase in net income.\nThe information below is organized in accordance with our four reportable segments. All of our segments operate and sell to customers primarily in the United States. Total international net revenue was approximately 8% of consolidated total net revenue in each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nOn November 1, 2021, we acquired Mailchimp in a business combination. Our Mailchimp offerings are part of our Small Business & Self-Employed segment. We have included the results of operations of Mailchimp in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, to align our presentation of revenue and cost of revenue with our current revenue mix, we began to aggregate other revenue with product revenue, rather than service revenue, and cost of other revenue with cost of product revenue, rather than cost of service revenue. We reclassified the previously reported balances to conform to the current presentation. The reclassification was not material and had no impact on previously reported total net revenue or cost of revenue.\nOn August 1, 2023, we reorganized certain technology functions in our Consumer and ProTax segments that support and benefit our overall platform. Additionally, certain workplace and real estate functions in our Small Business & Self-Employed segment are now managed at the corporate level. As a result of these reorganizations, costs associated with these functions are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we reclassified $49 million and $21 million from Small Business & Self-Employed, $168 million and $150 million from Consumer, and $60 million and $64 million from ProTax to other corporate expenses, respectively.\nSegment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. We include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, general and administrative, and non-employment related legal and litigation settlement costs, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items as part of other corporate expenses. For our Credit Karma segment, expenses include certain direct expenses related to selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative. Unallocated corporate items for all segments include share-based compensation, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, professional fees and transaction charges related to business combinations, and restructuring charges. These unallocated corporate costs for all segments totaled $5.9 billion in fiscal 2024, $5.2 billion in fiscal\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\n2023, and $4.6 billion in fiscal 2022. Unallocated corporate items increased in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023 due to increases in restructuring costs, share-based compensation expense, and product development expense. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for reconciliations of total segment operating income to consolidated operating income for each fiscal year presented.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSmall Business & Self-Employed segment revenue includes both Online Ecosystem and Desktop Ecosystem revenue.\nOur Online Ecosystem includes revenue from:\n\u2022QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Live, QuickBooks Online Advanced, QuickBooks Self-Employed, and QuickBooks Solopreneur financial and business management offerings;\n\u2022QuickBooks Online Payroll;\n\u2022Merchant payment processing and bill pay services for small and mid-market businesses that use online offerings;\n\u2022Mailchimp\u2019s marketing automation and customer relationship management offerings;\n\u2022QuickBooks Checking; and\n\u2022Financing for small businesses.\nOur Desktop Ecosystem includes revenue from:\n\u2022QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions (QuickBooks Desktop Pro Plus, QuickBooks Desktop Premier Plus, and QuickBooks Enterprise, and ProAdvisor Program memberships for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses);\n\u2022Desktop payroll products (QuickBooks Basic Payroll, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll, and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll);\n\u2022Merchant payment processing services for small and mid-market businesses that use desktop offerings;\n\u2022Financial supplies; and\n\u2022Financing for small businesses.\nSegment service revenue is primarily derived from our Online Ecosystem revenue and revenue from the services and support that are provided as part of our QuickBooks Desktop subscription and desktop payroll offerings, as well as merchant payment processing services. Segment product and other revenue is primarily derived from revenue related to delivery of software licenses and the related updates, including version protection, for our QuickBooks Desktop subscription and desktop payroll offerings, which are part of our Desktop Ecosystem. Our fiscal 2022 revenue includes Mailchimp revenue from the date of acquisition, which was November 1, 2021.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nRevenue classified by significant service and product offerings was as follows:\nRevenue for our Small Business & Self-Employed segment increased $1.5 billion, or 19%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023. The increase was due to growth in Online Ecosystem revenue, which contributed to $1.1 billion of the increase for fiscal 2024.\nOnline Ecosystem\nOnline Ecosystem revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 20%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023. Online Services revenue increased $603 million, or 21%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023 due to increases in revenue from our payroll offerings of $211 million, our payments offerings of $203 million, and Mailchimp of $125 million. Revenue increases were due to the interrelated factors described below. Online payroll revenue increased due to customer growth, higher effective prices, and a shift in mix to higher-end offerings. Online payments revenue increased due to customer growth, higher effective prices, and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Mailchimp revenue increased due to higher effective prices and paid customer growth. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue increased $530 million, or 19%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023 due to customer growth, higher effective prices, and a shift in mix to our higher-priced offerings.\nOnline Ecosystem average revenue per customer, which we define as total online ecosystem revenue divided by the average number of online paying customers, increased 11% for fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023. Online ecosystem paying customers, which we define as the sum of all QuickBooks Online customers, QuickBooks Time customers, Mailchimp paying customers, and customers who subscribe to standalone services outside of their QuickBooks Online experience, increased 6% as of July 31, 2024 compared with July 31, 2023.\nDesktop Ecosystem\nDesktop Ecosystem revenue increased $362 million, or 16%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, $252 million of which is due to the interrelated factors of customer growth and price increases primarily in our QuickBooks Desktop and Enterprise subscription offerings. Approximately $110 million of fiscal 2024 revenue is associated with changes we made to our offerings in fiscal 2024 to complete the transition to a recurring subscription model, which more closely aligns our Desktop license and related product updates to our Desktop subscription billing model.\nSmall Business & Self-Employed segment operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 25%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, due to the increase in revenue described above, which was partially offset by increases in marketing expenses of $105 million, staffing expenses of $67 million, and outside services expenses of $54 million.\nIn August 2023, we reorganized certain workplace and real estate functions that are now managed at the corporate level. As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we reclassified $49 million and $21 million, respectively, from Small Business & Self-Employed to other corporate expenses.\nOn August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the end-to-end platform that customers use to grow and run their business.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nConsumer segment service revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax Online and TurboTax Live offerings, electronic tax filing services, and connected services.\nConsumer segment product and other revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax desktop tax return preparation software and related form updates.\nRevenue for our Consumer segment increased $310 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, due to the interrelated factors of a shift in mix to our higher-priced service offerings, such as TurboTax Live, and higher effective prices.\nConsumer segment operating income increased $45 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, due to the increase in revenue described above, partially offset by increases in marketing expenses of $116 million, staffing expenses of $70 million associated with both our shift in mix to our higher-priced service offerings and increasing service availability, and outside services expenses of $24 million.\nIn August 2023, we reorganized certain technology functions that support and benefit our overall platform. As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we reclassified $168 million and $150 million, respectively, from Consumer to other corporate expenses.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nCredit Karma segment revenue is primarily derived from cost-per-action transactions, which include the delivery of qualified links that result in completed actions such as credit card issuances and personal loan funding; cost-per-click and cost-per-lead transactions, which include user clicks on advertisements or advertisements that allow for the generation of leads, and primarily relate to mortgage and insurance businesses; and Credit Karma Money.\nRevenue for our Credit Karma segment increased $74 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, due to increases in revenue from our credit card vertical of $32 million, auto insurance vertical of $25 million, and Credit Karma Money of $20 million, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our home loan vertical of $6 million.\nCredit Karma segment operating income decreased $14 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, due to increases in marketing expenses of $68 million and outside services expenses of $28 million, partially offset by the increase in revenue described above.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nProTax segment service revenue is derived primarily from ProConnect Tax Online tax products, electronic tax filing services, connected services, and bank products.\nProTax segment product and other revenue is derived primarily from Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProFile desktop tax preparation software products, and related form updates.\nRevenue for our ProTax segment increased $38 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, due to higher average revenue per customer.\nProTax segment operating income increased $32 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, due to the increase in revenue described above. Expenses were relatively flat in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023.\nIn August 2023, we reorganized certain technology functions that support and benefit our overall platform. As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we reclassified $60 million and $64 million, respectively, from ProTax to other corporate expenses.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nOur cost of revenue has three components: (1) cost of service revenue, which includes the direct costs associated with our online and service offerings, such as costs for data processing and storage capabilities from cloud providers, ongoing production support costs, customer support costs, costs for the tax and bookkeeping experts that support our TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live offerings, and costs related to credit score providers; (2) cost of product and other revenue, which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping or electronically downloading our desktop software and financial supplies products; and (3) amortization of acquired technology, which represents the cost of amortizing developed technologies that we have obtained through acquisitions, over their useful lives.\nCost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue was relatively consistent in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\nCost of product and other revenue as a percentage of product and other revenue was consistent in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023. Costs of product and other revenue are expensed as incurred, and we do not defer any of these costs when product and other revenue is deferred.\nTotal operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue was flat in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Total net revenue increased $1.9 billion, or 13%, and total operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 14%. The increase in total operating expenses was due to increases of $294 million for marketing expenses, $257 million for staffing due to higher headcount, $223 million in restructuring charges which includes $25 million in share-based compensation, and $175 million for other share-based compensation. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding restructuring charges.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $242 million and $248 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisted of interest on our senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and secured revolving credit facilities.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nInterest and Other Income, Net\n(1) Interest income increased in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, due to higher average interest rates.\n(2) In accordance with authoritative guidance, we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income, and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expenses. The total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 was approximately 17%. Excluding certain tax benefits primarily related to share-based compensation, our effective tax rate was approximately 24%. This rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was approximately 20%. Excluding the tax benefits related to share-based compensation and a transfer of certain intangible assets from our United Kingdom subsidiary to the United States, our effective tax rate was approximately 24%. This rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about our effective tax rates.\nAt July 31, 2024, we had net deferred tax assets of $695 million, which included a valuation allowance for California net deferred tax assets primarily related to state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards, foreign loss carryforwards, and state operating loss carryforwards. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d earlier in this Item 7 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nUnder the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, research and development costs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021 are no longer fully deductible and are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes. The mandatory capitalization requirement, effective for us beginning August 1, 2022, significantly increased our deferred tax assets and income taxes payable for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, and we expect it to continue to cause an increase in our deferred tax assets and income taxes payable in the near term.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022. This law, among other provisions, provides a corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income, which was effective for us beginning in fiscal 2024. There was no impact from the corporate alternative minimum tax in fiscal 2024. The corporate alternative minimum tax is not expected to have a significant impact to our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate impacts, if any, of these provisions on our results of operations and cash flows for future years.\nIn 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced Pillar Two Model Rules, which call for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in fiscal 2025 with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. The currently enacted Pillar Two Model Rules are not expected to have a significant impact to our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate impacts, if any, of these provisions on our results of operations and cash flows for future years.\nIn the current global tax policy environment, the U.S. and other domestic and foreign governments continue to consider, and in some cases enact, changes in corporate tax laws. As changes occur, we account for finalized legislation in the period of enactment.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nAt July 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of $412 million from July 31, 2023, due to the factors described in \u201cStatements of Cash Flows\u201d below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which primarily includes the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, the issuance of senior unsecured notes, and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, acquisitions of businesses, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, the payment of cash dividends, debt service costs and debt repayment, and capital projects. As discussed in \u201cExecutive Overview - Industry Trends and Seasonality\u201d earlier in this Item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.\nThe following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:\n__________________________\nNM - Not meaningful\nWe have historically generated significant cash from operations, and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2025. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $4.1 billion at July 31, 2024. None of those funds were restricted, and approximately 92% of those funds were located in the U.S.\nOn November 1, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Mailchimp. The fair value of the purchase consideration totaled $12.0 billion, and included $5.7 billion in cash, and 10.1 million shares of Intuit common stock with a fair value of $6.3 billion. See \"Business Combinations\" below for more information.\nIn September 2023, we issued $4 billion in senior unsecured notes, and used the proceeds, together with operating cash, to repay the outstanding balance on our term loan.\nIn October 2023, we made tax payments of $710 million as a result of 2023 IRS disaster relief which allowed the deferral of certain fiscal 2023 tax payments to the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nOn February 5, 2024, we terminated our amended and restated credit agreement dated November 1, 2021, and entered into an unsecured credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on February 5, 2029. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes. At July 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nIn June 2024, we established a $1.5 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper). As of July 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under this program.\nOur secured revolving credit facilities are available to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses. At July 31, 2024, $585 million was outstanding under both secured revolving credit facilities.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and commercial paper program, and access to external financing will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months.\nWe expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.\nWe evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. Our strong liquidity profile enables us to quickly respond to these types of opportunities.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe following table summarizes selected items from our consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022. See the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for complete consolidated statements of cash flows for those periods.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we generated $4.9 billion in cash from operations. We also received $4.0 billion from the issuance of unsecured senior notes, $3.4 billion from the net increase in funds receivable and funds payable and amounts due to customers, $422 million from the net sales and maturities of investments, $282 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, and $155 million from net borrowings under our secured credit facilities. During the same period, we used $4.2 billion for the repayment of debt, $2.0 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $1.0 billion for the payment of cash dividends, $1.0 billion for payments for employee taxes withheld upon vesting of restricted stock units, $250 million for capital expenditures, and $236 million for net originations of term loans to small businesses.\nDuring fiscal 2023, we generated $5.0 billion in cash from operations. We also received $222 million from borrowings under our secured credit facilities, and $228 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period, we used $2.0 billion for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $1.0 billion for the repayment of debt, $889 million for the payment of cash dividends, $633 million for payments for employee taxes withheld upon vesting of restricted stock units, $326 million for the net purchases of investments, $260 million for capital expenditures, and $256 million for net originations of term loans to small businesses.\nAs described in Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under a series of repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized. At July 31, 2024, we had authorization from our Board of Directors for up to $1.9 billion in stock repurchases. On August 20, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the authorization under the existing stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $3.0 billion of our common stock. We currently expect to continue repurchasing our common stock on a quarterly basis; however, future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nWe have continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock. During fiscal 2024, we declared cash dividends that totaled $3.60 per share of outstanding common stock, or approximately $1.0 billion. In August 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.04 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 10, 2024. We currently expect to continue to pay comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nMailchimp\nOn November 1, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Mailchimp for total consideration of $12.0 billion, which included $5.7 billion in cash and 10.1 million shares of Intuit common stock with a fair value of $6.3 billion. The fair value of the stock consideration is based on the October 29, 2021 closing price of Intuit common stock of $625.99.\nPursuant to the equity purchase agreement, we also issued approximately 583,000 restricted stock units (RSUs) in substitution of outstanding equity incentive awards. These RSUs have a grant date fair value of approximately $355 million and are being expensed over three years. Additionally, we issued approximately 325,000 RSUs with a total grant date fair value of approximately $211 million to Mailchimp employees, of which $151 million is being expensed over four years and $60 million was expensed during the first six months following the acquisition date.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nMailchimp is part of our Small Business & Self-Employed segment. We have included the financial results of Mailchimp in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nIn June 2020, we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes, of which $1.5 billion is outstanding as of July 31, 2024, and is comprised of the following:\n\u2022$500 million of 0.950% notes due July 2025;\n\u2022$500 million of 1.350% notes due July 2027; and\n\u2022$500 million of 1.650% notes due July 2030 (together, the 2020 Notes).\nInterest is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. At July 31, 2024, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the 2020 Notes was $75 million through the maturity dates.\nThe 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Upon the occurrence of change of control transactions that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the 2020 Notes, we will be required to repurchase the 2020 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 2020 Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the 2020 Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2020 Notes. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nIn September 2023, we issued $4 billion of senior unsecured notes comprised of the following:\n\u2022$750 million of 5.250% notes due September 2026;\n\u2022$750 million of 5.125% notes due September 2028;\n\u2022$1,250 million of 5.200% notes due September 2033; and\n\u2022$1,250 million of 5.500% notes due September 2053 (together, the 2023 Notes).\nInterest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. At July 31, 2024, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the 2023 Notes was $2.9 billion through the maturity dates.\nThe 2023 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The indenture governing the 2023 Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the 2023 Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2023 Notes. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 5, 2024, we terminated our amended and restated credit agreement dated November 1, 2021 (2021 Credit Facility), and entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on February 5, 2029 (2024 Credit Facility).\nUnder the 2024 Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain customary conditions, including approval of relevant lenders, on one or more occasions, increase commitments under the 2024 Credit Facility by an amount not to exceed $1 billion in the aggregate, and, on one or more occasions, extend the maturity date of the 2024 Credit Facility by one year. The 2024 Credit Facility includes a $500 million sublimit for borrowing swingline loans and a $250 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates equal to (a) in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125%, or (ii) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%, or (b) in the case of foreign currency borrowings, the interest benchmark for the relevant currency specified in the credit agreement plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%. Actual margins under either election are based on our senior debt credit ratings.\nThe 2024 Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the agreement, of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as measured on a rolling twelve month basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all required covenants. At July 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing for the credit facility.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSecured Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2019, a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses (the 2019 Secured Facility). The 2019 Secured Facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. We have entered into several amendments to this facility, most recently on July 19, 2024. These amendments primarily increase the facility limit, extend the commitment term and final maturity date, and update the benchmark interest rate. Under the amended 2019 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $500 million, of which $300 million is committed and $200 million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at adjusted daily simple SOFR plus 1.5%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue interest at a rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through August 31, 2025, and the final maturity date is August 31, 2026. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all required covenants. At July 31, 2024, $285 million was outstanding under the 2019 Secured Facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 6.99%, which includes the interest on the unused committed portion. The outstanding balance is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary totaling $1.1 billion.\nOn October 12, 2022, another subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses (the 2022 Secured Facility). The 2022 Secured Facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. We have entered into several amendments to this facility, most recently on April 30, 2024. These amendments primarily extend the commitment term and final maturity dates and increase the commitment amount. Under the amended 2022 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $500 million, of which $300 million is committed and $200 million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at SOFR plus 1.3%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue interest at a rate ranging from 0.2% to 0.4%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through April 30, 2026, and the final maturity date is April 30, 2027. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all required covenants. At July 31, 2024, $300 million was outstanding under the 2022 Secured Facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 6.68%. The outstanding balance is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary totaling $832 million.\nIn June 2024, we established a $1.5 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper). The maturities of the commercial paper may vary up to 397 days from the date of issuance. As of July 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under this program.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $4.1 billion at July 31, 2024. Approximately 8% of those funds were held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, and India. We do not expect to pay incremental U.S. taxes on repatriation. We have recorded income tax expense for Canada, India, and Israel withholding taxes on earnings that are not permanently reinvested. In the event that funds from foreign operations are repatriated to the United States, we would pay withholding taxes at that time.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2024. We generally expect to fund these short and long-term obligations with cash from operations, the issuance of senior unsecured notes, and borrowings under our credit facilities.\n(1)Includes operating leases for facilities and equipment. Amounts do not include $14 million of future sublease income. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\n(2)Represents agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments.\n(3)Other long-term obligations on our consolidated balance sheet at July 31, 2024, included long-term income tax liabilities of $157 million, which related primarily to unrecognized tax benefits. We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET\nRISK\nInvestment Portfolio and Interest Rate Risk\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control.\nOur investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments or European sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments. See Note 2 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue.\nOur cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. At July 31, 2024, our cash equivalents and investments totaled $3.2 billion and had a weighted-average pre-tax yield of 5.185%. Total interest income for fiscal 2024 was $147 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2024, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $1 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2024, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $3 million.\nIn June 2020, we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes which was comprised of the following: $500 million of 0.650% notes due in July 2023, $500 million of 0.950% notes due in July 2025, $500 million of 1.350% notes due in July 2027, and $500 million of 1.650% notes due in July 2030 (together, the 2020 Notes). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we repaid the $500 million in notes due in July 2023 when they became due using cash from operations. We carry the 2020 Notes at face value, less unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. Since these 2020 Notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the 2020 Notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nIn September 2023, we issued $4 billion of senior unsecured notes, which was comprised of the following: $750 million of 5.250% notes due in September 2026, $750 million of 5.125% notes due in September 2028, $1,250 million of 5.200% notes due in September 2033, and $1,250 million of 5.500% notes due in September 2053 (together, the 2023 Notes). We carry the 2023 Notes at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. Since these 2023 Notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with the changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the 2023 Notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nOn February 5, 2024, we terminated our amended and restated credit agreement dated November 1, 2021 (2021 Credit Facility), and entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on February 5, 2029 (2024 Credit Facility). We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect the 2024 Credit Facility. Advances under the 2024 Credit Facility accrue interest at rates equal to (a) in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125%, or (ii) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%, or (b) in the case of foreign currency borrowings, the interest benchmark for the relevant currency specified in the credit agreement plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%. Actual margins under either election are based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates. At July 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility.\nWe are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our secured revolving credit facilities. Advances under the secured revolving credit facilities accrue interest at either SOFR plus 1.3% or adjusted daily simple SOFR plus 1.5%. Consequently, our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates. At July 31, 2024, $585 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facilities. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes\nThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate the revenue, costs, and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We include net gains and\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nlosses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income or expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nSince we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, Indian rupees, and British pounds) into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not material because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. We believe the impact of currency fluctuations will continue to not be material in the foreseeable future due to the reasons cited above. As of July 31, 2024, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents",

(the Company) as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated September 4, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nDetermination of Distinct Performance Obligations in Revenue Contracts\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into contracts with customers that often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. The Company has generally concluded that software licenses and services are separate performance obligations and revenues from software licenses and services are recognized as those products and services are provided.\nGiven the nature of the Company\u2019s product and service offerings, there is complexity in determining whether software licenses and services are considered performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or together. Auditing the Company\u2019s determination of distinct performance obligations related to its various product and service offerings involved complex auditor judgment. In particular, significant judgment was required when assessing whether the promised products and services are separate performance obligations or inputs to a combined performance obligation due to the evaluation of the interdependency or interrelation of the promised products and services within each contract.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company\u2019s processes, as they relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations. We also obtained an understanding of the Company\u2019s product and service offerings and tested the application of the revenue recognition accounting model to determine distinct performance obligations.\nAmong other audit procedures, we evaluated whether the performance obligations identified by the Company were capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract through review of contracts, discussions with management, observing product demonstrations and review of the Company\u2019s website and other marketing materials. More specifically, we evaluated the Company\u2019s determination of whether the contract was to deliver (1) multiple promised products or services that constitute separate performance obligations or (2) a single performance obligation that is comprised of the combined products or services. That is, considering the utility, integration, interrelation or interdependence of the products and services, we evaluated whether the multiple promised products and services that were delivered to the customer were outputs or inputs to a combined item.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1990.\nSan Jose, California\nSeptember 4, 2024\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Intuit Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intuit Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated September 4, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nSeptember 4, 2024\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSee accompanying notes.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSee accompanying notes.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSee accompanying notes.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSee accompanying notes.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSee accompanying notes.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nDescription of Business\nIntuit helps consumers and small and mid-market businesses prosper by delivering financial management, compliance, and marketing products and services. We also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals, who are key partners that help us serve small and mid-market business customers.\nWe help consumers do their taxes with ease and confidence, understand their financial picture, build credit, save more to make ends meet, get their largest tax refund, pay off debt, and receive personalized suggestions on how to grow their money. We help small and mid-market businesses grow and run their business all in one place, including bookkeeping, getting paid, accessing capital, paying employees, getting and retaining customers, and managing their customer relationships.\nWe do this through our global AI-driven expert platform and our offerings including TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp. Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online are our leading tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Incorporated in 1984 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our products and services primarily in the United States.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation.\nWe acquired The Rocket Science Group LLC (Mailchimp) on November 1, 2021. We have included the results of operations for Mailchimp in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. Our Mailchimp offerings are part of our Small Business & Self-Employed segment. See Note 7, \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d for more information.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, to align our presentation of revenue and cost of revenue with our current revenue mix, we began to aggregate other revenue with product revenue, rather than service revenue, and cost of other revenue with cost of product revenue, rather than cost of service revenue. We reclassified the previously reported balances to conform to the current presentation. The reclassification was not material and had no impact on previously reported total net revenue or cost of revenue.\nOn August 1, 2023, we reorganized certain technology functions in our Consumer and ProTax segments that support and benefit our overall platform. Additionally, certain workplace and real estate functions in our Small Business & Self-Employed segment are now managed at the corporate level. As a result of these reorganizations, costs associated with these functions are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we reclassified $49 million and $21 million from Small Business & Self-Employed, $168 million and $150 million from Consumer, and $60 million and $64 million from ProTax to other corporate expenses, respectively. See Note 15, \u201cSegment Information,\u201d for more information.\nOn August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the end-to-end platform that customers use to grow and run their business. See Note 15, \u201cSegment Information,\u201d for more information.\nSeasonality\nOur Consumer and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use judgments and estimates in determining how revenue should be recognized. These judgments and estimates include identifying performance obligations, determining if the performance obligations are distinct, determining the standalone sales price (SSP) and timing of revenue recognition for each\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\ndistinct performance obligation, and estimating variable consideration to be included in the transaction price. We use estimates in determining the collectibility of accounts receivable and notes receivable held for investment, the appropriate levels of various accruals including accruals for litigation contingencies, the discount rate used to calculate lease liabilities, the amount of our worldwide tax provision, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities, reserves for losses, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, and the fair value of notes receivable held for sales. We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and fair values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units and share-based compensation. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions, hosted services, payroll services, merchant payment processing services, software products, live expert advice, financing for small businesses, delivery of qualified links, and financial supplies and hardware. We enter into contracts with customers that include promises to transfer various products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized when the promised goods or services are transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration allocated to the respective performance obligation.\nNature of Products and Services\nOnline Offerings\nOur online offerings include TurboTax Online and TurboTax Live, ProConnect Tax Online, QuickBooks Online, online payroll, and merchant payment processing services for small and mid-market businesses who use our online offerings. Our Mailchimp offerings include marketing automation and customer relationship management.\nThese online offerings provide customers with the right to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software and are billed on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to our online offerings that are billed on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to online offerings that are billed on a consumption basis is recognized when the customer consumes the related service.\nDesktop Offerings\nOur desktop offerings consist of our subscription-based QuickBooks Desktop products, our consumer and professional tax desktop products, which include TurboTax, Lacerte and ProSeries, our desktop payroll products, and merchant payment processing services for small and mid-market businesses who use our desktop offerings.\nOur QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions include a term software license, version protection, enhancements, support, and various connected services. We recognize revenue for the software license and version protection at the time they are delivered and recognize revenue for support and connected services over the subscription term as the services are provided. Beginning with subscriptions sold in fiscal year 2024, periodic delivery of version protection occurs through the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and the associated revenue is recognized upon delivery as noted above. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, upgrades and enhancements will be delivered on a when-and-if-available basis, and the associated revenue will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term those upgrades and enhancements are provided. Previously, we have determined that the enhancements included in our QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions were not material within the context of the contract.\nOur consumer and professional tax desktop software products include an on-premise tax software license, related tax form updates, electronic filing service, and connected services. We recognize revenue for the software license and related tax form updates, as one performance obligation, over the period the forms and updates are delivered. We recognize revenue for our electronic filings service and connected services as those services are provided.\nWe also sell some of our consumer tax desktop software products in non-consignment and consignment arrangements to certain retailers. Additionally, we sell our QuickBooks Enterprise software on retailer websites. For these retailers, we begin recognizing revenue at the later of when control has transferred to the retailer or customer for consumer tax desktop software and upon activation of the subscriptions by the customer for QuickBooks subscription offerings.\nOur desktop payroll products are sold as software subscriptions and include a term software license with a stand-ready obligation to maintain compliance with current payroll tax laws, support, and connected services. The term software license and stand-ready obligation to maintain compliance with current payroll tax laws is considered one performance obligation. Each of the performance obligations is considered distinct, and control is transferred to the customer over the subscription term. As a result, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term as services are provided.\nWe offer merchant payment processing services as a separately paid connected service for our QuickBooks Desktop software products and software subscriptions, and revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customers.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nOther Solutions\nRevenue from our Credit Karma segment is primarily comprised of revenue from the delivery of qualified links that result in completed actions, or cost-per-action transactions. Credit Karma also generates revenue from cost-per-click and cost-per-lead transactions. All revenue from our Credit Karma segment is included in service revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCost-per-action revenue is earned based on a pre-determined fee for approved actions, such as when credit cards are issued or when personal loans and other loans to businesses are funded. Revenue is recognized when a lead is generated that results in one of these approved actions.\nCost-per-click and cost-per-lead revenue is primarily related to mortgage and insurance businesses. Cost-per-click revenue is earned as users click on our customers' advertisements and is recognized based on the number of clicks recorded each month. Cost-per-lead revenue is earned via customer advertisements that allow the generation of leads from consumers interested in the advertised products and is recognized at the time a consumer request or lead is delivered to the customer.\nRevenue from the sale of our financial supplies, such as printed check stock and hardware, including credit card readers for mobile phones, is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are shipped.\nWe also have revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements with third-party partners and recognize this revenue as earned based upon reporting provided to us by our partners. In instances where we do not have reporting from our partners, we estimate revenue based on information available to us at the time.\nTypes of Revenue\nService revenue includes revenue from: our online offerings discussed above; our Credit Karma offerings; support, electronic filing services, and connected services included with our desktop offerings; merchant payment processing services; certain revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements; and interest on loans.\nProduct and other revenue includes revenue from: QuickBooks Desktop software licenses and version protection; consumer and professional tax desktop licenses and the related form updates; desktop payroll licenses and related updates; financial supplies; certain revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements; and interest on amounts held for customers.\nWe record revenue net of sales tax obligations. For payroll services, we generally require customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the payroll date via electronic funds transfer. Revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations. We hold customer cash as part of delivering payroll and payment services, and we include in total net revenue the interest earned on these funds from the time they are collected until the time that we remit them to outside parties or merchants.\nJudgments and Estimates\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates. These judgments and estimates include identifying performance obligations in the contract, determining whether the performance obligations are distinct, determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation, determining the timing of revenue recognition for distinct performance obligations, and estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price.\nThe functionality of the software licenses included in our consumer and professional tax and payroll desktop offerings is dependent on the related enhancements and updates included in these offerings. Judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the related updates and recognized over time.\nOur contracts with customers include promises to transfer various products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct performance obligations. In many cases, SSPs for distinct performance obligations are based on directly observable pricing. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nOur consumer and professional tax desktop products include an on-premise tax software license and related tax form updates that are recognized as the forms and updates are delivered. We measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the software license and related tax form updates using an output method based on the timing of when the tax forms are delivered.\nWe generally provide refunds to customers for product returns and subscription cancellations. We also provide promotional discounts and incentive rebates on retail and distribution sales. These refunds, discounts, and incentive rebates are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Refunds are estimated based on historical experience and current business and economic indicators and are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur. Discounts and incentive rebates are estimated based on distributors' and retailers' performance against the terms and conditions of the rebate programs.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nDeferred Revenue\nWe record deferred revenue when we have entered into a contract with a customer and cash payments are received or due prior to transfer of control or satisfaction of the related performance obligation. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, we recognized revenue of $920 million, that was included in deferred revenue at July 31, 2023. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2023, we recognized revenue of $808 million, that was included in deferred revenue at July 31, 2022.\nOur performance obligations are generally satisfied within 12 months of the initial contract date. As of July 31, 2024 and 2023, the deferred revenue balance related to performance obligations that will be satisfied after 12 months was $4 million and $5 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term obligations on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAssets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nOur sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining the contract with a customer. Sales commissions for subscription offerings where we expect the benefit of those costs to continue longer than one year, are capitalized and amortized ratably over the period of benefit, which ranges from three to four years. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract are not material and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs incurred to obtain a contract with a customer when the period of benefit is less than one year. These costs primarily include internal and external sales commissions for our consumer and professional tax offerings.\nShipping and Handling\nWe record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software products as product and other revenue, and we record the related costs as cost of product and other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCustomer Service and Technical Support\nWe include the costs of customer service and technical support associated with our online or hosted offerings in cost of service revenue line in our consolidated statements of operations. We also include the costs of providing technical support for our desktop offerings in cost of service revenue. We include the costs of customer service related to desktop offerings in selling and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, email, and other electronic means, and providing technical support assistance to customers. We expense the cost of providing this support as incurred.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInternal Use Software\nWe capitalize costs related to the development of hosted services that we provide to our customers and internal use of enterprise-level business and finance software in support of our operational needs. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are generally three to six years. Costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and to post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We test these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact their recoverability.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nAdvertising\nWe expense all advertising costs as we incur them to selling and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We recorded advertising expense of approximately $1.7 billion for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, $1.5 billion for the twelve months ended July 31, 2023, and $1.6 billion for the twelve months ended July 31, 2022.\nLeases\nOur leases are primarily operating leases for office facilities. We determine if an arrangement is a lease and classify it as either a finance or operating lease at lease inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Our leases generally do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined based on a yield curve derived from publicly traded bond offerings for companies with similar credit ratings to ours. Our lease terms may include options to purchase, extend, or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nWe measure ROU assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made to the lessor before or at the commencement date, net of lease incentives. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are not included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and are recognized as lease expense is incurred. Our variable lease payments generally relate to amounts paid to lessors for common area maintenance under our real estate leases.\nOur subleases generally do not relieve us of our primary obligations under the corresponding head lease. As a result, we account for the head lease based on the original assessment at inception. We determine if the sublease arrangement is either a sales-type, direct financing, or operating lease at inception. If the total remaining lease cost on the head lease for the term of the sublease is greater than the anticipated sublease income, the ROU asset is assessed for impairment. Our subleases are generally operating leases, and we recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term.\nCapitalization of Interest Expense\nWe capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was not material for any period presented.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate the revenue, costs, and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income or expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Translation gains and losses and transaction gains and losses were not material for any period presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.\nA description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d below.\nComputation of Net Income Per Share\nWe compute basic net income per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method.\nWe include stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with unrecognized compensation expense that is less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with unrecognized compensation expense that is greater than the average market price for our common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options and the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\nDividend rights apply to all RSUs that we grant and are accumulated and paid when the underlying RSUs vest. Since the dividend rights are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, they are considered a contingent transfer of value. Consequently, the RSUs are not considered participating securities, and we do not present them separately in earnings per share.\nThe following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nCash Equivalents and Investments\nWe consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. In all periods presented, cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds. Investments consist primarily of investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.\nWe use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We record unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets and reflect unrealized gain and loss activity in other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs, and acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. Third-party payment processor receivables due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit and debit card transactions for the sales of our products and services are included in accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for credit losses. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses, customer-specific information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible, we write them off against the allowance.\nFunds Receivable and Amounts Held for Customers and Funds Payable and Amounts Due to Customers\nFunds receivable and amounts held for customers represent funds receivable from third-party payment processors for customer transactions, funds in-transit to our customers, and funds held on behalf of our customers that are invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities, restricted for use solely for the purpose of satisfying amounts we owe on behalf of our customers. Funds payable and amounts due to customers consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers, such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we updated our terms of service and end user license agreements related to our payroll and payments offerings to reflect a change in our obligations with respect to funds we transmit on behalf of our customers. As a result of the change, our obligations are now satisfied when the funds are settled in the customers\u2019 accounts. These obligations, including funds in-transit to our customers, are reflected in funds payable and amounts due to customers in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under our previous agreements, our obligations were satisfied as of the point that we initiated the transmission of the funds on the customers\u2019 behalf.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the amortization of assets that are recorded under finance leases in depreciation expense. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not record any material property or equipment impairment charges during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination).\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. We measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that we incur to complete the\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nbusiness combination, such as investment banking, legal, and other professional fees, are not considered part of consideration, and we recognize such costs as general and administrative expenses as they are incurred. Under the acquisition method, we also account for acquired company restructuring activities that we initiate separately from the business combination.\nShould the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date, and we record those adjustments to our financial statements. We apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be material retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period, and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions regardless of acquisition date.\nGoodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill\nWe record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance, we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and generally use a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow model, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired.\nIf the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nAcquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe generally record acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as purchased technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to fifteen years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a finite life exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Impairment charges for acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets were not material for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nRSUs granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established market or performance goals. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\ncondition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met. Each quarter, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our RSUs for dividends.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.\nSee Note 12, \u201cStockholders\u2019 Equity,\u201d for a description of our share-based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation.\nRestructuring\nWe record charges associated with management-approved restructuring plans as restructuring in our consolidated statements of operations. These charges may include severance and employee benefits, and costs to vacate facilities. We generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and the amounts are estimable, or when notifications occur, depending on the region where the employee works. The liability for restructuring charges is included in accrued compensation and related liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers\nWe operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities, and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are also subject to risks related to changes in the value of our material balance of investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. Our cash balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits.\nWe sell a portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate, but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at July 31, 2024 or July 31, 2023.\nWe rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and fulfills orders for most of our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a material negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nSegment Information - In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\" This standard requires incremental segment information disclosures, including disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, which means that it will be effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2025 and for interim period reporting beginning in fiscal 2026. Early adoption is permitted, and retrospective adoption is required for all prior periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2023-07 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIncome Tax - In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\" This standard requires additional disclosures related to the income tax rate reconciliation, income taxes paid by jurisdiction, and other income tax-related disclosures. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\n2024, which means that it will be effective for us for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2026. Early adoption is permitted. The standard should be applied on a prospective basis, and retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In addition, we consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability\u2019s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three levels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows:\n\u2022Level 1 uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u2022Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\u2022Level 3 uses one or more unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar valuation techniques and significant management judgment or estimation.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above.\n(1) Carrying values on our consolidated balance sheets were $5.45 billion and $1.49 billion at July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 8, \u201cDebt\u201d for more information.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities by balance sheet classification and level in the fair value hierarchy at the dates indicated:\nWe value our Level 1 assets, consisting primarily of money market funds, using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.\nFinancial assets whose fair values we measure on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consist of corporate notes and U.S. agency securities. We measure the fair values of these assets with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Our fair value processes include controls designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our Level 2 investments. These controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager, validation of pricing sources and models, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period price fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\nFinancial assets whose fair values we measure using Level 3 inputs consist of notes receivable held for sale. These loans are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. As of July 31, 2024, total notes receivable held for sale were not material and the difference between amortized cost and fair value was not material.\nFinancial liabilities whose fair values we measure using Level 2 inputs consist of senior unsecured notes. See Note 8, \u201cDebt\u201d for more information. We measure the fair value of our senior unsecured notes based on their trading prices and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms.\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and our long-term investments.\nEstimates of fair value for reporting units fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. Using the methodology described in Note 1, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired.\nLong-term investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value. They are accounted for at cost and adjusted based on observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. These investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value of these investments using a valuation method based on observable transaction price changes at the transaction date. We recognized $4 million in upward adjustments during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024. We recognized no upward adjustments during the twelve months ended July 31, 2023. We recognized $54 million in upward adjustments during the twelve months ended July 31, 2022. Impairments recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, July 31, 2023, and July 31, 2022 were not material. Cumulative upward adjustments were $75 million, and cumulative impairments were not material through July 31, 2024 for measurement alternative investments held as of July 31, 2024. As of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, the carrying value of long-term investments was $131 million and $105 million, respectively.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and funds receivable and amounts held for customers by balance sheet classification at the dates indicated.\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and relevant portion of funds receivable and amounts held for customers by investment category at the dates indicated. As of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, this excludes $281 million and $216 million, respectively, of funds receivable included on our consolidated balance sheets in funds receivable and amounts held for customers not measured and recorded at fair value.\nWe include realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities in interest and other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Gross realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were not material.\nWe accumulate unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets, except for certain unrealized losses described below. Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023 were not material.\nFor available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The estimate of the credit loss is determined by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit loss is recorded to interest and other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Any excess unrealized loss greater than the allowance for credit loss at a security level is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We determined there were no credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities as of July 31, 2024. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2024 were not material. We do not intend to sell these investments. In addition, it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell them before recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt securities, included in investments and relevant portion of funds receivable and amounts held for customers, classified by the stated maturity date of the security at the dates indicated.\nThe following table summarizes our funds receivable and amounts held for customers by asset category at the dates indicated.\nAs of July 31, 2024, our notes receivable portfolio consisted of notes receivable held for investment, including term loans to small businesses and refund advance loans to consumers, and notes receivable held for sale, including term loans to small businesses. We classify loans as notes receivable held for investment when we have both the intent and ability to hold until maturity or payoff. We classify loans as notes receivable held for sale when we have the intent and ability to sell substantially all of our rights, title, and interests in these qualified loans to a third-party investor. A loan that is initially designated as held for sale or held for investment may be reclassified when our intent for that loan changes. When a loan held for investment is reclassified to held for sale and recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, the related allowance for credit loss for that loan is released, and any adjustment to record the loan at the lower of amortized cost or fair value is recorded.\nNotes Receivable Held for Investment\nTerm loans to small businesses. We provide financing to small businesses via term loans that we originate directly or through an originating bank partner. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we purchased term loans from our originating bank partner with principal balances in the amount of $1.8 billion and $144 million, respectively. As of July 31, 2024, we had commitments to purchase $16 million in term loans that were originated on or prior to July 31, 2024.\nThe term loans are not secured and are recorded at amortized cost, which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses. As of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, the net notes receivable balance for term loans to small businesses was $912 million and $757 million, respectively. The current portion is included in notes receivable held for investment and the long-term portion is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment to reserve for lifetime expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is determined based on our current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses, historical credit losses, estimates of recoveries, and future expectations as of each balance sheet date. We evaluate the creditworthiness of our term loan portfolio on a pooled basis due to its composition of loans with similar general credit risk and characteristics. Expected credit losses are measured based on a loss forecasting model and calculated by applying loss curves derived from loan level risk segment and term mixes, aggregated at monthly loan vintages. Expected credit losses are continually updated with actualized charge-offs in each month as they occur. The allowance is inherently subjective and requires management estimates. The methodologies are updated periodically to reflect factors such as actual loan performance, changes to assumptions, portfolio growth, credit policies, changes to our applicant base, and macroeconomic conditions. Factors taken into consideration in the methodology include historical performance, customer creditworthiness, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, and actual credit loss experience. We use empirical data and management judgment to estimate losses for new credit tests or products for which we do not have enough history. We make judgments about the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay, and current and future economic conditions. When available information confirms that the specific loans or portions thereof are uncollectible, identified amounts are charged off. Loans are charged off in accordance with our charge-off policy, as the contractual principal becomes 120 days past due or meets other charge-off policy requirements. Subsequent recoveries of the unpaid principal balance, if any, are subtracted from charge-offs to compute a net charge-off and are recorded to cost\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nof service revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. As of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, the allowances for credit losses, amount of charge-offs recorded, and amount of recoveries on term loans to small businesses were not material.\nWe consider a loan to be delinquent when the payments are one day past due. We place delinquent term loans on nonaccrual status and stop accruing interest revenue. Term loans are returned to accrual status if they are brought current or have performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and, in our judgment, will continue to make periodic principal and interest payments as per contractual terms. Past due amounts were not material for all periods presented.\nInterest revenue is earned on term loans originated and purchased and held for investment in accordance with the specified period of time and defined interest rate noted in the loan contract. Interest revenue is recorded net of amortized direct origination costs and is included in service revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. Interest revenue was not material for all periods presented.\nRefund Advance Loans. Refund advance loans are loans available to eligible TurboTax customers based on a customer's anticipated income tax refund, at no cost to the customer. The loans are repaid from the customer's income tax refund, which is generally received within three to four weeks after acceptance of the customer's income tax return by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We partner with a third-party issuing bank to originate the loans and subsequently purchase full participating interests in those loans. The refund advance loans are not secured and are recorded at amortized cost, net of an allowance for credit losses. As of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, the net notes receivable balance for refund advance loans were not material. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to reserve for potentially uncollectible loans. We estimate the allowance based on the expected funding of refunds by the IRS using historical trends. When we determine that any amounts are uncollectible, we write them off against the allowance. As of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on refund advance loans was not material.\nNotes Receivable Held for Sale\nTerm loans to small businesses. In August 2023, we entered into a forward flow arrangement with an institutional investor. Pursuant to this arrangement, we have a commitment to sell to the institutional investor a minimum of $250 million in participation interests in unsecured term loans purchased or made to small businesses over 18 months, subject to certain eligibility criteria. As of July 31, 2024, we have met the minimum commitment of the forward flow arrangement.\nNotes receivable held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value determined on an individual loan basis. To determine fair value, we utilize a cash flow methodology, taking into account estimated timing and expected selling prices. As of July 31, 2024, the balance of loans held for sale was $3 million and is included in notes receivable held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. Total sales of term loans during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 were $323 million. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, gains on sales of loans and servicing income were not material.\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\n__________________________\nNA = Not Applicable\nCapital in progress at July 31, 2024 and 2023, consisted primarily of costs related to various buildings and site improvements that have not yet been placed into service.\nAs discussed in Note 1, \u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Internal Use Software,\u201d we capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal use. We capitalized internal use software costs totaling $59 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024; $50 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2023; and\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\n$72 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2022. There was no capitalized labor in these amounts for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023. There was $13 million of capitalized labor in these amounts for the twelve months ended July 31, 2022. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to the computer software category.\nGoodwill\nChanges in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023 were as shown in the following table. Our reportable segments are described in Note 15, \u201cSegment Information.\u201d\nGoodwill is net of accumulated impairment losses of $114 million, which were recorded prior to July 31, 2022 and are included in our Consumer segment. The increases in goodwill during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023 were primarily due to acquisitions.\nAcquired Intangible Assets\nThe following table shows the cost, accumulated amortization, and weighted-average life in years for our acquired intangible assets at the dates indicated. The weighted-average lives are calculated for assets that are not fully amortized.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe following table shows the expected future amortization expense for our acquired intangible assets at July 31, 2024. Amortization of purchased technology is charged to amortization of acquired technology in our consolidated statements of operations. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets, such as customer lists, is charged to amortization of other acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of operations. If impairment events occur, they could accelerate the timing of acquired intangible asset charges.\nMailchimp\nOn November 1, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Mailchimp, a global customer engagement and marketing platform for growing small and mid-market businesses. We acquired Mailchimp to help deliver on the vision of an innovative, end-to-end customer growth platform for small and mid-market businesses. Mailchimp is part of our Small Business & Self-Employed segment. We have included the financial results of Mailchimp in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma information related to this acquisition has not been presented, as the effect of the acquisition on our consolidated results of operations was not material. Our results of operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2022 included $762 million of revenue attributable to Mailchimp. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2022, we recorded professional fees associated with the acquisition of $63 million in general and administrative expenses.\nThe fair value of the purchase consideration totaled $12.0 billion, which included $5.7 billion in cash and 10.1 million shares of Intuit common stock with a value of approximately $6.3 billion. The fair value of the stock consideration is based on the October 29, 2021 closing price of Intuit common stock of $625.99.\nPursuant to the equity purchase agreement, we also issued approximately 583,000 RSUs in substitution of outstanding equity incentive awards. These RSUs have a grant date fair value of $355 million and will be expensed over three years. Additionally, we issued approximately 325,000 RSUs with a total grant date fair value of $211 million to Mailchimp employees, of which $151 million will be expensed over four years and $60 million was expensed during the first six months following the acquisition date.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe allocation of the Mailchimp purchase price is as follows:\nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Mailchimp and the synergies expected to be achieved. This goodwill is assigned to the Small Business & Self-Employed segment and substantially all is deductible for income tax purposes. We completed the purchase price allocation for the Mailchimp acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, with no material adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation.\nIntangible assets consist of customer lists, purchased technology, and trade names/trademarks. We amortize purchased intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives. The weighted-average life of the total acquired identifiable intangible assets is 12.0 years. The following table presents the details of identifiable intangible assets acquired.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe carrying value of our debt was as follows at the dates indicated:\nFuture principal payments for debt at July 31, 2024 were as shown in the table below.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSenior Unsecured Notes\n2020 Notes. In June 2020, we issued four series of senior unsecured notes (together, the 2020 Notes) pursuant to a public debt offering. The proceeds from the issuance were $1.98 billion, net of debt discount of $2 million and debt issuance costs of $15 million. As of July 31, 2024, $1.5 billion of the 2020 Notes remained outstanding.\nInterest is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes under the effective interest method. We paid $20 million in interest on the 2020 Notes during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, $23 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2023, and $23 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2022.\nThe 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Upon the occurrence of change of control transactions that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the 2020 Notes, we will be required to repurchase the 2020 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 2020 Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the 2020 Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2020 Notes.\n2023 Notes. In September 2023, we issued four series of senior unsecured notes (together, the 2023 Notes) pursuant to a public debt offering. The proceeds from the issuance were $3.96 billion, net of debt discount of $20 million and debt issuance costs of $24 million, and were used, together with operating cash, to repay the outstanding balance on our unsecured term loan. As of July 31, 2024, $4.0 billion of the 2023 Notes remained outstanding.\nInterest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2023 Notes under the effective interest method. We paid $106 million in interest on the 2023 Notes during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024.\nThe 2023 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The indenture governing the 2023 Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the 2023 Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2023 Notes.\nUnsecured Credit Facilities\n2021 Credit Facility. On February 5, 2024, we terminated our amended and restated credit agreement dated November 1, 2021 (2021 Credit Facility). The 2021 Credit Facility included a $4.7 billion unsecured term loan that was repaid in September 2023, and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to mature on November 1, 2026. There were no amounts outstanding on the unsecured revolving credit facility at the time it was terminated.\nWe paid $42 million, $230 million, and $42 million in interest on the term loan during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Interest paid on the unsecured revolving credit facility was not material during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n2024 Credit Facility. On February 5, 2024, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on February 5, 2029 (2024 Credit Facility), which replaced the 2021 Credit Facility.\nUnder the 2024 Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain customary conditions, including approval of relevant lenders, on one or more occasions, increase commitments under the 2024 Credit Facility by an amount not to exceed $1 billion in the aggregate, and, on one or more occasions, extend the maturity date of the 2024 Credit Facility by one year. The 2024 Credit Facility includes a $500 million sublimit for borrowing swingline loans and a $250 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates equal to (a) in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125%, or (ii) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%, or (b) in the case of foreign currency borrowings, the interest benchmark for the relevant currency specified in the credit agreement plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%. Actual margins under either election are based on our senior debt credit ratings.\nThe 2024 Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the agreement, of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as measured on a rolling twelve month basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all required covenants. At July 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility. We paid no interest on this unsecured revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nCommercial Paper Program\nIn June 2024, we established a $1.5 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper). The maturities of the commercial paper may vary up to 397 days from the date of issuance. As of July 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under this program.\nSecured Revolving Credit Facilities\n2019 Secured Facility. On February 19, 2019, a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses (the 2019 Secured Facility). The 2019 Secured Facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. We have entered into several amendments to this facility, most recently on July 19, 2024. These amendments primarily increase the facility limit, extend the commitment term and final maturity date, and update the benchmark interest rate. Under the amended 2019 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $500 million, of which $300 million is committed and $200 million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at adjusted daily simple SOFR plus 1.5%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue interest at a rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through August 31, 2025, and the final maturity date is August 31, 2026. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all required covenants. At July 31, 2024, $285 million was outstanding under the 2019 Secured Facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 6.99%, which includes the interest on the unused committed portion. The outstanding balance is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary totaling $1.1 billion. Interest on the 2019 Secured Facility is payable monthly. We paid $20 million, $16 million, and $2 million in interest on this secured revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n2022 Secured Facility. On October 12, 2022, another subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses (the 2022 Secured Facility). The 2022 Secured Facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. We have entered into several amendments to this facility, most recently on April 30, 2024. These amendments primarily extend the commitment and final maturity date and increase the commitment amount. Under the amended 2022 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $500 million, of which $300 million is committed and $200 million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at SOFR plus 1.3%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue interest at a rate ranging from 0.2% to 0.4%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through April 30, 2026, and the final maturity date is April 30, 2027. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all required covenants. At July 31, 2024, $300 million was outstanding under the 2022 Secured Facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 6.68%. The outstanding balance is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary totaling $832 million. Interest on the 2022 Secured Facility is payable monthly. We paid $12 million and $4 million in interest on this secured revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated:\nOther Long-Term Obligations\nOther long-term obligations were as follows at the dates indicated:\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments.\nAnnual minimum commitments under purchase obligations at July 31, 2024 were as shown in the table below.\nWe lease office facilities under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Our facility leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and may contain escalation clauses and renewal options. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to 18 years, which include options to extend that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Some of our leases include one or more options to extend the leases for up to 10 years per option, which we are not reasonably certain to exercise. The options to extend are generally at rates to be determined in accordance with the agreements. Options to extend the lease are included in the lease liability if they are reasonably certain of being exercised.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nWe sublease certain office facilities to third parties. These subleases have remaining lease terms of up to 6 years, one of which includes an option to extend the sublease for up to 5 years.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\n(1) Includes short-term leases, which were not material for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to operating leases was as follows:\nOther information related to operating leases was as follows at the dates indicated:\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of July 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(1) Non-cancellable sublease proceeds for the fiscal years ending July 31, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, and thereafter of $7 million, $2 million, $2 million, $1 million, $1 million, and $1 million, respectively, are not included in the table above.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases was as follows at the dates indicated:\nAs of July 31, 2024, we have additional operating leases of $124 million for office facilities that have not yet commenced and therefore are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets nor in the tables above. These operating leases are expected to commence in fiscal year 2025 with lease terms ranging from nine to 10 years.\nThe provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the periods indicated:\nWe recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $183 million, $32 million, and $134 million in the provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe sources of income before the provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the periods indicated:\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nDifferences between income taxes calculated using the federal statutory income tax rate and the provision for income taxes were as follows for the periods indicated:\nThe state income tax line in the table above includes excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $30 million, $6 million, and $22 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nIn the current global tax policy environment, the U.S. and other domestic and foreign governments continue to consider, and in some cases enact, changes in corporate tax laws. As changes occur, we account for finalized legislation in the period of enactment.\nMaterial deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated:\nThe components of total net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets were as follows at the dates indicated:\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nWe have provided a valuation allowance related to California net deferred tax assets primarily related to state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards, foreign loss carryforwards, and state operating loss carryforwards that we believe are unlikely to be realized. We have a valuation allowance of $227 million and $235 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes decreased by $8 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024. The change in the valuation allowance was primarily related to a decrease in the allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards and state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards, net of an increase in the allowance for California net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes decreased by $9 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2023. The change in the valuation allowance was primarily related to a decrease in the allowance for foreign intangible deferred tax assets and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, net of an increase in the allowance for state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards.\nAt July 31, 2024, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $37 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2032. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.\nAt July 31, 2024, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $150 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $11 million and a valuation allowance of $6 million. The state net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in fiscal 2028. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.\nAt July 31, 2024, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $19 million which carry forward indefinitely. We maintain a full valuation allowance with respect to the foreign net operating losses as there is not sufficient evidence of future sources of taxable income required to utilize such carryforwards.\nAt July 31, 2024, we had California research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $335 million. The California research and experimentation credit will carry forward indefinitely.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods indicated:\nThe total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2024 was $327 million. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $210 million. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.\nWe file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdiction is the U.S. federal jurisdiction. For U.S. federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2021 except for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2016.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023 for the payment of interest and penalties were not material. The amounts of interest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, were also not material.\nWe offset a $66 million and $85 million long-term liability for uncertain tax positions against our long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, respectively. The long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2024 was primarily related to the government\u2019s approval of a method of accounting change request for fiscal 2018. The long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2023 was primarily related to the government\u2019s approval of a method of accounting change request for fiscal 2018 and a refund claim related to Credit Karma\u2019s alternative minimum tax credit that was recorded as part of the acquisition.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nStock Repurchase Programs and Treasury Shares\nIntuit\u2019s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $2.0 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024. At July 31, 2024, we had authorization from our Board of Directors for up to $1.9 billion in stock repurchases. On August 20, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the authorization under the existing stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $3 billion of our common stock. Future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nOur treasury shares are repurchased at the market price on the trade date; accordingly, all amounts paid to reacquire these shares have been recorded as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. Any direct costs to acquire treasury stock are recorded to treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.\nIn the past, we have satisfied option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting under our employee equity incentive plans by reissuing treasury shares, and we may do so again in the future. For all periods presented, we issued new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of the shares that we have repurchased in the past, and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares.\nDividends on Common Stock\nDuring the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, we declared cash dividends that totaled $3.60 per share of outstanding common stock, or approximately $1.0 billion. In August 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.04 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 10, 2024. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nDescription of 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and Credit Karma, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan\nOur stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. On January 18, 2024, our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (Restated 2005 Plan) that expires on January 18, 2034. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price, and other terms. We are permitted to issue up to 171.7 million shares under the Restated 2005 Plan, including 3,366,512 shares that were previously available for issuance prior to January 20, 2022 under the Credit Karma Plan, described below, adjusted for the fungible ratio of the Restated 2005 Plan. The plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each stock option granted on or after November 1, 2010 reduces the share reserve by one share and each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by 2.3 shares. Stock options forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Restricted stock awards and RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. Shares withheld for income taxes upon vesting of RSUs that were granted on or after July 21, 2016 are also returned to the pool of shares available for grant. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan and the Restated 2005 Plan typically vest over three to four years based on continued service and have a seven-year term. RSUs granted under those plans typically vest over three to four years based on continued service. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3, 2020, we assumed the Credit Karma, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (Credit Karma Plan), under which the assumed equity awards were granted. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, effective January 20, 2022, shares available under the Credit Karma Plan became available for grant under the Restated 2005 Plan and no shares may be granted out of the Credit Karma Plan.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThrough January 20, 2022, the Credit Karma Plan provided a fungible share reserve. Each restricted stock unit granted reduced the share reserve by one share. RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increased the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Shares withheld for income taxes upon vesting of RSUs were also returned to the pool of shares available for grant. After January 20, 2022, shares forfeited and returned to the pool from grants issued out of the Credit Karma Plan increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited.\nAt July 31, 2024, there were approximately 27.3 million shares available for grant under the Restated 2005 Plan and no awards may be granted out of the Credit Karma Plan.\nDescription of Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn November 26, 1996, our stockholders initially adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 25.8 million shares under the ESPP, which expires upon the earliest to occur of (a) termination of the ESPP by our Board of Directors, or (b) issuance of all the shares of Intuit\u2019s common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. Offering periods under the ESPP are six months in duration and composed of two consecutive three-month accrual periods. Shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the accrual period.\nUnder the ESPP, employees purchased 360,028 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024; 399,975 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2023; and 326,961 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2022. At July 31, 2024, there were 1,963,952 shares available for issuance under this plan.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense that we recorded in operating income for the periods shown.\nWe capitalized no share-based compensation related to internal use software projects during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, and $1 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2022.\nDetermining Fair Value\nValuation and Amortization Methods\nRSUs granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the service period. These time-based RSUs accounted for approximately 90% of our total share-based compensation expense during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established market or performance goals. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nthe intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. Each quarter, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the market price of our stock on the date of grant for dividends.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions, including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.\nExpected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option\u2019s remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by us.\nExpected Volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms.\nDividends. We use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. We paid quarterly cash dividends during all years presented and currently expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future.\nForfeitures. We adjust share-based compensation expense for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nWe used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and shares purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the periods indicated:\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nShare-Based Awards Available for Grant\nA summary of share-based awards available for grant under our plans for the fiscal periods indicated was as follows:\n(1)RSUs granted from the pool of shares available for grant under our Restated 2005 Plan reduce the pool by 2.3 shares for each share granted. RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant under the Restated 2005 Plan increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. Through January 20, 2022, shares granted from the Credit Karma Plan reduce the pool by one share for each share granted and shares forfeited and returned to the pool from the Credit Karma Plan increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Beginning January 20, 2022, shares forfeited and returned to the pool from the Credit Karma Plan increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. No shares were granted from the Credit Karma Plan after January 20, 2022.\n(2)Stock options and RSUs canceled, expired, or forfeited under our Restated 2005 Plan and Credit Karma Plan are returned to the pool of shares available for grant. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, shares withheld for income taxes upon vesting of RSUs that were granted on or after July 21, 2016 are also returned to the pool of shares available for grant. Stock options and RSUs canceled, expired, or forfeited under older expired plans are not returned to the pool of shares available for grant. Under the Credit Karma Plan, shares withheld for income taxes are also returned to the pool of shares available for grant.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nRestricted Stock Unit and Restricted Stock Activity\nA summary of RSU and restricted stock activity for the periods indicated was as follows:\n(1)This includes approximately 583,000 RSUs granted to employees of Mailchimp in substitution of outstanding equity incentive awards with a grant date fair value of $355 million and approximately 325,000 RSUs granted to employees of Mailchimp in connection with the acquisition with a grant date fair value of $211 million. See Note 7, \u201cBusiness Combinations.\u201d\nAdditional information regarding our RSUs is shown in the table below.\nAt July 31, 2024, there was $5.0 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs and restricted stock with a weighted-average vesting period of 2.9 years. We will adjust unrecognized compensation cost for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nStock Option Activity\nA summary of stock option activity for the periods indicated was as follows:\nInformation regarding stock options outstanding as of July 31, 2024 is summarized below:\nThe aggregate intrinsic values at July 31, 2024 are calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common stock for shares that were in-the-money at that date. In-the-money options at July 31, 2024 were options that had exercise prices that were lower than the $647.35 market price of our common stock at that date.\nAdditional information regarding our stock options and ESPP shares is shown in the table below.\nAt July 31, 2024, there was $131 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options with a weighted-average vesting period of 3.2 years. We will adjust unrecognized compensation cost for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nComprehensive income consists of two elements, net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) items are recorded in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets and excluded from net income. Our other comprehensive income (loss) consists of unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale and foreign currency translation adjustments for subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table shows the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets at the dates indicated.\nNon-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan\nIntuit\u2019s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan provides that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries and up to 75% of their bonuses. We have agreed to credit the participants\u2019 contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We do not guarantee above-market interest on account balances. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts, and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are unsecured and are general assets of Intuit. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants may elect to receive their payments in a lump sum or installments. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant\u2019s disability, death, or a change in control of Intuit. We made no employer contributions to the plan for any period presented.\nWe had liabilities related to this plan of $207 million at July 31, 2024, and $171 million at July 31, 2023. We have matched the plan liabilities with similar-performing assets, which are primarily investments in life insurance contracts. These assets are recorded in other long-term assets, while liabilities related to obligations are recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n401(k) Plans\nIn the United States, employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 50% of pre-tax compensation, subject to IRS limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 125% up to six percent of compensation, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts and IRS limitations.\nAdditionally, Credit Karma employees in the United States who participate in the Credit Karma 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 90% of pre-tax compensation, subject to IRS limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of Credit Karma employee contributions, currently 100% up to six percent of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts and IRS limitations.\nMatching contributions for both plans were $138 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024; $136 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2023; and $118 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2022.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nBeginning in May 2019, various legal proceedings were filed and certain regulatory inquiries were commenced in connection with our provision and marketing of free online tax preparation programs. We believe that the allegations contained within these legal proceedings are without merit and continue to defend our interests in them. These proceedings included, among others, a putative class action in the Northern District of California in September 2019 (the Intuit Free File Litigation). In August 2020, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that the putative class action claims be resolved through arbitration. In May 2021, the Intuit Free File Litigation was dismissed on a non-class basis after we entered into an agreement that resolved the matter on an individual non-class basis, without any admission of wrongdoing, for an amount that was not material. These proceedings also include a class action lawsuit that was filed in the Ontario (Canada) Superior Court of Justice on August 25, 2022.\nThese proceedings also included individual demands for arbitration that were filed beginning in October 2019. As of January 31, 2023, we settled all of these arbitration claims, without any admission of wrongdoing, for an amount that was not material. In June 2021, we received a demand and draft complaint from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and certain state attorneys general relating to the ongoing inquiries described above. On March 29, 2022, the FTC filed an action in federal court seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining certain Intuit business practices pending resolution of the FTC\u2019s administrative complaint seeking to permanently enjoin certain Intuit business practices (the FTC Actions). On April 22, 2022, the Northern District of California denied the FTC\u2019s requests for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. Beginning on March 27, 2023, a final hearing on the administrative action was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) at the FTC and, on August 29, 2023, the FTC\u2019s ALJ issued a decision in favor of the FTC and adverse to Intuit. On January 19, 2024, the FTC Commissioners affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision and issued a final order that requires us to adhere to certain marketing practices and does not contain any monetary penalties. On January 21, 2024, we filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and this appeal is pending. The FTC\u2019s order became effective on March 23, 2024, and is now pending review by the Court of Appeals. We intend to continue to defend our position on the merits of this case. However, the defense and resolution of this matter could involve significant costs. The state attorneys general did not join the FTC Actions, and, on May 4, 2022, we entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, admitting no wrongdoing, that resolved the states\u2019 inquiry, as well as actions brought by the Los Angeles City Attorney and the Santa Clara County (California) Counsel. As part of this agreement, we agreed to pay $141 million and made certain commitments regarding our advertising and marketing practices. We recorded this as a one-time charge in the quarter ended April 30, 2022, and paid the full amount to the fund administrator in the quarter ended January 31, 2023.\nIn view of the complexity and ongoing and uncertain nature of the outstanding proceedings and inquiries, at this time, we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible financial loss or range of financial loss that we may incur to resolve or settle the remaining matters.\nTo date, the legal and other fees we have incurred related to these proceedings and inquiries have not been material. The ongoing defense and any resolution or settlement of these proceedings and inquiries could involve significant costs to us.\nIntuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits, as well as demands, claims, government inquiries, and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Our failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business. We currently believe that, in addition to any amounts accrued, the amount of potential losses, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nWe have defined our four reportable segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. We define the chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Our chief operating decision maker organizes and manages our business primarily on the basis of service and product offerings.\nOn November 1, 2021, we acquired Mailchimp in a business combination. Our Mailchimp offerings are part of our Small Business & Self-Employed segment. The related revenue is primarily included within Online Services in the revenue disaggregation below. We have included the results of operations of Mailchimp in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.\nOn August 1, 2023, we reorganized certain technology functions in our Consumer and ProTax segments that support and benefit our overall platform. Additionally, certain workplace and real estate functions in our Small Business & Self-Employed segment are now managed at the corporate level. As a result of these reorganizations, costs associated with these functions are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we reclassified expenses totaling $49 million and $21 million from Small Business &\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSelf-Employed, $168 million and $150 million from Consumer, and $60 million and $64 million from ProTax to other corporate expenses, respectively.\nOn August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the end-to-end platform that customers use to grow and run their business.\nAll of our segments operate primarily in the United States and sell primarily to customers in the United States. Total international net revenue was approximately 8% of consolidated total net revenue in each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nWe include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, general and administrative, and non-employment related legal and litigation settlement costs, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items as part of other corporate expenses. For our Credit Karma reportable segment, segment expenses include certain direct expenses related to selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative. Unallocated corporate items for all segments include share-based compensation, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, professional fees and transaction charges related to business combinations, and restructuring charges.\nThe accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and acquired intangible assets, we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total assets by reportable segment. See Note 6, \u201cGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets,\u201d for goodwill by reportable segment.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe following table shows our financial results by reportable segment for the periods indicated.\n(1) Includes $25 million in share-based compensation expense associated with our restructuring plan for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024. See Note 16, \u201cRestructuring\u201d for more information.\nRevenue classified by significant service and product offerings was as follows:\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nIn July 2024, our management approved, committed to, and initiated a plan of reorganization (the Plan) focused on reallocating resources to our key growth areas. The Plan includes the exit of employees and the closing of real estate sites in certain markets in service to growing technology teams and capabilities in strategic locations. We expect the actions associated with the Plan to be substantially complete by the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Restructuring costs associated with the Plan are estimated to be approximately $247 million. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, we recorded a $223 million charge in connection with the Plan. This charge is primarily related to severance and employee benefits and is recorded to restructuring in our consolidated statements of operations. Any changes to the estimates of executing the Plan will be reflected in future results of operations.\nThe following table summarizes the activity for the Plan by segment.\nThe liability for restructuring charges is included in accrued compensation and related liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nIntuit Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents",

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Their report is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended July 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our CEO and CFO, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, no matter how well conceived and executed, a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. There are also limitations that are inherent in any control system. These limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes, and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
