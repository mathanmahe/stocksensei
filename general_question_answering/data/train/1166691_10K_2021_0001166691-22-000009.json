    "item_1": "Item 1: Business\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We were incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania in December 2001. Through our predecessors, we have developed, managed and operated cable systems since 1963. Through transactions in 2011 and 2013, we acquired NBCUniversal, and in 2018, we acquired Sky.\nWe present our operations in five reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the \u201cNBCUniversal segments\u201d); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we changed our presentation of the NBCUniversal segments to reflect a reorganized operating structure in our television and streaming businesses to a more centralized structure to optimize its content creation, distribution and monetization model. We also now include Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service (\u201cDTC streaming service\u201d), within the NBCUniversal segments. NBCUniversal previously reported its operations in four reportable business segments: Broadcast Television, Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks and Peacock was previously reported in Corporate and Other.\n2021 Consolidated Operating Results(a)\nRevenue Adjusted EBITDA\n(a)Charts exclude the results of NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other, Corporate and Other, and eliminations. 2021 consolidated operating results were impacted by COVID-19. Refer to our Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.\n\u2022Cable Communications: Consists of the operations of Comcast Cable, which is a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and other services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising.\n\u2022Media: Consists primarily of NBCUniversal\u2019s television and streaming platforms, including national, regional and international cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; and Peacock\n\u2022Studios: Consists primarily of NBCUniversal\u2019s film and television studio production and distribution operations.\n\u2022Theme Parks: Consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; Osaka, Japan; and Beijing, China.\n\u2022Sky: Consists of the operations of Sky, one of Europe\u2019s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks.\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives.\nFor developments in our business and financial and other information about our reportable business segments, refer to Item 7: Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nDescription of Our Businesses\nCable Communications Segment\nCable Communications offers broadband, video, voice, wireless, and other services in the United States individually and as bundled services at a discounted rate over our cable distribution system to residential and business customers. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services and from the sale of advertising. We aim to meet the needs of various segments of our residential customer base by offering multiple levels within each of our stand-alone and bundled services. Our business services offerings are tailored to meet the needs of various segments of our business customer base, ranging from broadband services for small business locations to bundled services and solutions designed to meet the needs of medium-sized customers and larger enterprises.\nCustomer Relationships and the Areas We Serve\nAll customer metrics included in this section are as of December 31, 2021.\n(in millions) December 31, 2021\nCustomer relationships\nResidential customer relationships 31.7\nBusiness services customer relationships 2.5\nTotal customer relationships 34.2\nHomes and businesses passed 61\nTotal customer relationships penetration of homes and businesses passed 57 %\nHomes and businesses are considered passed if we can connect them to our cable distribution system without further extending the transmission lines and are estimated based on the best available information.\nThe map below highlights Cable Communications\u2019 cable distribution footprint and the designated market areas (\u201cDMAs\u201d) where we have 250,000 or more customer relationships, with bolded locations representing one of the top 25 U.S. television DMAs as of December 31, 2021.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 2\nResidential\nBroadband - 29.6 million customers\nWe offer broadband services over our hybrid fiber-optic and coaxial cable network with downstream speeds up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint and fiber-based speeds that range up to 3 gigabits per second, and we continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future.\nWe also offer wireless gateways to customers that combine an internet modem with a Wi-Fi router to deliver reliable internet speeds and enhanced coverage through an in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi network as well as xFi Pod plug-in devices that extend a customer\u2019s in-home Wi-Fi coverage. Customers with wireless gateways may also personalize and manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home, and access advanced security technology and other features, with our xFi whole-home application and online portal. Broadband customers have access to our expanding network of secure residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots nationwide. As part of our low-income broadband adoption program, we also offer qualifying customers our Internet Essentials service, and beginning at the end of 2021 Internet Essential Plus, which have downstream speeds of up to 50 megabits per second and 100 megabits per second, respectively.\nBroadband customers that prefer consuming content over the internet rather than linear cable television are eligible to receive our Flex streaming device for no additional charge, which includes integrated search functionality and a voice-activated remote control. Flex also provides access to and the integration of streaming content from Peacock\u2019s premium tier; certain third-party internet-based apps providing content and music such as DTC streaming services Disney+ and Netflix; and certain pay-per-view and video on demand content available over the internet. We earn commission revenue from the sale of certain third-party DTC streaming services.\nVideo - 17.5 million customers\nWe offer a broad variety of video services, primarily through our X1 platform, which provides integrated search functionality and a voice-activated remote control. The integrated features provided by X1 operate across content in customers\u2019 cable video services packages and content from internet-based streaming services that customers may access in a manner similar to our Flex streaming device. Our video packages typically range from a basic cable service with access to between 20 and 65 channels to a full service with access to more than 300 channels. Customers may view programming live, record live programming through our digital video recorder (\u201cDVR\u201d) service or access our video on demand services with extensive programming choices such as television series, movies and special-events programming that are available for free or to rent or own digitally. These viewing options are also available through our mobile app and online portal.\nWe tailor our video packages based on particular programming preferences, demographics and geographic areas in accordance with applicable local and federal regulatory requirements, with programming generally inclusive of national broadcast networks, local broadcast stations, national and regional cable networks, government and public access programming, and premium channel subscriptions such as HBO and Showtime. We also offer packages with extensive amounts of foreign-language programming and other specialty tiers of programming.\nVoice - 9.1 million customers\nWe offer voice services using interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) technology that provide either unlimited or usage-based local and domestic long-distance calling, as well as options for international calling plans, voicemail, readable voicemail, nuisance call blocking tools and various other features.\nWireless - 4.0 million lines\nWe offer wireless services for handsets, tablets and smart watches using mobile virtual network operator (\u201cMVNO\u201d) rights over Verizon\u2019s wireless network, including its 5G technology and our existing network of secure residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots. Wireless services are only offered as part of our bundled service offerings to residential customers that subscribe to our broadband services and to eligible small business customers on similar terms. Customers may activate multiple lines per account and choose to pay for services on an unlimited data plan, shared data plans, or per gigabyte of data used. Customers may either bring their own device or purchase devices from us with the option to pay upfront or finance the purchase interest-free over 24 months.\nBusiness Services\nBusiness services customers may subscribe to a variety of products and services, including broadband services over our hybrid fiber-optic and coaxial cable network with downstream speeds up to a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint and fiber-based speeds that range up to 100 gigabits per second. Our service offerings for small business locations primarily include broadband services, as well as voice and video services, that are similar to those provided to our residential customers, cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and cloud-\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nbased services for file sharing, online backup and web conferencing, among other features. We also offer Ethernet network services, which connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options to medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and advanced voice services, as well as video solutions for hotels and other large venues. In addition, we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help manage their network bandwidth.\nOur business services offerings for medium-sized and enterprise customers also include a software-defined networking product, and larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These services are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations both within and outside of our cable distribution footprint, where we provide coverage outside of our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\nAdvertising\nWe generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells to local, regional and national advertisers as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, and we also generate revenue from selling advertising on our digital platforms. Our advertising business also represents the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets and offers additional technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences.\nOther\nOur security and automation services provide home monitoring services and the ability to manage other functions within the home, such as lighting and room temperature, through our online portal, mobile apps and the X1 platform. We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\nNetwork and Technology\nOur Cable Communications cable distribution system uses a hybrid fiber-optic and coaxial cable network that we believe is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities over time. This network provides the two-way transmissions that are essential to providing broadband services, interactive video services such as integrated search functionality, On Demand and DVR, voice services, and security and automation services. Leveraging DOCSIS 3.1 technology, Cable Communications currently deploys broadband services with downstream speeds for residential customers up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint. We continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future. Additionally, Cable Communications has been automating many core network functions in order to expand capacity and increase operating efficiency and to identify and fix network issues before they affect our customers.\nCable Communications continues to focus on technology initiatives to design, develop and deploy next-generation media and content delivery platforms, such as the X1 and Flex platforms and cloud DVR technology that use Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capability. These platforms are based on our global technology platform, which integrates linear television networks, certain owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other internet-based apps, and on demand content in one unified experience with voice-activated remote control search and interactive features. Cable Communications also pursues technology initiatives related to broadband services that leverage our global technology platform, providing customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our xFi whole-home application and online portal, advanced security technology and other features.\nSources of Supply and Other Operations\nTo offer video services, Cable Communications licenses substantial amounts of programming from cable and broadcast networks, as well as from local broadcast television stations. The fees associated with these programming distribution agreements are generally based on the number of subscribers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our On Demand service, online portal, mobile apps and Flex.\nFor wireless services, we have an MVNO agreement that allows us to offer services using Verizon\u2019s wireless network and we purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches that we sell to wireless customers.\nCable Communications purchases from a limited number of suppliers a significant amount of customer premise equipment, including wireless gateways and set-top boxes, network equipment and services to provide services to residential and business customers.\nCable Communications uses two primary vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 4\nCable Communications offers services directly to residential and business customers through customer service teams, retail stores, customer service centers, websites, door-to-door selling, telemarketing and third-party outlets, as well as through advertising via direct mail, television and the internet. Our customer service teams also provide 24/7 call-answering capability, telemarketing and other services. Our technical services group performs various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to our cable distribution system. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\nCompetition\nCompetition for Cable Communications\u2019 services consists primarily of telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks, DTC streaming and other over-the-top (\u201cOTT\u201d) service providers and direct broadcast satellite (\u201cDBS\u201d) providers that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours.\nResidential\nBroadband\nCable Communications competes with a number of companies offering internet services, including:\n\u2022wireline telecommunications companies\n\u2022wireless telecommunications companies\n\u2022municipal broadband networks and power companies\n\u2022satellite broadband providers\nCertain wireline telecommunications companies such as AT&T, Frontier, Lumen and Verizon have built and are continuing to build fiber-based network infrastructure farther into their networks, which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional DSL technology, and are offering services with these higher speeds in many of our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our broadband services.\nCertain companies have launched fiber-to-the-home networks that provide broadband services in certain areas in which we operate, and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiber-based networks.\nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of technologies, including 4G and 5G, wireless broadband and Wi-Fi networks. These networks work with devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and mobile and fixed wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. Moreover, broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint. The availability of these and other offerings could negatively impact the demand for our broadband services.\nVideo\nCable Communications competes with a number of different sources in the United States that provide news, sports, information and entertainment programming to consumers, including:\n\u2022DTC streaming and other OTT service providers including:\n\u25e6subscription-based services, such as Disney+ and Netflix, that offer online services that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming\n\u25e6virtual multichannel video providers, such as Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV, that offer streamed linear programming networks\n\u2022DBS providers, including DIRECTV and DISH Network, that transmit satellite signals to substantially all U.S. households to provide video programming and other information similar to our video services\n\u2022companies, including AT&T and Verizon, that have built and continue to build fiber-based networks that provide video services similar to ours, overlap a substantial portion of our service areas, and in some cases provide bundled offerings that include wireless phone services\n\u2022other providers that build and operate communications systems and services in the same areas that we serve, including those operating as franchised cable operators\n\u2022other companies, such as local broadcast television stations, that provide multiple channels of free over-the-air programming\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nMany of these competitors also have significant financial resources.\nVoice\nCable Communications competes with wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, including incumbent local exchange carriers (\u201cILECs\u201d) and competitive local exchange carriers (\u201cCLECs\u201d), and other internet-based and VoIP service providers. Certain wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, such as the ILECs AT&T and Verizon, have longstanding customer relationships, and extensive existing facilities and network rights-of-way. A few CLECs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources. In addition, we are increasingly competing with other telecommunications service providers as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internet-based phone services.\nWireless\nCable Communications competes with national wireless service providers in the United States, including AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, which offer wireless service on both a stand-alone basis or along with other services as bundled offerings, as well as regional wireless service providers.\nBusiness Services\nCable Communications primarily competes with a variety of wireline telecommunications companies, including ILECs and CLECs, and wide area network managed service providers. These companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier\u2019s network. We also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and VoIP companies that target businesses of all sizes.\nAdvertising\nCable Communications competes for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital, radio and print media. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by declines in audience ratings and television viewership and difficulty in measuring fragmented audiences. Cable Communications advertising is sold to local, regional and national advertisers, and competition is affected by the market conditions in the specific geographies in which we operate.\nNBCUniversal Segments\nNBCUniversal is one of the world\u2019s leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks in the United States and Asia.\nMedia Segment\nNBCUniversal\u2019s television and streaming platforms primarily comprise our Media segment, including:\n\u2022National, regional and international cable networks\n\u2022NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations\n\u2022Peacock, our DTC streaming service\nNBCUniversal distributes a wide variety of content to appeal to consumers with varying preferences across demographics and geographies through our portfolio of television networks and streaming platforms. This content includes programming owned by NBCUniversal and by third parties who license it to us for distribution.\nMedia segment revenue is primarily generated from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and digital properties, and from the distribution of our television and streaming platform programming.\nOur advertising sales are affected by the prices we charge for each advertising unit, which are generally based on the size and demographics of our viewing audiences, audience ratings on our television networks, the number of advertising units we can place in our programming and on our digital properties, and our ability to sell our advertising across our platforms.\nWe market and distribute cable network programming in the United States and internationally to multichannel video providers, including both traditional providers of linear programming and virtual providers who provide streaming services for linear programming. We also receive fees from multichannel video providers under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements and associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. Our programming distribution agreements are generally multiyear agreements with revenue based on the number of subscribers\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 6\nreceiving the programming and the fees charged per subscriber. Certain Peacock subscribers are also charged a monthly subscription fee.\nMedia generates other revenue from content licensing and from various digital properties.\nCable Networks\nWe operate a diversified portfolio of cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content.\nThe table below presents a summary of NBCUniversal\u2019s national cable networks and their advertising reach to U.S. households.\nCable Network Approximate U.S.\nHouseholds as of\nDecember 31, 2021\n(in millions)(a)\nDescription of Programming\nUSA Network 80 General entertainment and sports\nE! 79 Entertainment and pop culture\nSyfy 79 Imagination-based entertainment\nBravo 79 Entertainment, culture and arts\nMSNBC 79 News, political commentary and information\nCNBC 78 Business and financial news\nOxygen 70 Crime, mystery and suspense for women\nGolf Channel 66 Golf competition and golf entertainment\nUniversal Kids 53 Children\u2019s entertainment\nThe Olympic Channel 47 Olympic sports events and Olympic-themed original content\nUniverso 37 Spanish language entertainment\nCNBC World 29 Global financial news\n(a)Household data is based on information from The Nielsen Company as of December 31, 2021 using its Cable Coverage Universe Estimates report and dynamic ad insertion estimates. The Nielsen estimates include subscribers to both traditional and certain virtual multichannel video providers. The Nielsen estimates are not based on information provided by us and are included solely to enable comparisons between our cable networks and those operated by our peers. Information presented excludes approximately 79 million households receiving the NBC Sports Network as of December 31, 2021, which ceased operations in January 2022.\nOur regional sports and news networks together serve more than 21 million households across the United States, including in markets such as Baltimore/Washington, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Sacramento and San Francisco.\nBroadcast\nNBC\nThe NBC network features original entertainment, news and sports programming that reaches viewers in virtually all U.S. television households through more than 200 affiliated stations across the United States, including our 11 owned NBC local broadcast television stations. The NBC owned local broadcast stations include stations in 8 of the top 10 general markets and collectively reached approximately 35 million U.S. television households as of December 31, 2021, representing approximately 28% of U.S. television households. In addition to broadcasting the NBC network\u2019s national programming, local broadcast stations deliver local news, weather and investigative, and consumer reporting across multiple platforms.\nTelemundo\nThe Telemundo network, a Spanish-language broadcast network, features original entertainment, news, live specials and sports programming that reaches viewers in over 90% of all U.S. Hispanic television households through 82 affiliated stations, including our 30 owned Telemundo local broadcast television stations and our national feed. The Telemundo owned local broadcast stations include stations in all of the top 20 U.S. Hispanic markets and collectively reached approximately 73% of U.S. Hispanic television households as of December 31, 2021. In addition to broadcasting the Telemundo network\u2019s national programming, local broadcast stations deliver local news, weather and investigative, and consumer reporting across multiple platforms. We also own an independent Telemundo station serving the Puerto Rico television market.\nPeacock\nPeacock is a premium DTC streaming service that launched in 2020 and features NBCUniversal content including exclusive Peacock originals, current NBC and Telemundo shows, news, late-night comedy, live sports and a library of television shows and movies, that provides customers access to tens of thousands of hours of programming. Customers have the choice of three\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\ntiers of service: a free, ad-supported version; a subscription based, ad-supported version with access to all Peacock content; and a similar subscription-based, ad-free version. The Peacock app is available to consumers over the internet directly and through distributors and other platforms in the United States, including to Cable Communications X1 and Flex customers. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, certain ad-supported Peacock programming was also integrated into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\nProgramming\nOur television and streaming platforms include content licensed from our Studios segment and from third parties, as well as content produced by Media segment businesses, such as live news and sports programming and certain original programming, including late-night comedy for NBC and original telenovelas for Telemundo.\nWe have various multiyear contractual commitments for the licensing of programming, including contracts related to broadcast rights for sporting events. We generally seek to include in our sports rights agreements the rights to distribute content on one or more of our television networks and on digital platforms, including Peacock. Our most significant sports rights commitments include the following:\n\u2022NFL: Agreements to produce and broadcast a specified number of regular season and playoff games, including Sunday Night Football on our NBC network and four Super Bowl games, the next of which is in February 2022, through the 2033-34 season, with a termination right available to the NFL after the 2029-30 season. These agreements include certain other rights, including streaming rights, additional exclusive games on Peacock and the Spanish-language U.S. broadcast rights for certain NFL games, which are aired on Telemundo\n\u2022Olympics: U.S. broadcast rights for the summer and winter Olympic Games through 2032 with programming aired across the NBC network, multiple cable networks and on Peacock\nWe also have U.S. broadcast rights to PGA TOUR and other golf events through 2031, Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment (\u201cWWE\u201d) events through 2026, certain NASCAR events through 2024 and the Spanish-language U.S. broadcast rights to FIFA World Cup soccer games through 2026, as well as local broadcast rights for certain professional sports teams through our regional sports networks with terms ending between 2024 and 2040.\nStudios Segment\nNBCUniversal\u2019s film and television studio production and distribution operations primarily comprise our Studios segment.\nRevenue is generated primarily from licensing our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to cable, broadcast and premium networks and DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-per-view services provided by multichannel video providers and OTT service providers; from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters; and from the sale of owned and acquired content on DVDs and through digital distribution services. We also generate revenue from the production and licensing of live stage plays.\nFilm Studios\nOur film studios develop, produce, acquire, market and distribute filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the following names:\n\u2022Universal Pictures\n\u2022Illumination\n\u2022DreamWorks Animation\n\u2022Focus Features\n\u2022Working Title\nThe majority of our films are initially distributed for exhibition in movie theaters, while other titles are produced and distributed direct-to-video. Certain theatrical titles are also made available for viewing on demand following a shortened theatrical release window. After their initial release, we sell and license films globally through various methods. We license films, including titles following the theatrical release window and selections from our film library, to cable, broadcast and premium networks, to DTC streaming service providers, and to video on demand and pay-per-view services provided by multichannel video providers, including the Cable Communications and Sky segments. We also distribute films globally by selling them on DVDs and through digital distribution services.\nTheatrical revenue is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute, their acceptance by audiences, the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices and the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 8\npopularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is generally a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding licensing windows. Revenue from the sale of content on DVDs and through digital distribution services is significantly affected by the timing and number of our theatrical releases and the popularity of our content, as well as the timing of release dates.\nWe develop and produce films both alone and jointly with other studios or production companies, as well as with other entities. Films are marketed and distributed worldwide primarily through NBCUniversal\u2019s marketing and distribution operations. We also acquire distribution rights to films produced by third parties, which may be limited to particular geographic regions, specific forms of media or certain periods of time.\nOur film studios have entered into, and may continue to enter into, film cofinancing arrangements with third parties, including both studio and nonstudio entities, to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor. Investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film.\nIn connection with studio productions, we typically owe \u201cresiduals\u201d payments to individuals hired under collective bargaining agreements to work on productions, which are generally calculated based on post-theatrical or content licensing revenue. We also owe \u201cparticipations\u201d payments to creative talent, to third parties under cofinancing agreements and to other parties involved in content production, which are generally based on the financial performance of the content.\nTelevision Studios\nOur television studios develop and produce original content, including scripted and unscripted television series. NBCUniversal\u2019s television studios, branded as the Universal Studio Group, produces content under the following names:\n\u2022Universal Television\n\u2022Universal Content Productions\n\u2022Universal Television Alternative Studio\n\u2022Universal International Studios\nOur original content is primarily licensed initially to cable, broadcast and premium networks, as well as to DTC streaming service providers, including our Media segment. We also license content after its initial airing and license older television programs from our programming library, as well as sell owned and acquired content globally on DVDs and through digital distribution services. The production and distribution costs related to original television content generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial license, which means obtaining subsequent licenses following the initial license is critical to the content\u2019s financial success. Similar to our film studios, we typically owe residuals and participations payments in connection with television studio productions.\nTheme Parks Segment\nThe following Universal theme parks primarily comprise the Theme Parks segment:\n\u2022Universal Orlando Resort: Includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, and our water park, Volcano Bay, all of which are located in Orlando Florida. Universal Orlando also includes Universal CityWalk Orlando, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and features on-site themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest. We are developing an additional theme park at Universal Orlando named Universal\u2019s Epic Universe.\n\u2022Universal Studios Hollywood: Includes a theme park located in Hollywood, California and Universal CityWalk Hollywood.\n\u2022Universal Studios Japan: Includes a theme park located in Osaka, Japan.\n\u2022Universal Beijing Resort: Opened in September 2021 and includes a theme park located in Beijing, China, Universal Studios Beijing, as well as Universal CityWalk Beijing and on-site themed hotels. Universal Beijing Resort is owned by us and a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies (see Note 7).\nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks, including ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise, and from our consumer products business. Revenue for our theme parks generally depends on the overall environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on travel and other recreational activities. We also license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nThe themed elements in our rides, attractions, and merchandising are based on intellectual property in our Studios and Media segments and intellectual property licensed from third parties under long-term agreements.\nCompetition\nMedia\nOur Media segment competes for viewers\u2019 attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers, including cable, broadcast and premium networks; DTC streaming and other OTT service providers; local broadcast television stations; home entertainment products; video on demand and pay-per-view services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information.\nMedia competes for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations, digital platforms, and all other advertising platforms. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations, channels, or digital platforms. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\nOur television and streaming platforms compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other cable, broadcast and premium networks, DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, and local broadcast television stations. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost is significant.\nOur cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\nStudios\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences for our film and television content with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of our film and television studios primarily depends on the number of films and shows and episodes produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Our film and television studios also compete to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on premium networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\nTheme Parks\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. To help maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks, we have invested and continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing and Orlando.\nSky Segment\nSky is one of Europe\u2019s leading entertainment companies operating in six territories, including three of the largest pay television markets in Western Europe: the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. The majority of our revenue is derived from our direct-to-consumer business, which has 23.0 million customer relationships, and primarily involves the distribution of a wide array of video channels to both residential and business customers. We also offer broadband, voice and wireless services individually and as bundled services in select countries. We own a diverse portfolio of pay television channels that feature entertainment, news, sports and movies, which are included in our subscription video services and are also licensed through various distribution partnerships to third-party video providers to reach an additional 3 million households. We also generate revenue from the licensing of owned and licensed programming to third-party video providers and from the sale of advertising.\nDirect-to-Consumer\nVideo\nOur direct-to-home (\u201cDTH\u201d) video services are delivered primarily through a combination of both satellite transmission and broadband connections that are marketed under the Sky brand in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Austria. We\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 10\nalso offer a DTC streaming service providing video content over the internet that is marketed as NOW or Sky Ticket (\u201cNOW\u201d) in these countries, as well as in Switzerland.\nWe offer a variety of DTH video services, primarily through our Sky Q platform, where customers have access to a diverse selection of our owned channels, channels owned by third parties and local free-to-air public broadcasting channels, as well as certain ad-supported Peacock programming beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Sky Q platform includes integrated search functionality and a voice-activated remote control and offers integrated access to certain third-party internet-based apps providing content and music, such as DTC streaming services Disney+ and Netflix. Our service offerings are tailored by country, with separate packages offered in each market. Basic packages include over 100 pay television channels in the United Kingdom and Ireland, over 50 channels in Italy, and over 30 channels in Germany and Austria. Specialty tiers for children\u2019s, sports, movie and high-definition (\u201cHD\u201d) programming are available for additional fees. DTH customers may view programming live, record live programming through our DVR services or access our video on demand services with programming choices such as television series, movies and special-events programming that are available for free or to rent or own digitally. These viewing options are also available through our mobile app and online portal. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced DTH video services over a broadband connection to customers who purchase Sky Glass smart televisions. Refer to Corporate and Other for additional information on Sky Glass.\nOur NOW streaming service offers packages ranging from daily to monthly access to entertainment, sports and movies programming. The entertainment package includes our owned entertainment channels and a broad range of on demand programming series, including child-friendly on demand programming, as well as certain ad-supported Peacock programming beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The sports package provides access to our owned sports channels and the movie package includes access to a library of films.\nTelevision Channels\nWe operate a diversified portfolio of Sky-branded channels. Our owned channels include:\n\u2022Entertainment channels featuring premium content, including Sky Atlantic, Sky Max and Sky Showcase\n\u2022Premium sports channels under the Sky Sports brand, with a majority of channels dedicated to a specific sport, including European football\n\u2022Premium movie channels under the Sky Cinema brand, including family and children\u2019s movie channels\n\u2022Sky-branded free-to-air channels, including Sky News\nOther Services\nWe offer broadband and voice services in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy. We offer fiber-to-the-cabinet (\u201cFTTC\u201d), standard copper digital subscriber line (\u201cDSL\u201d) broadband and fiber-to-the-home (\u201cFTTH\u201d) services, with downstream speeds up to 500 megabits per second in the United Kingdom and up to 1 gigabit per second in Ireland and we offer FTTH and FTTC services in Italy, with downstream speeds up to 1 gigabit per second. We deploy wireless hubs to customers that combine an internet and voice modem with a Wi-Fi router to deliver reliable internet speeds and enhanced coverage through an in-home Wi-Fi network.\nWe offer wireless services for handsets and tablets in the United Kingdom using a combination of an arrangement to access network assets from Telef\u00f3nica and our own mobile core network. Customers may activate multiple lines per account, choose to pay for services on various gigabyte plans, roll data over three years and stream with unlimited data on Sky mobile apps. Customers may either bring their own device or purchase devices from us with the option to pay upfront or finance the purchase interest-free over periods ranging from 24 to 48 months.\nContent\nIn addition to including owned channels as part of our video services, we distribute some of our owned channels on third-party platforms through both wholesale arrangements and arrangements with partners who distribute our owned channels as agents to their respective customer bases. We also license owned and licensed content to third parties and Peacock. Additionally, through a partnership with ViacomCBS, we plan to launch SkyShowtime, a new DTC streaming service expected to be made available in select European markets starting in 2022.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nAdvertising\nWe sell advertising across our owned television channels and also represent the sales efforts of third-party channels. We also sell advertising on our digital platforms and offer various technology, tools and solutions relating to our advertising business.\nNetwork and Technology\nWe rely on various telecommunications providers to deliver video, broadband, voice and wireless services to our customers.\nFor a majority of customers, our DTH video platform is delivered via one-way digital satellite transmission that uses satellites leased from third parties for the distribution of television channels and is augmented by a set-top box with local DVR storage and high-speed, two-way broadband connectivity enabling interactive video services such as integrated search functionality, on demand, DVR and voice services. Our platform incorporates Wi-Fi connectivity for in-home distribution that allows wireless, multiroom consumption. We have also developed a range of back-end and client software applications that provide customers with access to our content across multiple third-party devices.\nUnder the current regulatory regime in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy, we are able to access networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers for a fee to provide our broadband, voice, and wireless services in many cases, on regulated terms. We offer broadband and voice services in the United Kingdom using a combination of our own core fiber network and BT Openreach\u2019s core and \u201clast mile\u201d network under a wholesale and fee-based arrangement and in Italy primarily using Open Fiber\u2019s network. We offer wireless services to customers in the United Kingdom using a combination of an arrangement to access network assets from Telef\u00f3nica and our own mobile core network .\nWe continue to focus on technology initiatives to design, develop and deploy next-generation media and content delivery platforms, including Sky Q and NOW, that deliver video content, provide advanced search capabilities, including through a voice-activated remote control, and provide access to and integration of certain other DTC streaming services. These platforms and, more recently, Sky Glass leverage our global technology platform. Sky Glass is a smart television that we launched in the fourth quarter of 2021 in the United Kingdom, with an operating system that provides a video service similar to Sky Q over a broadband connection, eliminating the need for a satellite dish or set-top box.\nSources of Supply and Other Operations\nProgramming\nOur owned television channels and NOW streaming service include content both owned by us and licensed from third parties and NBCUniversal. In some cases, licenses are on an exclusive basis. We have various multiyear contractual commitments for the licensing of programming, primarily sports rights and exclusive entertainment content. Our most significant sports rights commitments include European football broadcast rights for Premier League games through the 2024-25 season in the United Kingdom and Bundesliga games through the 2024-25 season in Germany. We also have broadcast rights to Formula One through 2024 in the United Kingdom and Germany and through 2022 in Italy, English and Wales Cricket Board cricket games through 2024 in the United Kingdom, and Union of European Football Associations Champions League (\u201cUCL\u201d) through the 2023-24 season in Italy, as well as non-exclusive broadcast rights to certain Serie A games through the 2023-24 season in Italy.\nOur most significant commitments for the licensing of film and television entertainment content include exclusive rights with HBO, Paramount, Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal. We also produce and air live news and sports programming and produce certain original programming through Sky Studios. We are increasingly creating and investing in original scripted content that is broadcast across all of our territories and sold to other markets. We also are constructing a new studio production facility in Elstree, U.K.\nTo offer video services, in addition to our owned channels, we license substantial amounts of programming from third parties. The fees associated with these programming distribution agreements are generally based on the number of customers that are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our on demand services, mobile apps and our NOW streaming service.\nOther\nWe purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant amount of customer premise equipment, including set-top boxes, wireless hubs and network equipment to provide our video and broadband services to residential and business customers. We also purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets and tablets that are sold to customers that receive our wireless services.\nWe offer direct-to-consumer services to residential and business customers through our customer service teams, customer service centers, websites, telemarketing, and a limited number of retail stores, as well as through advertising via direct mail,\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 12\ntelevision and the internet. Our home service group performs various tasks, including installations, servicing and upgrades of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\nCompetition\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services, we compete with cable operators, providers of both paid-for and free-to-air programming, other satellite television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other internet service providers and companies developing new technologies and devices. Our competitive position may be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\nWe compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations, digital platforms, and all other advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by declines in television viewership and the increasing number of entertainment choices available.\nCorporate and Other\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky\u2019s video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications\u2019 results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\nRevenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively. Revenue in Media also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World CupTM.\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nsignificant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters and as a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film\u2019s exhibition in movie theaters. Content licensing revenue also fluctuates due to the timing of when our film and television content is made available to licensees.\nRevenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Theme Parks generally experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the Christmas holiday season.\nSky\u2019s results are also impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our DTH and NOW streaming services, including the start of the new European football seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in higher net customer relationship additions and higher marketing expense in the second half of each year to attract new customers.\nExclusive sports rights, such as European football, play a key role within Sky\u2019s wider content strategy. In Europe, broadcasting rights for major sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality, although the staggered timing of major sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market. Certain of Sky\u2019s significant sports rights agreements require payments at the start of each season, resulting in increases in sports rights payments in the third and fourth quarters of each year.\nLegislation and Regulation\nWhile all of our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, with some also subject to international laws and regulations, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d), and Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulations and policies, affect significant aspects of our cable communications and broadcast businesses in the United States.\nBeyond the significant regulations summarized below, legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome, and they, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews, regarding our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete.\nLegislative and regulatory activity is increasing under the Biden Administration, particularly with respect to broadband networks. For example, Congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives, and may consider other proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new, permanent Open Internet/net neutrality requirements. Federal agencies likewise may consider adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband. States and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs. In addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws or enact new competition laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.\nThe following paragraphs summarize the more significant legal and regulatory requirements and risks affecting our businesses.\nCommunications-Related Regulations in the United States\nBroadband\nOur broadband services are subject to a number of regulations and commitments. The FCC frequently considers imposing new broadband-related regulations such as those relating to an Open Internet, and from time to time, imposing new regulatory obligations on internet service providers (\u201cISPs\u201d) such as us. States and localities also consider new broadband-related regulations, including those regarding government-owned broadband networks, net neutrality and connectivity during\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 14\nCOVID-19. New broadband regulations, if adopted, may have adverse effects on our businesses. We may also be subject to certain broadband-related commitments as a condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding.\nBroadband Deployment and Adoption Initiatives\nThere have been, and may continue to be, broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, that could subsidize other service providers building networks within our footprint or potentially could subsidize expansion of our network to new areas. We cannot predict how such funds will be awarded or the impact of these initiatives on our businesses.\nIn 2021, the FCC launched the federal Emergency Broadband Benefit (\u201cEBB\u201d) program to provide a monthly discount toward broadband service for eligible low-income households during the COVID-19 pandemic. Congress recently created the Affordability Connectivity Program (\u201cACP\u201d), a new longer-term program that replaced EBB. We participated in EBB and are participating in ACP. We cannot predict the extent to which eligible households will opt to use their ACP benefit towards our broadband services.\nOpen Internet Regulations\nVarious forms of Open Internet regulations can significantly affect our broadband services. In 2017, the FCC reversed its prior classification of broadband internet access service as a Title II \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under the Communications Act and classified it as an \u201cinformation service\u201d under Title I. In addition, it eliminated its prior \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules prohibiting ISPs from blocking access to lawful content on the internet; impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services (\u201cthrottling\u201d); prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration or in favor of an affiliate (\u201cpaid or affiliated prioritization\u201d); and generally prohibiting ISPs from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers\u2019 ability to access and use the lawful internet content, applications, services or devices of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging edge providers\u2019 ability to make lawful content, applications, services, or devices available to consumers (\u201cgeneral conduct standard\u201d). The FCC stated that jurisdiction to regulate ISP conduct would rest at the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and it expressly preempted all state Open Internet laws. In addition, the FCC revised the transparency rule to add a requirement that ISPs disclose any blocking and throttling practices, and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings. We have disclosed that we do not block, throttle, or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization, and have committed not to block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content. The FTC has authority to enforce these public commitments, and the FCC has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule.\nThe FCC\u2019s 2017 decision was challenged and, in 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia largely upheld the FCC\u2019s decision, including the classification of broadband as a Title I information service and repeal of its prior rules. However, it vacated the FCC\u2019s express preemption of all state Open Internet laws, but noted that state laws may nevertheless be preempted on a case-by-case basis if those regulations conflict with federal law or policy or under other theories and precedent on implied preemption.\nSeveral states have passed or introduced legislation, or have adopted executive orders, that impose Open Internet requirements in a variety of ways, and new state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future. Certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court. Such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create differing and/or conflicting state regulations.\nThe FCC under the Biden Administration likely will revisit the regulatory classification of broadband internet access service and reclassify it as a \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d which would authorize the FCC to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Under a Title II framework, the FCC could potentially regulate our customer rates, speeds, data usage thresholds or other terms for internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and internet content, applications and service providers, including backbone interconnection arrangements. Any FCC action could impact state Open Internet initiatives and related legal challenges, and also could prompt further litigation. Congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services. We cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed, the impact of potential new legislation, or the outcome of any litigation.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nMunicipally Owned Broadband Networks\nA number of local municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create government-owned networks, particularly in light of federal funding for broadband deployment. Certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of government-owned networks, although others may choose to ease or facilitate such networks. Much of the federal funding authorized in 2021 for broadband deployment is conditioned on states agreeing to make it available for potential use by government-owned networks, although the funding prioritizes deployment to unserved areas and locations. We cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our businesses.\nVideo\nThe video marketplace continues to become even more competitive, particularly with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. There are a number of laws and regulations that apply solely to multichannel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d) or cable operators such as our Cable Communications business, and to cable networks and local broadcast television stations operated by NBCUniversal. These laws and regulations can constrain our ability to compete, particularly against DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, which are not subject to these same requirements.\nCable Pricing and Packaging\nWhile our video services, including equipment and installation fees, are no longer subject to rate regulation by the FCC, certain state entities monitor and challenge in court the marketing and advertising of our services, and some have attempted to regulate the service packages we offer and our billing practices. We cannot predict the outcome of any current litigation with state entities or whether other states may pursue similar actions.\nCable Franchising\nCable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities. While the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, franchises typically last for a fixed term, obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality, customer service and other requirements, and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. Franchising authorities also may require adequate channel capacity, facilities and financial support for public, educational and governmental access programming, and other in-kind contributions.\nThe Communications Act also contains provisions governing the franchising process, including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal and unreasonable renewal conditions. We believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise. The FCC adopted an order in 2019 that prohibits state and local authorities from imposing duplicative franchise and/or fee requirements on the provision of broadband and other non-cable services over franchised cable systems and that ruled that in-kind contributions generally should be treated as franchise fees subject to a statutory cap on franchise fees of 5% of cable service revenue. While the order was upheld by a federal appellate court, that decision has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition, several localities have attempted, generally unsuccessfully to date, to impose franchise fees on DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\nProgram Carriage\nFCC regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its non-affiliation in the selection, terms or conditions for its carriage. In addition, cable operators and other MVPDs in the United States are prohibited from requiring as a condition of carriage a financial interest in, or exclusive distribution rights for, a video programming network. We have been involved in program carriage disputes at the FCC, as well as in the courts, and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 16\nProgram Access\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing MVPDs. The FCC and Congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with MVPDs and potentially with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. We currently offer our cable networks on a packaged basis (in \u201ctiers\u201d) and, in various cases, individually. We have been involved in program access disputes at the FCC and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\nMust-Carry/Retransmission Consent\nCable operators are required to carry, without compensation, programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations. As an alternative to this \u201cmust-carry\u201d requirement, local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for \u201cretransmission consent,\u201d under which the station gives up its must-carry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator, which frequently will involve payments to the station. We currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations\u2019 broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. Failure to reach a retransmission consent agreement with a broadcaster could result in the loss of popular programming on our video services.\nWith respect to our broadcast television business, every three years, each local commercial broadcast television station must elect for each cable system in its DMA either must carry or retransmission consent. A similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers. For the three-year period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023, all of our owned NBC and Telemundo local broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent. Although we have reached retransmission consent agreements with almost all MVPDs in the past, there can be no assurance that we will always be able to renew those agreements under favorable terms or at all.\nBroadcast Licensing\nLocal broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time, which may be renewed with or without conditions. The FCC renewed all of our broadcast television station licenses without conditions during the last license renewal cycle; the current television license renewal cycle began in 2020 and some of our licenses have been renewed. Although our licenses have been renewed in prior cycles, there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants.\nBroadcast Ownership Restrictions\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations impose certain limitations on local and national television ownership, as well as limits on foreign ownership in a broadcast television station. Some of these limitations currently are under review at the FCC, including the national television ownership limit, the local television ownership limit, and the prohibition on each of the four major broadcast television networks, ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, from being under common ownership or control with another of the four.\nChildren\u2019s Programming\nUnder federal regulations, the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks, broadcast networks and local broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children 12 years of age and under is limited, and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under.\nFCC 5G Spectrum Proceedings\nThe FCC also has established or is in the process of evaluating and potentially modifying its rules to make available additional spectrum that will likely be used for licensed and unlicensed commercial services, including new 5G services, some of which has been or is in the process of being auctioned by the FCC. Because Cable Communications and NBCUniversal both use some of this spectrum to provide services, they must transition their operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for 5G, which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs.\nVoice\nWe provide voice services using VoIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information, local number portability duties and benefits, disability access, E911, law enforcement assistance, outage reporting, Universal Service Fund contribution obligations, rural call completion, customer equipment back-up power, robocall\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nmitigation, service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements. The FCC has not yet ruled on whether VoIP services such as ours should be classified as an \u201cinformation service\u201d or a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under the Communications Act. The classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services. One federal court of appeals in the 8th Circuit has held that VoIP is an information service and preempted state regulation of VoIP, and the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to review that determination, but that ruling remains limited to the seven states located in that circuit. State regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of VoIP remains unsettled at the federal level.\nWireless\nWe offer a wireless voice and data service using our MVNO rights to provide the service over Verizon\u2019s wireless network. MVNOs are subject to many of the same FCC regulations as facilities-based wireless carriers (e.g., E911 services, local number portability, etc.), as well as certain state or local regulations. The FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile broadband providers in the future, which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally.\nInternational Communications-Related Regulations\nSky and certain NBCUniversal international businesses are subject to telecommunications and media-specific regulation described below in Europe, Latin America and other international jurisdictions, and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws, such as competition, consumer protection, data protection and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate. Our international businesses are currently, and may be in the future, subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Sky, we have made certain legally binding commitments with respect to Sky\u2019s operations, including for example, to maintain annual funding for Sky News in an amount no lower than Sky News\u2019 2017 fiscal year expenditures, as adjusted by inflation, until 2029.\nPlatform Services\nIn the United Kingdom, Sky is required to ensure that agreements to provide its electronic program guide (\u201cEPG\u201d) and conditional access (\u201cCA\u201d) services to other programming providers are on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, among other things, so that those providers\u2019 content is available on Sky\u2019s satellite platform via the EPG on set-top boxes. Sky also has voluntarily committed to the United Kingdom\u2019s communications regulator, the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, to provide access control services to third parties that enable them to provide interactive services. Sky is subject to similar EPG and CA obligations in Germany.\nTelevision Channels and On-Demand Services\nSky and NBCUniversal hold a number of licenses and authorizations for their portfolios of television channels and on-demand services. For example, in the United Kingdom, Sky\u2019s channels are licensed and subject to various codes issued by Ofcom affecting the content and delivery of these channels. Sky and NBCUniversal also hold various broadcast licenses in certain E.U. and other countries. These content-related rules and regulations cover issues such as the acquisition and exploitation of sports rights, media concentration and plurality, television advertising, the protection of children, accessibility, airtime for commercials and teleshopping, sponsorship and ensuring clear distinctions between program content and advertising.\nBroadband and Voice\nSky provides broadband and voice services in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy pursuant to wholesale distribution agreements that third-party broadband and telecommunications companies either make available commercially or are required to make available under applicable laws in those jurisdictions. Material changes to these regulations could affect Sky\u2019s business. As a provider of broadband services, Sky is subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to telecommunications security, including a U.K. law that requires providers to take certain measures with respect to potential security compromises. Sky is also subject to E.U. and other Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, which prohibit the blocking, throttling or discrimination of online content, applications and services and require ISPs to disclose their traffic management, throughput limitations and other practices impacting quality of service in customer contracts.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 18\nOther Areas of Regulation\nIntellectual Property\nCopyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary-rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, counterfeit DVDs and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal protections exist to combat such practices, the extent of copyright protection is sometimes ambiguous and the use of technological protections can be controversial. Modifications to existing laws, a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of existing laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\nU.S. copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. We also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute. The cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition, the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing, and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\nPrivacy and Data Security Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of consumers\u2019 personal information. In the United States, the Communications Act generally restricts cable operators\u2019 nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers\u2019 personally identifiable information, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests. We are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services.\nThe FTC generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices. For example, the FTC often partners with state attorneys general to enforce transparency requirements regarding the collection and use of consumer information. These enforcement efforts may require ongoing review on our part of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required in connection with the collection, use or sharing of personal information. We are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and under.\nIn addition, certain states have enacted detailed laws establishing explicit consumer privacy protections and data security requirements in their respective states. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) gives California residents rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use and sharing of \u201cPersonal Information,\u201d as well as rights to access, delete and restrict the sale of certain personal information collected about them. Moreover, all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the United Kingdom\u2019s Data Protection Act 2018 (\u201cDPA\u201d), which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom, respectively. DPA, GDPR and the Member States\u2019 legislation implementing the GDPR, related rules regulating the privacy of electronic communications services and networks (including \u201ccookie\u201d rules), and various initiatives by regulatory authorities pursuant to these laws affect how we are able to process certain personal data for particular purposes, what we must tell our customers about this processing, and what controls our customers have over such processing.\nPrivacy and data security remained a priority legislative issue in 2021. For example, new laws have been enacted in Virginia and Colorado, which come into effect in 2023 and include many requirements similar to those in the CCPA for companies that collect personal information from consumers in those states. In addition, California voters approved a ballot initiative enacting the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which updates the CCPA and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to oversee implementation and enforcement of the state\u2019s privacy laws. Changes enacted in the CPRA generally go into\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\neffect on January 1, 2023, though several aspects of the law remain subject to further rulemaking. Legislation similar to the laws enacted in Virginia and Colorado is under consideration in many other states, and various regulatory authorities are considering rulemakings around privacy and data collection. We cannot predict how these changes to the laws will affect our business, or whether any legislation or proposed rules currently under consideration will be enacted or adopted or what the impact of any such laws or regulations may be on our businesses.\nState and Local Taxes\nSome U.S. states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing, through both legislative and administrative channels, new or additional taxes or fees on, or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by, the businesses operated by our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes, fees, incentives or credits are computed, earned or monetized. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments. In some situations, DBS providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a broadband connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these DBS providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (\u201cITFA\u201d) prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges; however, some jurisdictions may challenge the ITFA or the application of the ITFA to our business, or may assert that certain taxes akin to right-of-way fees are not preempted by the ITFA.\nU.K. Exit from the European Union\nThe telecommunications and media regulatory framework applicable to our business in the United Kingdom is subject to greater uncertainty as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. In 2021, the U.K. government signaled its intention of moving away from the E.U.\u2019s approach in a number of policy areas, increasing the possibility of greater divergence between the regulation of our U.K. business and our other European businesses over time. We are not able to predict the extent of any such divergence at this point in time.\nOther Regulations\nU.S. states and localities, and various regulatory authorities, actively regulate other aspects of our businesses, including our Studios and Theme Parks businesses, accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities, customer service standards, inside wiring, cable equipment, pole attachments, universal service fees, regulatory fees, public safety, telemarketing, leased access, indecency, loudness of commercial advertisements, advertising, political broadcasting, sponsorship identification, Emergency Alert System, equal employment opportunity and other employment-related laws, environmental-related matters, our equipment supply chain, and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various similar regulations, including those that cover television broadcasting, programming and advertising. We are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities, which can result in us having to pay fines or being subject to other sanctions.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 189,000 full-time and part-time employees calculated on a full-time equivalent basis. Of these employees, approximately 79,000, 74,000 and 34,000 were associated with Cable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky, respectively. Approximately 30% of these employees were located in over 30 countries outside the United States, with larger workforce concentrations in the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Italy and Germany. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business. A small overall portion of our full-time U.S. employees are unionized; outside the United States, employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association. Our employee numbers reflect additional employees in our theme parks both due to the opening of our park in Beijing, China and reversing temporary workforce reductions implemented in 2020 due to capacity restrictions and closures at our parks resulting from COVID-19.\nOur company has been built on a foundation of respect, integrity and trust, and we are committed to creating and fostering a work environment that promotes those values. As a global media and technology company, we have a wide range of employees, including management professionals, technicians, engineers, call center employees, theme park employees, and media talent and production employees. Given the breadth of our employee base, we tailor our human capital management policies with a view to specific employee populations within our businesses. Some of our key workforce-related programs and initiatives include the following:\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 20\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\u2022Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is longstanding. We believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive company helps to foster creativity, innovation and success. We embrace diversity of background, perspective, culture and experience throughout our business.\n\u2022We offer a variety of training programs and initiatives focused on creating a more inclusive workplace culture. These efforts include company-wide forums like our diversity, equity and inclusion speaker series which is designed to educate, inspire dialogue and foster employee engagement through a curated experience anchored by scholars, authors, thought leaders and expert speakers focusing on a variety of diversity, equity and inclusion topics.\n\u2022We support nine employee resource groups, with 35,000 members in over 200 chapters, including a variety of uniquely tailored mentorship programs across our business.\nEmployee Engagement\n\u2022We seek to create an engaged workforce through proactive listening and constructive dialogue, including through employee engagement surveys, as well as through the employee resource groups described above.\n\u2022We have an open door policy and culture so employees can report any questions or concerns - whether involving a workplace issue, a concern about suspected illegal or unethical conduct or any other matter - trusting that we will take their concerns seriously and without fear of retaliation.\nTalent Development\n\u2022We provide a wide variety of opportunities for professional growth for all employees with in-classroom and online trainings and on-the-job experience.\n\u2022We offer education tuition assistance to full-time employees in the United States.\n\u2022Our Board of Directors discusses succession planning for our CEO and the remainder of our senior executive management team at least once a year. Throughout the year, our senior executive management team, as well as a broader array of executives throughout our businesses, make presentations to the Board and its committees and interact with our directors informally outside of regularly scheduled Board meetings, which provides directors with meaningful insight into our current pool of talent, what attracts and retains our executives, and our company culture.\nHealth and Welfare Benefits\n\u2022We offer a portfolio of services and tools to support our employees\u2019 health and well-being (including dedicated health assistants, expert medical opinion services, diabetes treatment programs, tobacco cessation, and others).\n\u2022In 2021, we enhanced benefits related to virtual care, telehealth options, and back-up family care resources and support services and launched new behavioral health and counseling tools to support emotional wellbeing.\n\u2022We provide female and male employees the same paid parental leave options, including for adoption and surrogacy, and provide specialized support teams to help manage first months of parenthood.\n\u2022In response to COVID-19, we completed hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 tests, made physician-directed COVID-19 screening, testing, vaccination and treatment available at no out-of-pocket cost to benefit-enrolled employees and their dependents and we hosted onsite vaccine clinics.\nFinancial Benefits\n\u2022We focus on attracting and retaining employees by providing compensation and benefits packages that are competitive within the applicable market, taking into account the job position\u2019s location and responsibilities.\n\u2022We provide competitive financial benefits such as a 401(k) retirement plan in the United States with a company match and other retirement arrangements internationally.\n\u2022We have employee stock purchase plans in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland and several other European countries where most of our full-time and part-time employees can purchase our stock at a discount.\n\u2022We generally grant awards of restricted stock units and stock options on an annual basis to a meaningful portion of our employees, with over 18,000 employees receiving such awards in 2021.\n\u2022We offer financial literacy training and counseling to support employees in making their own financial decisions.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nAvailable Information and Websites\nOur phone number is (215) 286-1700, and our principal executive offices are located at One Comcast Center, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to such reports filed with or furnished to the SEC under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), are available free of charge on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.comcastcorporation.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the SEC. The information posted on our websites is not incorporated into our SEC filings.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company\u2019s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d by words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d or \u201ccontinue,\u201d or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and in other reports we file with the SEC.\nAdditionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and, particularly in view of new technologies, the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any of such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.\nThe impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. In particular, COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations. For example, as a result of COVID-19, we have at times temporarily closed our theme parks or operated them with capacity restrictions. The creation and availability of our film and television programming globally also have been disrupted as a result of COVID-19, such as postponements or cancellations of sporting events, theatrical closures and suspensions of entertainment content production.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our businesses also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect day-to-day life, travel protocols and the length of time that such measures remain in place, global economic conditions, current and new variants and vaccination rates and efficacy. It is difficult to predict the extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected.\nCOVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.\nAll of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services as well as entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 22\nBelow is a summary of the most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the \u201cCompetition\u201d discussion within that section.\n\u2022Cable Communications\u2019 and Sky\u2019s broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks and DBS and newer satellite broadband providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint. Competition for Cable Communications\u2019 video services consists primarily of DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, DBS providers and telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks. Sky faces competition for its video services from cable and telecommunications providers in its European markets. Our voice and wireless services primarily compete with wireless and wireline telecommunications providers. Many of our competitors offer customers bundled products and services with favorable pricing, which has increased competition.\n\u2022NBCUniversal and Sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, popular content (including sports programming) and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers.\nConsolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services.\nThe ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.\nChanges in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications\u2019 video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal\u2019s television networks decrease, even as Cable Communications\u2019 broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.\nFor example, Cable Communications continues to experience net video customer losses. In Europe, more of Sky\u2019s new video customers have recently subscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to NOW, Sky\u2019s DTC streaming service, instead of its traditional DTH video service. Although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms, Flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at Sky and Cable Communications, and by offering Peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.\nThe increase in DTC streaming and other OTT service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership, and coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers through their own apps or platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky\u2019s television channels or to Peacock.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\nA decline in advertisers\u2019 expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\nCable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, websites and search engines, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, or economic conditions generally. In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal\u2019s networks and some of Sky\u2019s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of Peacock. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\nProgramming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications\u2019 video businesses.\nWe expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Cable Communications segment and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. Part of Cable Communications\u2019 programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers\u2019 rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment\u2019s results of operations.\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of Cable Communications\u2019 video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\nNBCUniversal and Sky create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.\nNBCUniversal and Sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. We also may be unable to license popular third-party content for NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s television programming channels if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors,\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 24\nincluding the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses may be adversely affected.\nThe loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to NBCUniversal\u2019s cable television networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers. In addition, NBCUniversal\u2019s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. Our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers, either \u201cmust-carry\u201d status, in which we require the provider to carry the station without generating any compensation to us, or \u201cretransmission consent,\u201d in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to us by such provider. Sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers.\nIncreasingly, NBCUniversal and Sky license their prior season and library content on third-party distribution platforms, including to DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. If this programming does not attract sufficient viewers, these providers may not distribute NBCUniversal\u2019s or Sky\u2019s programming. In addition, at times we have opted to, and expect that we may in the future, not license certain popular owned content to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through Peacock, which would result in foregone licensing revenue.\nFor all of these types of arrangements, NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s ability to renew agreements on favorable terms may be affected by industry consolidation and new participants entering the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms. The inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses.\nLess favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky\u2019s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky\u2019s businesses.\nSky relies on various third-party telecommunications providers to deliver its video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, under the current regulatory regimes in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy, Sky accesses networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers to offer its broadband and phone services, in many cases, on regulated terms, including price. If there is a change in regulation in these markets, the regulated terms could become less favorable. Moreover, while Sky receives wholesale fiber access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, specific pricing terms are not regulated. As a result, if Sky is only able to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on less favorable terms, it would adversely affect Sky\u2019s ability to compete, and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, Sky may be unable to deliver certain of its services to customers in one or more of the markets in which it operates, which would adversely affect Sky\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOur businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our business operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses, and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.\nPiracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal\u2019s businesses, and certain entities may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying us any compensation. It also presents similar challenges for Sky\u2019s businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.\nWe may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.\nWe depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. For example, global supply chains in general have been, and may continue to be, disrupted as a result of COVID-19. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or any other supply chain compliance-related issues, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.\nOur businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.\nOur success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors\u2019 use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. New technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways, including affecting the demand for our products, the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies. In addition, some companies and U.S. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. We expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 26\ncould be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of Flex and Sky Q set-top boxes, wireless gateways, developing smart televisions using our technology platform, and the operation of Peacock. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors\u2019 product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.\nA cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those that are related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are constant attempts by third parties to cause systems-related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. These incidents include computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malicious social engineering, and other malicious activities. Incidents also may be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns and vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.\nCyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies across the world and create latent vulnerabilities in our and third-party vendors\u2019 systems and other technologies. Moreover, as we also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third party vendors who agree to protect it, we face the risk that this information may become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information. Due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. We also incorporate third-party software (including extensive open-source software), applications, and data hosting and cloud-based services into many aspects of our products, services and operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks on such third-party suppliers and service providers.\nWhile we develop and maintain systems, and operate extensive programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. The occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents have in the past, and could in the future, cause a variety of potential adverse business impacts. These include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our or our customers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 data, equipment and reputation. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. In addition, any such events could lead to litigation or cause regulators in the United States and internationally to impose significant fines or other remedial measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\nWeak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers\u2019 discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of Cable Communications\u2019 or Sky\u2019s services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming and other OTT services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. In particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions (as well as natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks (such as COVID-19), terrorist attacks or other similar events).\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, could increase the cost of our borrowings and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\nAcquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\nFrom time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, such as Peacock. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. Additionally, federal regulatory agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; political risks; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. Sky\u2019s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the United Kingdom\u2019s recent withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\nNatural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nOur services, products and properties are vulnerable to damage from the occurrence of certain events, including natural disasters, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires, and a range of other unforeseeable events such as infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Such events have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, a reduction in demand for our products, services and theme parks, disruption of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and damage to our or our customers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 equipment and properties. These events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties, products and services and could lead to litigation and fines, including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. We expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\nThe loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nWe rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 28\ncandidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses.\nIn addition, NBCUniversal and Sky depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Governance Matters\nWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.\nWhile all of our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, compliance with certain laws and regulations is most material with respect to our Cable Communications and broadcast television businesses in the United States. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate.\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome, and they, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete.\nLegislative and regulatory activity is increasing under the Biden Administration, particularly with respect to broadband networks. For example, Congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives, and may consider other proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new, permanent Open Internet/net neutrality requirements. Federal agencies likewise may consider adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband. States and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs. In addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws or enact new competition laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.\nFailure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the \u201cLegislation and Regulation\u201d discussion within that section.\nUnfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.\nWe are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, free speech, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. Greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.\nLabor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.\nMany of NBCUniversal\u2019s writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversal\u2019s\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\ncollective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.\nIn addition, NBCUniversal\u2019s Media segment and Sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.\nOur Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.\u2019s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium.",

For more information about our company\u2019s operations and the risks facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2021, and all amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Refer to Item 7: Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, with the exception of the discussion and analysis related to our NBCUniversal segments, which is included below for all periods based on the updated segment structure.\nOverview\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the \u201cNBCUniversal segments\u201d); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment.\nConsolidated Revenue, Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation and Adjusted EBITDA(a)\n(in billions)\nRevenue Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation Adjusted EBITDA\n(a)Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Refer to the \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure\u201d section on page 52 for additional information, including our definition and our use of Adjusted EBITDA, and for a reconciliation from net income attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA.\n2021 Developments\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:\nCable Communications\n\u2022Revenue increased 7.1% to $64.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2% to $28.1 billion primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and technical and product support expenses.\n\u2022Operating margin increased from 42.1% to 43.7%.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 34\n\u2022Total customer relationships increased by 1.1 million, total broadband customers increased by 1.3 million, total wireless lines increased by 1.2 million and total video customers decreased by 1.7 million.\n\u2022Capital expenditures increased 4.9% to $6.9 billion, reflecting increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions, partially offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment and support capital.\nNBCUniversal\n\u2022Total NBCUniversal revenue increased 26.1% to $34.3 billion and total NBCUniversal Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.0% to $5.7 billion.\n\u2022Media segment revenue increased 20.3% to $22.8 billion and Adjusted EBITDA decreased 18.0% to $4.6 billion, including the impact of our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, revenue in the Media segment increased 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n\u2022Media segment results include the operations of Peacock, which in 2021 generated revenue of $778 million and operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion, compared to revenue of $118 million and operating costs and expenses of $781 million in 2020. We continued to invest in content and grow our customer base during 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced certain ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\u2022Studios segment revenue increased 16.2% to $9.4 billion, due to increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue and home entertainment and other revenue as our film and television production operations returned to full capacity. Studios revenue included licenses of content to our Media and other segments, including the impact of a new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock in 2021, and the impacts of initial content licenses associated with the launch of Peacock in 2020, which are eliminated in consolidation.\n\u2022Theme Parks segment revenue increased 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the operation of our theme parks in the current year period compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period and the opening of our theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\nSky\n\u2022Revenue increased 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue increased 3.1% due to increases in advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, partially offset by a decrease in content revenue, which were affected by COVID-19 in the prior year period and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA increased 20.8% to $2.4 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.2% primarily due to increases in revenue and decreases in programming and production expenses, partially offset by increases in direct network costs and other expenses.\nOther\n\u2022Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA losses decreased from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year period in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses.\n\u2022Resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021. We repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion in 2021. Raised our dividend by $0.08 to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis in January 2021 and paid $4.5 billion of dividends in 2021.\n\u2022Reduced debt by $8.9 billion in 2021 and ended the year with $94.8 billion of total short-term and long-term debt and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\nImpacts of COVID-19\nCOVID-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways, with the most significant effects in 2020, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nimpact will depend on restrictive governmental measures, U.S. and global economic conditions, expanded availability and acceptance of vaccines and consumer behavior in response to COVID-19. The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\nNBCUniversal\n\u2022Our theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood operated without capacity restrictions, following periods with capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted and we cannot predict if our parks will remain open or be subject to capacity restrictions, or the level of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n\u2022Delays to the start of seasons for certain professional sports leagues, including the 2020-21 NHL and NBA seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n\u2022Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity operations of many movie theaters worldwide caused by COVID-19. Delays in theatrical releases affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows. Results of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\nSky\n\u2022Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers\u2019 locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 36\nConsolidated Operating Results\nYear ended December 31 (in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 2019 % Change\n2020 to 2021 % Change\n2019 to 2020\nRevenue $ 116,385 $ 103,564 $ 108,942 12.4 % (4.9) %\nCosts and Expenses:\nProgramming and production 38,450 33,121 34,440 16.1 (3.8)\nOther operating and administrative 35,619 33,109 32,807 7.6 0.9\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion 7,695 6,741 7,617 14.2 (11.5)\nDepreciation 8,628 8,320 8,663 3.7 (4.0)\nAmortization 5,176 4,780 4,290 8.3 11.4\nTotal costs and expenses 95,568 86,071 87,817 11.0 (2.0)\nOperating income 20,817 17,493 21,125 19.0 (17.2)\nInterest expense (4,281) (4,588) (4,567) (6.7) 0.5\nInvestment and other income (loss), net 2,557 1,160 438 120.4 164.8\nIncome before income taxes 19,093 14,065 16,996 35.7 (17.2)\nIncome tax expense (5,259) (3,364) (3,673) 56.3 (8.4)\nNet income 13,833 10,701 13,323 29.3 (19.7)\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock (325) 167 266 NM (37.5)\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 14,159 $ 10,534 $ 13,057 34.4 % (19.3) %\nBasic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$ 3.09 $ 2.30 $ 2.87 34.3 % (19.9) %\nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$ 3.04 $ 2.28 $ 2.83 33.3 % (19.4) %\nAdjusted EBITDA(a)\n$ 34,708 $ 30,826 $ 34,258 12.6 % (10.0) %\nPercentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.\n(a)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

NBCUniversal depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the opening of\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 38\nUniversal Beijing Resort in September 2021. Cable Communications depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions.\nAmortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $2.4 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011.\nConsolidated Interest Expense\nInterest expense decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to $360 million of charges recorded in 2020 related to the early redemption of senior notes compared to $204 million of charges related to early redemptions in 2021, as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding and lower weighted-average interest rates.\nConsolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nEquity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 2,006 $ (113) $ (505)\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 339 1,014 656\nOther income (loss), net 211 259 287\nTotal investment and other income (loss), net $ 2,557 $ 1,160 $ 438\nThe change in investment and other income (loss), net in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to equity in net income (losses) of investees, net related to our investment in Atairos and realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $1.8 billion, $286 million and $(64) million 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2021 primarily included gains related to nonmarketable equity securities and losses on certain marketable securities, compared to the prior year period which primarily included gains on nonmarketable securities.\nConsolidated Income Tax (Expense) Benefit\nOur effective income tax rate in 2021 and 2020 was 27.5% and 23.9%, respectively.\nIn 2021, the effective income tax rate included $498 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes enacted in the United Kingdom in the second quarter of 2021, which, among other provisions, will increase the corporate tax rate to 25% from 19% effective April 1, 2023. The rate change resulted in an increase in our net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase in income tax expense. Our income tax expense will reflect the new rate in the United Kingdom in 2023.\nIn 2020, the effective income tax rate included $145 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes in the third quarter of 2020.\nConsolidated Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock\nThe changes in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to losses at Universal Beijing Resort, which increased due to pre-opening costs prior to its opening in September 2021 (see Note 7).\nSegment Operating Results\nOur segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information.

Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (\u201cMDUs\u201d), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our HD video or DVR services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. Business customers are generally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system, with certain offerings such as Ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships. Wireless lines represent the number of activated, eligible wireless devices on customers\u2019 accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics for 2021 and 2020 do not include customers in certain temporary COVID-19 programs, including an Internet Essentials promotion for new qualifying customers to receive 60 days of free broadband services. This 60-day free Internet Essentials promotional offer ended at the end of December 2021. Customers under this program are excluded from our customer metrics until they begin paying for their service. Total residential customer relationships and broadband customers were updated in the first quarter of 2021 due to a conforming change to methodology, resulting in a reduction of approximately 26,000 customers. There was no impact to net additions and information for all periods presented have been recast on a comparable basis.\n2021 2020 2019 % Change 2021 to 2020 % Change 2020 to 2019\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 159.22 $ 154.84 $ 156.37 2.8 % (1.0) %\nAverage monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 69.55 $ 65.16 $ 62.64 6.7 % 4.0 %\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential broadband, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCable Communications Segment - Revenue\nWe are a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and other services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Our residential and business customers are marketed individually and as bundled services at a discounted rate.\nResidential\nRevenue from our residential customers includes amounts earned for providing our broadband, video, voice and wireless services, including equipment and installation services. Broadband revenue also includes revenue earned related to our customers\u2019 use of Flex and streaming services, and wireless revenue also includes the sale of devices. Revenue from each of our residential services is impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle. Franchise and regulatory fees billed to our customers are included with the relevant service, which primarily relate to video and voice services.\nBroadband\nRevenue increased in 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of residential broadband customers. The remaining increase in revenue was due to an increase in average rates. Average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by waived fees due to COVID-19 and the impacts of customer adjustments. Refer to \u201cVideo\u201d below for additional information.\nWe believe our customer base will continue to grow as consumers choose our broadband service and seek higher-speed offerings.\nVideo\nRevenue was flat in 2021 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential video customers, offset by an increase in average rates. Average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events. For customers receiving bundled services, the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle.\nWe expect that the number of residential video customers will continue to decline, negatively impacting video revenue as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns.\nVoice\nRevenue decreased in 2021 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential voice customers, partially offset by increases in average rates.\nWe expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline.\nWireless\nRevenue increased in 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines and device sales.\nBusiness Services\nRevenue from our business customers includes our service offerings for small business locations, which primarily include broadband, voice and video services, as well as our solutions for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators.\nRevenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in average rates and an increase in the number of customers receiving our services, which included the negative impacts of COVID-19 on small businesses in the prior year period.\nAdvertising\nRevenue consists of the sale of advertising on linear television and digital platforms to local, regional and national advertisers, including where we represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers and revenue from our advanced advertising business.\nRevenue increased in 2021 reflecting an overall market recovery in the current year period and increases in revenue from our advanced advertising business, partially offset by decreases in political advertising compared to the prior year period.\nOther\nRevenue primarily relates to our security and automation services and also includes revenue related to residential customer late fees and related to other services, such as the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\nRevenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in revenue from licensing of our technology platforms and from our security and automation services.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 42\nCable Communications Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming Expenses\nProgramming expenses, which represent our most significant operating expense, are the fees we incur to provide content to our customers. These expenses represent the programming license fees charged by content providers, including the fees related to the distribution of cable and broadcast network programming and fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations.\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming rates, and the impacts in 2020 of adjustment provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events as a result of COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers.\nWe expect that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases, although to a lesser extent in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the timing of contract renewals, which will be offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers.\nTechnical and Product Support Expenses\nExpenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities; costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning; the cost of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches sold to customers; and monthly wholesale wireless access fees.\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service from increases in the sale of devices and the number of customers receiving service, partially offset by lower personnel costs.\nCustomer Service Expenses\nExpenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity.\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses include the costs associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings.\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increased spending associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings, including advertising expenses associated with the Tokyo Olympics, as well as decreased spending as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\nFranchise and Other Regulatory Fees\nExpenses represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities, including fees under the terms of our cable franchise agreements.\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in regulatory costs.\nOther Expenses\nExpenses primarily include administrative personnel costs; fees paid to third-party channels for which Cable represents the advertising sales efforts; other business support costs, including building and office expenses, taxes and billing costs; and bad debt.\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense.\nCable Communications Segment - Operating Margin\nOur operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin was 43.7%, 42.1% and 40.1% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While the accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in an increase to operating margins in 2020.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nNBCUniversal Segments Overview\n2021 NBCUniversal Segments Operating Results(a)\nRevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(in billions) (in billions)\n(a)Segment details in the charts exclude the results of NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other and Eliminations and therefore the amounts do not equal the total.

Excluding $522 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics, distribution revenue increased due to contractual rates increases, increased distribution revenue at Peacock, and credits accrued in 2020 at some of our regional sports networks from fewer games played due to COVID-19 as certain of our distribution agreements with multichannel video providers require contractual adjustments if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur. This increase was partially offset by declines in the number of subscribers at our networks.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to declines in the number of subscribers at our networks and credits accrued at some of our regional sports networks resulting from the reduced number of games played by professional sports leagues due to COVID-19, partially offset by contractual rate increases.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOther\nRevenue primarily relates to the licensing of our owned programming and revenue generated by various digital properties.\nRevenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increased revenue from our digital properties and increased content licensing.\nRevenue increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to timing of content provided under our licensing agreements, offset by decreased revenue from our digital properties.\n* * *\nWe expect the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns.

Revenue in 2021 also was negatively impacted by delays in theatrical releases due to COVID-19 for our film studios.\nRevenue increased in 2020 primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements, including initial licenses of content associated with the launch of Peacock, and increased sales of titles made available on demand, including certain 2020 releases after theater closures due to COVID-19, partially offset by decreases in revenue from our television studios due to delays in production.\nTheatrical\nRevenue relates to the worldwide distribution of our films for exhibition in movie theaters.\nRevenue increased in 2021 primarily due to current year releases, including, and the impact of theater closures as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 primarily due to theater closures as a result of COVID-19.\nHome Entertainment and Other\nRevenue consists of the sale of content on DVDs and through digital distribution services, as well as the production and licensing of live stage plays and the distribution of filmed entertainment produced by third parties. The overall DVD market continues to experience declines due to the maturation of the DVD format from increasing shifts in consumer behavior toward digital distribution services and subscription rental services, both of which generate less revenue per transaction than DVD sales, as well as due to piracy.\nRevenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increased sales of television titles in the current year period.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 primarily due to COVID-19, including from our live stage plays, which were impacted by theater and entertainment venue closures, and a reduced number of releases in 2020.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nStudios Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nExpenses include the amortization of capitalized film and television production and acquisition costs, residuals and participations payments, and distribution expenses.

Customer relationships represent the number of residential customers that subscribe to at least one of Sky\u2019s four primary services of video, broadband, voice and wireless phone service. Sky reports business customers, including hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants, generally based on the number of locations receiving our services. In the first quarter of 2021, we implemented conforming changes to our methodology for counting commercial customers in Italy and Germany, which are counted as described above, consistent with the methodology for customers in the United Kingdom. Previously, customers were counted based on a residential equivalent unit in Italy or the number of active venues or rooms in Germany. This change resulted in a reduction in Sky\u2019s total customer relationships of 714,000 as of December 31, 2020. The impact of the change in methodology to customer relationship net additions for any period was not material. For comparative purposes, we have updated Sky\u2019s historical total customer relationships and average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship to reflect this adjustment.\n2021 2020 2019 % Change 2020 to 2021 % Change 2019 to 2020\nActual Actual Actual Actual Constant\nCurrency\nGrowth(a)\nActual Constant\nCurrency\nGrowth(a)\nAverage monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship $ 59.29 $ 54.56 $ 56.09 8.7 % 2.6 % (2.7) % (3.7) %\n(a)Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Each of Sky\u2019s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to-consumer service offerings.\nSky Segment - Revenue\nDirect-to-Consumer\nRevenue primarily relates to video services provided to both residential and business customers, as well as broadband, voice and wireless services. Video service revenue includes both DTH video services and our NOW streaming service. Revenue from our wireless customers also includes the sale of devices.\nRevenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to an increase in average revenue per customer relationship. This increase reflected the impacts of the postponement of sporting events in the prior year period as a result of COVID-19, an increase in the sale of wireless handsets and rate increases in the United Kingdom, which were partially offset by declines in average rates in Italy. Customer relationships remained relatively consistent with the prior year period as decreases in Italy were offset by increases in the United Kingdom and Germany. The declines in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in Italy primarily resulted from reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, which we had held through the end of the 2020-21 season. Beginning with the 2021-22 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 2023-24 season, we have nonexclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches, which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue and customer relationships in Italy.\nContent\nRevenue relates to the distribution of our owned television channels on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and licensed content.\nRevenue decreased in 2021 compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to lower sports programming licensing revenue driven by changes in licensing agreements in Italy and Germany, partially offset by higher revenue from the distribution of Sky\u2019s sports programming on third-party platforms due to the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 50\nAdvertising\nRevenue consists of the sale of advertising on linear television and digital platforms, including where we represent the sales efforts of third-party channels, as well revenue from various technology, tools and solutions relating to our advertising business.\nRevenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily reflecting an overall market recovery compared to the prior year period.\nSky Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nExpenses primarily relate to content broadcast on our channels. These costs include the amortization of owned and licensed programming, including sports rights, direct production costs, production overhead and on-air talent costs. These expenses also include the fees associated with programming distribution agreements for channels owned by third parties.\nExpenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs associated with Serie A and entertainment programming in the current year period, partially offset by an increase in the number of sporting events in the current year period due to COVID-19, which delayed the starts of the 2020-21 European football seasons.\nDirect Network Costs\nExpenses primarily include costs directly related to the supply of broadband and voice services, including wireless services for wireless handsets and tablets, to our customers. This includes call costs, monthly wholesale access fees and other variable costs associated with our network. In addition, it includes the cost of wireless handsets sold to customers.\nExpenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to an increase in costs associated with Sky\u2019s wireless phone and broadband services as a result of increases in the sale of wireless handsets and the number of customers receiving these services.\nOther Expenses\nExpenses include costs related to marketing, fees paid to third-party channels for which Sky represents the advertising sales efforts, subscriber management, supply chain, transmission, technology, fixed networks and general administrative costs.\nExpenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to higher fees paid to third-party channels related to advertising sales, partially offset by lower personnel costs.\nCorporate, Other and Eliminations\nCorporate and Other Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 % Change\n2020 to 2021 % Change\n2019 to 2020\nRevenue $ 461 $ 248 $ 333 86.1 % (25.6) %\nOperating costs and expenses 1,819 2,033 1,153 (10.5) 76.3\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (1,358) $ (1,785) $ (820) 23.9 % (117.8) %\nCorporate and other primarily includes overhead and personnel costs, the results of other business initiatives and Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Other business initiatives include costs associated with the launch of Sky Glass and the related hardware sales, as well as costs associated with the launch of XClass TV.\nRevenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases at Comcast Spectacor as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year period and sales of Sky Glass televisions.\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year periods in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses, partially offset by costs related to Sky Glass and XClass TV. In 2020, our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives, with the most significant relating to severance at NBCUniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base. The costs of these initiatives were presented in Corporate and Other. Payments related to NBCUniversal employee severance were substantially complete in 2021 and the substantial majority of the related costs savings were being realized in operating costs and expenses as of the end of 2021. A portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives. We expect to incur increased costs in 2022 related to the launch of Sky Glass and XClass TV.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nEliminations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 % Change\n2020 to 2021 % Change\n2019 to 2020\nRevenue $ (3,008) $ (2,540) $ (2,650) 18.5 % (4.2) %\nOperating costs and expenses (2,942) (2,572) (2,652) 14.4 (3.1)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (65) $ 32 $ 2 NM NM\nPercentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.\nAmounts represent eliminations of transactions between Cable Communications, NBCUniversal, Sky and other businesses. Eliminations of transactions between NBCUniversal are presented separately. Current year amounts reflect an increase in eliminations associated with the Tokyo Olympics. Refer to Note 2 for a description of transactions between our segments.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance.\nWe reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation\n$ 14,159 $ 10,534 $ 13,057\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock (325) 167 266\nIncome tax expense 5,259 3,364 3,673\nInvestment and other (income) loss, net (2,557) (1,160) (438)\nInterest expense 4,281 4,588 4,567\nDepreciation 8,628 8,320 8,663\nAmortization 5,176 4,780 4,290\nAdjustments(a)\n87 233 180\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 34,708 $ 30,826 $ 34,258\n(a)Amounts represent the impacts of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, including Sky transaction-related costs and costs related to our investment portfolio. Year to date 2020 also includes $177 million related to a legal settlement.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 52\nConstant Currency\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance.\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year.\nReconciliation of Sky Constant Currency Growth Rates\n2021 2020 % Change 2020 to 2021 2020 2019 % Change 2019 to 2020\nYear ended December 31 (in millions, except per customer data) Actual Constant\nCurrency Constant Currency Change Actual Constant\nCurrency Constant Currency Change\nRevenue\nDirect-to-consumer $ 16,455 $ 16,125 2.0 % $ 15,223 $ 15,698 (3.0) %\nContent 1,341 1,448 (7.4) 1,373 1,443 (4.9)\nAdvertising 2,489 2,101 18.4 1,998 2,270 (12.0)\nTotal revenue 20,285 19,675 3.1 18,594 19,411 (4.2)\nOperating costs and expenses\nProgramming and production 8,949 9,064 (1.3) 8,649 8,967 (3.5)\nDirect network costs 2,612 2,230 17.1 2,086 1,759 18.6\nOther 6,364 6,239 2.0 5,905 5,556 6.3\nTotal operating costs and expenses 17,925 17,533 2.2 16,640 16,282 2.2\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 2,359 $ 2,142 10.2 % $ 1,954 $ 3,129 (37.6) %\nAverage monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship $ 59.29 $ 57.79 2.6 % $ 54.56 $ 56.67 (3.7) %\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nCash provided by operating activities $ 29,146 $ 24,737 $ 25,697\nCash used in investing activities (13,446) (12,047) (14,841)\nCash used in financing activities (18,618) (6,513) (9,181)\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2021 2020\nCash and cash equivalents $ 8,711 $ 11,740\nShort-term and long-term debt $ 94,850 103,760\nOur businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. Refer to \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. We entered into a new revolving credit facility in March 2021 (see Note 6).\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe are subject to customary covenants and restrictions set forth in agreements related to debt issued at Comcast and certain of our subsidiaries, including the indentures governing our public debt securities and the credit agreement governing the Comcast revolving credit facility. Our credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility. Compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis under the terms of the credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin and we expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant and other covenants related to our debt. The covenants and restrictions in our revolving credit facility do not apply to certain entities, including Sky and our international theme parks.\nOperating Activities\nComponents of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nOperating income $ 20,817 $ 17,493 $ 21,125\nDepreciation and amortization 13,804 13,100 12,953\nNoncash share-based compensation 1,315 1,193 1,021\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities (1,499) (178) (2,335)\nPayments of interest (3,908) (3,878) (4,254)\nPayments of income taxes (2,628) (3,183) (3,231)\nProceeds from investments and other 1,246 190 418\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 29,146 $ 24,737 $ 25,697\nThe decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including increased production spending, offset by an increased number of sporting events in 2021, as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, which included the impacts of our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics. These decreases were partially offset by increases related to the operations of our theme parks.\nThe decrease in income tax payments in 2021 was primarily due to the tax deductions resulting from our senior notes exchange (refer to \u201cFinancing Activities\u201d below for additional information), which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion in the current year period and more than offset the higher taxable income from operations in 2021.\nThe increase in proceeds from investments and other in 2021 was primarily due to increased cash distributions received from equity method investments (see Note 8).\nInvesting Activities\nOur most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures, which are discussed further below. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our investment in AirTouch in 2020, the acquisition of Masergy in 2021 and increased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development, partially offset by decreases in purchases of investments, decreases in costs related to the construction of Universal Beijing Resort and the purchase of spectrum in the prior year period.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were flat in 2021 primarily due to reduced spending in our Theme Parks segment as a result of COVID-19, offset by increases in spending in our Cable Communications segment. The costs associated with the construction of Universal Beijing Resort are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 7.\nOur most significant capital expenditures are in our Cable Communications segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. Cable Communications\u2019 capital expenditures increased primarily due to increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions, partially offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment and support capital. The table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our Cable Communications segment in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nCustomer premise equipment $ 2,203 $ 2,333 $ 2,659\nScalable infrastructure 2,658 2,289 2,000\nLine extensions 1,565 1,394 1,392\nSupport capital 503 589 858\nTotal $ 6,930 $ 6,605 $ 6,909\nWe expect our capital expenditures for 2022 will be focused on the increased investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential in our Cable\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 54\nCommunications segment; and the continued deployment of wireless gateways, X1 and Sky Q. In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks in the future, including the development of our additional theme park in Orlando, Florida, which resumed in 2021. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities, repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. Net cash used in financing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented in other financing activities, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the settlement of cross-currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities.\nIn August 2021, we completed a debt exchange transaction. We issued $15.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, which have maturities ranging from 2051 to 2063 and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.93%, and made cash payments of $0.5 billion in exchange for $11.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain series of outstanding senior notes with maturities ranging from 2033 to 2058 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.04%. The debt exchange resulted in an overall reduction in the weighted-average interest rate for our total outstanding debt of 0.27% and extended the overall weighted-average maturity by 2 years. The debt exchange transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, and therefore following the exchange, the book value of the new senior notes is equal to the book value of the exchanged senior notes reduced by the amount of the cash payments, and the difference between the principal and carrying amounts of the new senior notes will accrue through interest expense over the period to maturity of the new senior notes.\nIn 2021, we made debt repayments of $11.5 billion, including $4.9 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2022 to 2023 and the early redemption of $3.3 billion of senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025, as well as amounts due at maturity and the cash payments in the debt exchange transaction.\nIn 2021, we issued \u20ac1.75 billion ($2.1 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate Euro senior notes maturing in 2026 and 2029. In 2021, we had borrowings of $0.6 billion under the Universal Beijing Resort term loan.\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. Effective May 25, 2021, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion. During 2021, we repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion. In January 2022, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization from the $6 billion remaining as of December 31, 2021 to $10 billion. Under the authorization, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares, which may be in the open market or in private transactions.\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.6 billion in 2021. We paid dividends of $4.5 billion in 2021. In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nThe chart below summarizes our share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program authorization and dividends paid in 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, we paid $674 million and $534 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nShare Repurchases Under Share Repurchase Program Authorization and Dividends Paid\n(in billions)\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our most significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:\nAs of December 31, 2021 (in billions) Total Within the next 12 months Beyond the next 12 months\nDebt obligations(a)\n$ 100.8 $ 2.1 $ 98.7\nProgramming and production obligations 75.7 15.4 60.4\n(a) Amounts represent the face value of debt and exclude interest payments and a collateralized obligation (see Note 8).\nOur largest contractual obligations relate to our outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2021, our debt has a weighted-average time to maturity of approximately 18 years and a weighted-average interest rate based on the stated coupons and including the effects of our derivative financial instruments of 3.44%. We typically fund and expect to continue to be able to fund debt maturities and interest payments with cash flows generated in our operations; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; or proceeds from additional external financing. See Note 6 for additional information on our debt.\nWe also have significant contractual obligations associated with our programming and production expenses. NBCUniversal and Sky have multiyear agreements for broadcast rights of sporting events, such as the Olympics, the NFL and European football leagues, which represent the substantial majority of our programming and production obligations. Cable Communications\u2019 programming expenses related to the distribution of third-party programmed channels are generally acquired under multiyear distribution agreements, with fees typically based on the number of customers that receive the programming and the extent of distribution. As a result, the amounts included in the table above under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments for these distribution agreements are not material and we expect the total fees to be paid under these arrangements to be significantly higher than the amounts included above. We have funded and expect to continue to be able to fund our programming and production obligations with the cash generated from our operations. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 40% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, primarily related to multiyear sports rights agreements. See Note 4 for additional information on programming and production costs.\nOur other contractual obligations relate primarily to operating leases (see Note 15) and other arrangements recorded in our balance sheet and/or disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, including benefit plan obligations (see Note 11), liabilities for uncertain tax positions (see Note 5), our remaining unfunded capital commitment to Atairos (see Note 8) and a contractual obligation related to an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks (see Note 15).\nGuarantee Structure\nOur debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 56\nDebt and Guarantee Structure\nDecember 31 (in billions) 2021 2020\nDebt Subject to Cross-Guarantees\nComcast $ 85.9 $ 85.7\nComcast Cable(a)\n2.1 2.1\nNBCUniversal(a)\n1.6 2.8\n89.6 90.6\nDebt Subject to One-Way Guarantees\nSky 6.3 8.4\nOther(a)\n0.1 2.8\n6.5 11.2\nDebt Not Guaranteed\nUniversal Beijing Resort(b)\n3.6 2.5\nOther 1.2 1.1\n4.7 3.6\nDebt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net\n(6.0) (1.6)\nTotal debt $ 94.8 $ 103.8\n(a)NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations.\n(b)Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 7 for additional information.\nCross-Guarantees\nComcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the \u201cGuarantors\u201d) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other\u2019s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor\u2019s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor\u2019s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast\u2019s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable\u2019s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets.\nThe Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $126 billion and $124 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $30 billion and $26 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\nOne-Way Guarantees\nComcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast\u2019s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast\u2019s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis; and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast\u2019s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $96 billion and $94 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $29 billion and $23 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. See also Notes 4 and 10.\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Goodwill and Cable Franchise Rights\nWe assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually as of July 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. When analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.\nWe performed qualitative assessments in 2021 for goodwill in our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments. The qualitative assessments considered that the estimated fair values of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values at the time of our previous quantitative assessments in 2018; changes in projected future cash flows; recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of COVID-19; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. Based on these assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 58\nrequired. We performed a quantitative assessment in 2021 for goodwill in our Sky segment and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was higher than the carrying value. Assets and liabilities resulting from a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced as the value of the businesses in a reporting unit increases and as the carrying value of the reporting unit decreases due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired long-lived assets over time. Given that the goodwill in our Sky segment resulted from our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the Sky reporting unit.\nChanges in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.\nCable Franchise Rights\nOur cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. The amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. Typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. Often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. We currently serve approximately 6,500 franchise areas in the United States.\nWe have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights.\nFor purposes of impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three Cable Communications divisions or units of account. We evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.\nIn 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. At the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2018, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights substantially exceeded their carrying values. We also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment, including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our Cable Communications segment; recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of COVID-19; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.\nChanges in market conditions, laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.\nFilm and Television Content\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. We have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue.\nOur estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film\u2019s initial release. These estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film\u2019s theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. Upon a film\u2019s release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.\nWith respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window. Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. Once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms, such as U.S. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. Revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast. We recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.\nCapitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When performing an impairment assessment, we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts. Adjustments to capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe maintain a mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. In order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt, we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policy.\nWe monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analyses. We do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions.\nOur interest rate derivative financial instruments, which primarily include cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program.\nThe effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments to our consolidated interest expense was a decrease of $2 million in 2021, a decrease of $9 million in 2020, and a decrease of $49 million in 2019. Interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on consolidated interest expense in the future.\nThe table below summarizes by contractual year of maturity the principal amount of our debt, notional amount of our interest rate instruments, effective rates, and fair values subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2021. We estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on December 31, 2021, plus the applicable borrowing margin.\n(in millions) 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total Estimated\nFair Value as of\nDecember 31, 2021\nDebt\nFixed-rate debt $ 2,135 $ 1,056 $ 3,824 $ 6,136 $ 5,232 $ 78,771 $ 97,155 $ 105,613\nAverage interest rate(a)\n6.3 % 2.0 % 3.0 % 3.4 % 2.4 % 3.5 % 3.5 %\nVariable-rate debt $ - $ - $ 500 $ - $ - $ 3,148 $ 3,648 $ 3,654\nAverage interest rate - % - % 1.7 % - % - % 4.4 % 4.0 %\nFixed-to-Variable Swaps\nNotional amount(b)\n$ - $ - $ - $ - $ 1,250 $ 1,250 $ 2,500 $ (24)\nAverage pay rate - % - % - % - % 3.5 % 4.1 % 3.8 %\nAverage receive rate - % - % - % - % 3.3 % 4.0 % 3.7 %\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 60\n(a)Includes the effects of our fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps, which are discussed further below under the heading \u201cForeign Exchange Risk Management.\u201d\n(b)Notional amounts are used to calculate the interest to be paid or received and do not represent our exposure to credit loss. The estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts, excluding accrued interest.\nAdditionally, we have a $5.2 billion variable rate term loan presented separately as a collateralized obligation that will mature in March 2024. We entered into a series of variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps on $5.2 billion of this term loan with an average pay rate of 1.1% and an average receive rate of 0.9% estimated using December 31, 2021 implied forward rates through the year of maturity. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the estimated fair value of the term loan was $5.2 billion for each period, and the estimated fair value of the related interest rate swaps was a net liability of $29 million and a net liability of $155 million, respectively.\nSee Notes 1, 6 and 8 for additional information.\nForeign Exchange Risk Management\nWe have significant operations in a number of countries outside the United States through Sky and NBCUniversal, and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. These changes could adversely affect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of our non-U.S. dollar operations, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories.\nAs part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposure for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as currency exchange rates fluctuate to protect the functional currency equivalent value of non-functional currency denominated assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted non-functional currency revenue and expenses. In accordance with our policy, we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 30 months. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had foreign exchange contracts on transactions other than debt with a total notional value of $8.0 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material.\nWe use cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges for certain foreign currency denominated debt obligations with obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. Cross-currency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency, which hedge currency exchange risks associated with foreign currency denominated cash flows such as interest and principal debt repayments. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges on $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion of our foreign currency denominated debt, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate estimated fair value of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges was a net liability of $53 million and a net liability of $45 million, respectively.\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations. We have foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries. Transaction gains and losses resulting from currency movements on debt and changes in the fair value of cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are recorded within the currency translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using foreign currency denominated debt was $8.2 billion and $10.3 billion, respectively, and the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using cross-currency swaps was $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate estimated fair value of these cross-currency swaps was a net liability of $104 million and $376 million, respectively. The amount of pre-tax gains (losses) related to net investment hedges recognized in the cumulative translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income (loss) were gains of $760 million in 2021, losses of $686 million in 2020 and gains of $343 million in 2019.\nWe have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign operations as of December 31, 2021, including our hedging contracts, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. For those assets and liabilities, we then evaluated the effect of a hypothetical 10% shift in currency exchange rates, inclusive of the effects of derivatives. The results of our analysis indicate that such a shift in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our 2021 net income attributable to Comcast Corporation.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. We have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions. These provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold. The threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparty\u2019s credit ratings. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we were not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements, nor did we hold any collateral under the terms of these agreements.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 62",

The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets.\n\u2022Provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors.\n\u2022Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nAudit Committee Oversight\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has oversight responsibility for our financial reporting process and the audits of the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets regularly with management and with our internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm (collectively, the \u201cauditors\u201d) to review matters related to the quality and integrity of our financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting (including compliance matters related to our Code of Conduct), and the nature, extent, and results of internal and external audits.

We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSky Goodwill - Refer to Note 10 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company\u2019s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of the Sky reporting unit to its carrying value.\nThe Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of expected cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\neither the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The goodwill balance was $70,189 million as of December 31, 2021, of which $29,196 million was allocated to the Sky reporting unit. The fair value of the Sky reporting unit remains in close proximity to its carrying value as of the measurement date.\nWe identified goodwill for Sky as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Sky reporting unit. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows for the Sky reporting unit.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows used by management to estimate the fair value of Sky included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of Sky, such as controls related to management\u2019s selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows.\n\u2022With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n\u2022We evaluated management\u2019s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and cash flows by comparing actual results to (1) historical results, including management\u2019s forecasting accuracy, (2) projections utilized in the prior year goodwill impairment analysis, (3) internal communications to management, and (4) forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer group.\nFilm and Television Costs - Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company amortizes capitalized film and television production costs that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes such costs using the ratio of current period revenue to the total remaining revenue forecasted to be realized, also known as \u201cultimate revenue.\u201d The estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on the rate at which capitalized costs are amortized.\nThe determination of ultimate revenue for capitalized film and television costs requires the Company to make significant estimates of future revenue based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. Given the judgments necessary to estimate ultimate revenue, auditing these estimates involved especially subjective judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to forecasts of ultimate revenue for individual film or television productions included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over its amortization of film and television costs, including controls over forecasts of ultimate revenue.\n\u2022We tested management\u2019s selection of inputs and assumptions, including considering the historical performance of similar titles, expected distribution platforms, factors unique to the individual film or television production, and third-party projections.

The related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheet. Any foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in our consolidated statement of income in investment and other income (loss), net. For disclosures containing future amounts where the functional currency is the local currency, we translate the amounts into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date.\nReclassifications\nReclassifications have been made to our notes to consolidated financial statements for the prior year period to conform to classifications used in 2021. See Note 2 for a discussion of the changes in our presentation of segment operating results.\nAccounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to select accounting policies, including in certain cases industry-specific policies, and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following accounting policies are specific to the industries in which we operate:\n\u2022capitalization and amortization of film and television costs (see Note 4)\n\u2022costs for connecting customers to our cable systems (see Note 9)\nInformation on other accounting policies and methods that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are included, where applicable, in their respective footnotes that follow. The collateralized obligation related to our investment in Hulu is discussed in Note 8 and our other long-term debt is discussed in Note 6. Below is a discussion of accounting policies and methods used in our consolidated financial statements that are not presented within other footnotes.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Our objective is to manage the financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivatives used to economically hedge them.\nOur derivative financial instruments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. We designate certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, including foreign currency denominated cash flows associated with non-functional currency debt and non-functional currency revenue and expenses. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged items affect earnings. For derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nRefer to Note 6 for further information on certain derivative instruments related to debt. The impact of our remaining derivative financial instruments was not material to our consolidated financial statements in any of the periods presented.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe accounting guidance related to fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques. The levels of the hierarchy are described below.\n\u2022Level 1: Values are determined using quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market.\n\u2022Level 2: Values are determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 72\nComcast Corporation\n\u2022Level 3: Values are determined using models that use significant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nWe use the three tier fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of certain financial instruments on a recurring basis, such as for investments (see Note 8); on a non-recurring basis, such as for acquisitions and impairment testing; and for disclosure purposes, such as for long-term debt (see Note 6). Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation and classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nNote 2: Segment Information\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. In 2021, we changed our presentation of segment operating results. We now present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks; and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. The changes reflect a reorganized operating structure in NBCUniversal\u2019s television and streaming businesses and primarily include: (i) the combination of NBCUniversal\u2019s television networks (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the operations of Peacock (previously reported in Corporate and Other) in the Media segment, and (ii) the presentation of NBCUniversal\u2019s television studio production operations (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the studio operations of Filmed Entertainment in the Studios segment. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. See Note 3 for a description of the various products and services within each reportable segment.\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives including our new Sky Glass and XClass TV smart television product launches.\nOur financial data by reportable segment is presented in the tables below. We do not present a measure of total assets for our reportable business segments as this information is not used by management to allocate resources and capital.\n(in millions) Revenue(a)\nAdjusted EBITDA(b)\nDepreciation and Amortization Capital\nExpenditures Cash Paid for\nIntangible\nAssets\nCable Communications $ 64,328 $ 28,097 $ 7,811 $ 6,930 $ 1,438\nNBCUniversal\nMedia 22,780 4,569 1,030 100 163\nStudios 9,449 884 53 5 11\nTheme Parks\n5,051 1,267 906 614 43\nHeadquarters and Other 87 (840) 478 366 143\nEliminations(a)\n(3,048) (205) - - -\nNBCUniversal 34,319 5,675 2,466 1,086 360\nSky 20,285 2,359 3,379 948 814\nCorporate and Other 461 (1,358) 147 210 272\nEliminations(a)\n(3,008) (65) - - -\nComcast Consolidated $ 116,385 $ 34,708 $ 13,804 $ 9,174 $ 2,883\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\n(in millions) Revenue(a)\nAdjusted EBITDA(b)\nDepreciation and\nAmortization Capital\nExpenditures Cash Paid for\nIntangible\nAssets\nCable Communications $ 60,051 $ 25,270 $ 7,753 $ 6,605 $ 1,333\nNBCUniversal\nMedia 18,936 5,574 993 122 176\nStudios 8,134 1,041 67 12 5\nTheme Parks\n2,094 (477) 772 1,171 56\nHeadquarters and Other 53 (563) 475 186 136\nEliminations(a)\n(2,006) (220) - - -\nNBCUniversal 27,211 5,355 2,307 1,491 373\nSky 18,594 1,954 3,034 959 741\nCorporate and Other 248 (1,785) 6 124 8\nEliminations(a)\n(2,540) 32 - - -\nComcast Consolidated $ 103,564 $ 30,826 $ 13,100 $ 9,179 $ 2,455\n(in millions) Revenue(a)\nAdjusted EBITDA(b)\nDepreciation and\nAmortization Capital\nExpenditures Cash Paid for\nIntangible\nAssets\nCable Communications $ 58,082 $ 23,266 $ 7,994 $ 6,909 $ 1,426\nNBCUniversal\nMedia 19,947 5,834 924 204 101\nStudios 9,352 1,058 49 19 10\nTheme Parks\n6,213 2,498 697 1,605 60\nHeadquarters and Other 31 (690) 459 244 166\nEliminations(a)\n(1,585) 11 - - -\nNBCUniversal 33,958 8,711 2,129 2,072 337\nSky 19,219 3,099 2,699 768 707\nCorporate and Other 333 (820) 131 204 5\nEliminations(a)\n(2,650) 2 - - -\nComcast Consolidated $ 108,942 $ 34,258 $ 12,953 $ 9,953 $ 2,475\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 74\nComcast Corporation\n(a)Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nCable Communications $ 244 $ 202 $ 162\nNBCUniversal\nMedia 2,330 1,965 2,202\nStudios 3,186 2,214 1,727\nTheme Parks 2 - -\nHeadquarters and Other 68 31 1\nSky 32 17 21\nCorporate and Other 193 117 121\nTotal intersegment revenue $ 6,055 $ 4,546 $ 4,235\n(b)We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments.

Revenue from customers that purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is allocated between the separate services based on the respective stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the current prices at which we separately sell the services. Significant judgment is used to determine performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and the allocation of revenue when services are combined in a bundle. Customers are typically billed in advance and pay on a monthly basis. Installation fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of benefit to the customer, which is less than a year. While a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are typically 1 to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services on a basis that is consistent with our customers that are not subject to contracts. Our services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as set-top boxes, cable modems and wireless gateways. The timing and pattern of recognition for customer premise equipment revenue are consistent with those of our services. We recognize revenue from the sale of wireless handsets at the point of sale. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year. We also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are generally the sales agent in these arrangements and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within broadband revenue.\nUnder the terms of cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue. We generally pass these and other similar fees through to our customers and classify these fees in the respective Cable Communications services revenue with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.\nBusiness Services\nRevenue is generated from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our service offerings for small business locations primarily include broadband services, as well as voice and video services, that are similar to those provided to residential customers, and include certain other features specific to businesses. We also offer Ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and other services to meet the needs of medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators.\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging from 2 years for small and medium-sized businesses to up to 5 years for larger enterprises. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual business services revenue, of which the substantial majority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers with contracts may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We receive payments based on a billing schedule established in our contracts, which is typically on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\nAdvertising\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to multichannel video providers in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on digital platforms. We enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and the timing of airing is scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from when advertisements are aired or viewed. In addition, we also provide technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences. Revenue earned in this manner is recognized when services are provided.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nNBCUniversal Segments\nAdvertising\nMedia generates revenue from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and digital properties.\nWe enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and the timing of airing is scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days. In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in contracts where the ratings were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\nDistribution\nMedia generates revenue from the distribution of cable network programming in the United States and internationally to multichannel video providers, including both traditional providers of linear programming and virtual providers who provide streaming services for linear programming. Media also generates revenue from the fees received from multichannel video providers under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements and associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. Additionally, Media generates revenue from monthly subscription fees received from certain Peacock subscribers.\nMonthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally under multiyear agreements and based on the number of subscribers. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment within 60 days. These arrangements are accounted for as licenses of functional intellectual property and revenue is recognized as programming is provided on a monthly basis.\nContent Licensing\nStudios generates revenue from the licensing of our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to cable, broadcast and premium networks and to DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-per-view services. Media also generates revenue from licensing of our owned television content, which is reported in other revenue. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film\u2019s theatrical release, Studios may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue at the later of when the content is available or when the renewal or extension period begins. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing third-party agreements at any given time equals approximately one half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this future revenue. The majority of this revenue will be recognized within 2 years. This amount may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\nTheatrical\nStudios generates revenue from the worldwide theatrical release of produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. Our arrangements with exhibitors generally entitle us to a percentage of ticket sales. We recognize revenue as the films are viewed and exhibited in theaters and payment generally occurs within 30 days after exhibition.\nHome Entertainment\nStudios generates revenue from the sale of our produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Media also generates revenue from the sale of owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services, which is reported in other revenue. We generally recognize revenue from DVD sales, net of estimated returns and customer incentives, on the date that DVDs are delivered to and made available for sale by retailers. Payment terms generally include payment within 60 to 90 days from delivery to the retailer.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 78\nComcast Corporation\nTheme Parks\nTheme Parks generates revenue primarily from guest spending at our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; Osaka, Japan; and Beijing, China. Guest spending includes ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise. We also generate revenue from our consumer products business. Additionally, we license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. We recognize revenue from ticket sales when the tickets are used, generally within a year from the date of purchase. For annual passes, we generally recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the period the pass is available to be used. We recognize revenue from in-park spending and consumer products at the point of sale.\nSky Segment\nDirect-to-Consumer\nRevenue is generated from subscribers to our video services from both residential and business customers, primarily in the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. We also provide broadband, voice and wireless phone services in select countries. Generally, all of our residential customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging from rolling monthly to 18 months, depending on the product and territory, and may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. Subscription rates and related charges vary according to the services and features customers receive and the types of equipment they use, and customers are typically billed in advance on a monthly basis. Our video, broadband, voice and wireless services generally may be purchased individually or in bundles. We recognize revenue from video, broadband, voice and wireless services as the services are provided on a monthly basis. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to existing agreements is equal to less than half of our annual direct-to-consumer revenue, which generally will be recognized within 18 months.\nContent\nRevenue is generated from the distribution of our owned channels on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and licensed content to third-party video providers. See the NBCUniversal segment discussion of distribution and content licensing revenue above for accounting policies for these types of arrangements.\nAdvertising\nRevenue is generated from advertising across our owned television channels and where we represent the sales efforts of third-party channels. We also generate revenue from the sale of advertising on digital platforms and various technology, tools and solutions relating to our advertising business. Revenue is recognized when the advertising is aired or viewed. Since we are acting as the principal in the arrangements where we represent the sales efforts of third parties, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to the third-party channels in other operating and administrative expenses.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nThe following table summarizes our accounts receivable:\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2021 2020\nReceivables, gross $ 12,666 $ 12,273\nLess: Allowance for doubtful accounts 658 807\nReceivables, net $ 12,008 $ 11,466\nThe following table presents changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts:\n(in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nBeginning balance $ 807 $ 419 $ 352\nAdditions charged to costs and expenses and other accounts 316 912 769\nDeductions from reserves 465 524 702\nEnding balance $ 658 $ 807 $ 419\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nThe following table summarizes our other balances that are not separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet that relate to the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash, as well as the deferred costs associated with our contracts with customers:\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2021 2020\nNoncurrent receivables, net (included in other noncurrent assets, net) $ 1,632 $ 1,091\nContract acquisition and fulfillment costs (included in other noncurrent assets, net) $ 1,094 $ 1,060\nNoncurrent deferred revenue (included in other noncurrent liabilities) $ 695 $ 750\nNote 4: Programming and Production Costs\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020\nVideo distribution programming $ 13,550 $ 12,684\nFilm and television content:\nOwned(a)\n8,957 7,973\nLicensed, including sports rights 14,733 11,264\nOther 1,210 1,200\nTotal programming and production costs $ 38,450 $ 33,121\n(a) Amount includes amortization of owned content of $7.3 billion and $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as well as participations and residuals expenses.\nVideo Distribution Programming Expenses\nWe incur programming expenses related to the license of the rights to distribute the third-party programmed channels, platforms and related content included in video services we sell to end consumers. Programming is generally acquired under multiyear distribution agreements, with fees typically based on the number of customers that receive the programming and the extent of distribution. Programming distribution arrangements are accounted for as executory contracts with expenses generally recognized based on the rates in the agreements and the arrangements are not subject to impairment.\nFilm and Television Content\nWe incur costs related to the production of owned content and the license of the rights to use content owned by third parties and sports rights on our owned networks and platforms, which are described as owned and licensed content, respectively. We have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis.\nCapitalized Film and Television Costs\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2021 2020\nOwned:\nReleased, less amortization $ 3,726 $ 3,815\nCompleted, not released 536 139\nIn production and in development 2,732 2,755\n6,994 6,709\nLicensed, including sports advances 5,811 6,631\nFilm and television costs $ 12,806 $ 13,340\nThe table below summarizes estimated future amortization expense for the capitalized film and television costs recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.\n(in millions) Owned Licensed\nCompleted, not released:\n2022 $ 345\nReleased and licensed content:\n2022 $ 1,799 $ 3,649\n2023 $ 700 $ 902\n2024 $ 387 $ 563\nWe have future minimum commitments for sports rights and licensed content that are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 totaling $59.5 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 80\nComcast Corporation\nCapitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Content\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\nWe may enter into cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. Cofinancing arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor\u2019s interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor\u2019s interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\nSports Rights\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content.\nNote 5: Income Taxes\nIncome Before Income Taxes\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nDomestic $ 21,243 $ 16,211 $ 16,646\nForeign (2,150) (2,146) 350\n$ 19,093 $ 14,065 $ 16,996\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nComponents of Income Tax Expense\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nCurrent (Expense) Benefit:\nFederal $ (2,355) $ (2,824) $ (2,085)\nState (669) (836) (425)\nForeign (343) (254) (600)\n(3,367) (3,914) (3,110)\nDeferred (Expense) Benefit:\nFederal (1,504) 111 (902)\nState (255) 71 15\nForeign (133) 368 324\n(1,892) 550 (563)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit $ (5,259) $ (3,364) $ (3,673)\nOur income tax expense differs from the federal statutory amount because of the effect of the items detailed in the table below.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nFederal tax at statutory rate $ (4,009) $ (2,954) $ (3,569)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit (464) (265) (306)\nForeign income taxed at different rates (392) (24) (126)\nAdjustments to uncertain and effectively settled tax positions, net (238) (344) (3)\nFederal research and development credits 85 164 124\nExcess tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation 209 150 196\nTax legislation (498) (120) 31\nOther 48 29 (20)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit $ (5,259) $ (3,364) $ (3,673)\nWe base our provision for income taxes on our current period income, changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions, tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate and excess tax benefits or deficiencies that arise when the tax consequences of share-based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in the statement of income. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when there are temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and for the expected benefits of using net operating loss carryforwards. When a change in the tax rate or tax law has an impact on deferred taxes, we apply the change based on the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We record the change in our consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment.\nThe determination of the income tax consequences of a business combination includes identifying the tax basis of assets and liabilities acquired and any contingencies associated with uncertain tax positions assumed or resulting from the business combination. Deferred tax assets and liabilities related to temporary differences of an acquired entity are recorded as of the date of the business combination and are based on our estimate of the ultimate tax basis that will be accepted by the various tax authorities. We record liabilities for contingencies associated with prior tax returns filed by the acquired entity based on criteria set forth in the appropriate accounting guidance. We adjust the deferred tax accounts and the liabilities periodically to reflect any revised estimated tax basis and any estimated settlements with the various tax authorities. The effects of these adjustments are recorded to income tax expense.\nFrom time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. In these cases, we evaluate our tax position using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions, including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions, certain financing transactions, and the allocation of income among state and local tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We classify interest and penalties, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax (expense) benefit.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 82\nComcast Corporation\nComponents of Net Deferred Tax Liability\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2021 2020\nDeferred Tax Assets:\nNet operating loss and other loss carryforwards $ 3,194 $ 2,609\nNondeductible accruals and other 3,246 3,253\nLess: Valuation allowance 2,907 2,312\n3,533 3,550\nDeferred Tax Liabilities:\nDifferences between book and tax basis of property and equipment and intangible assets 30,584 29,829\nDifferences between book and tax basis of investments 526 405\nDifferences between book and tax basis of long-term debt 1,788 680\nDifferences between book and tax basis of foreign subsidiaries and undistributed foreign earnings\n394 468\n33,292 31,382\nNet deferred tax liability $ 29,759 $ 27,832\nThe following table presents changes in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets:\n(in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nBeginning balance $ 2,312 $ 1,906 $ 632\nAdditions charged to income tax expense and other accounts 635 430 1,403\nDeductions from reserves 40 24 129\nEnding balance $ 2,907 $ 2,312 $ 1,906\nChanges in our net deferred tax liability in 2021 that were not recorded as deferred income tax benefit (expense) are primarily related to an increase of $73 million related to acquisitions and a decrease of $44 million associated with items included in other comprehensive income (loss).\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $196 million, and various state net operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which expire in periods through 2041. As of December 31, 2021, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $9.6 billion related to our foreign operations, primarily at Sky and NBCUniversal, the majority of which can be carried forward indefinitely. The determination of the realization of the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on our subsidiaries\u2019 taxable income or loss, apportionment percentages, redetermination from taxing authorities, and state and foreign laws that can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforwards. We recognize a valuation allowance if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our valuation allowance was primarily related to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nReconciliation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\n(in millions)\n2021 2020 2019\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, January 1 $ 1,879 $ 1,422 $ 1,543\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 352 436 230\nAdditions based on tax positions related to prior years 111 152 133\nReductions for tax positions of prior years (181) (31) (344)\nReductions due to expiration of statutes of limitations (107) (76) (117)\nSettlements with tax authorities and other (12) (24) (23)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, December 31 $ 2,042 $ 1,879 $ 1,422\nOur gross unrecognized tax benefits include both amounts related to positions for which we have recorded liabilities for potential payment obligations and those for which tax has been assessed and paid. The amounts exclude the federal benefits on state tax positions that were recorded to deferred income taxes. If we were to recognize our gross unrecognized tax benefits in the future, $1.5 billion would impact our effective tax rate and the remaining amount would increase our deferred income tax liability. The amount and timing of the recognition of any such tax benefit is dependent on the completion of examinations of our tax filings by the various tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations. It is reasonably possible that certain tax contests could be resolved within the next 12 months that may result in a decrease in our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, accrued interest and penalties associated with our liability for uncertain tax positions were not material.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nThe IRS has completed its examination of our income tax returns for all years through 2016. Various states are examining our state tax returns and the tax years of those tax returns currently under examination vary by state, with most of the periods relating to tax years 2011 and forward. Various foreign jurisdictions are examining our tax returns and the tax years of those tax returns currently under examination vary by country, with most of the periods relating to tax years 2010 and forward.\nNote 6: Long-Term Debt\nLong-Term Debt Outstanding\nDecember 31 (in millions) Weighted-Average\nInterest Rate as of\nDecember 31, 2021 Weighted-Average Interest Rate as of December 31, 2020 2021(b)\n2020(b)\nTerm loans 4.41 % 2.07 % $ 3,148 $ 7,641\nSenior notes with maturities of 5 years or less, at face value 3.50 % 3.41 % 18,443 19,190\nSenior notes with maturities between 5 and 10 years, at face value 3.16 % 3.47 % 22,964 23,114\nSenior notes with maturities greater than 10 years, at face value 3.67 % 4.03 % 54,536 54,203\nFinance lease obligations and other 1,713 1,261\nDebt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (5,954) (1,649)\nTotal debt 3.74 % (a)\n3.67 % (a)\n94,850 103,760\nLess: Current portion 2,132 3,146\nLong-term debt $ 92,718 $ 100,614\n(a)Rate represents an effective interest rate and includes the effects of amortization of debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, as well as the effects of our derivative financial instruments.\n(b)As of December 31, 2021, included in our outstanding debt were foreign currency denominated senior notes and term loans with principal amounts of \u00a32.6 billion, \u20ac7.5 billion and \u00a520.0 billion RMB. As of December 31, 2020, included in our outstanding debt were foreign currency denominated senior notes and term loans with principal amounts of \u00a34.7 billion, \u20ac7.3 billion, \u00a5238.5 billion and \u00a516.4 billion RMB.\nOur senior notes are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations and are subject to parent and/or subsidiary guarantees. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our debt had an estimated fair value of $109.3 billion and $125.6 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nPrincipal Maturities of Debt\n(in millions)\n2022 $ 2,135\n2023 $ 1,056\n2024 $ 4,324\n2025 $ 6,136\n2026 $ 5,232\nThereafter $ 81,919\nWe use cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges for certain foreign currency denominated debt obligations with obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. Cross-currency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency, which hedge currency exchange risks associated with foreign currency denominated cash flows such as interest and principal debt repayments. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges on $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion of our foreign currency denominated debt, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate estimated fair value of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges was a net liability of $53 million and a net liability of $45 million, respectively.\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations. We have foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries. Transaction gains and losses resulting from currency movements on debt and changes in the fair value of cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are recorded within the currency translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 84\nComcast Corporation\nhedged using foreign currency denominated debt was $8.2 billion and $10.3 billion, respectively, and the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using cross-currency swaps was $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate estimated fair value of these cross-currency swaps was a net liability of $104 million and $376 million, respectively. The amount of pre-tax gains (losses) related to net investment hedges recognized in the cumulative translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income (loss) were gains of $760 million in 2021, losses of $686 million in 2020 and gains of $343 million in 2019.\nRevolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs\nIn March 2021, we entered into a new $11 billion revolving credit facility due March 30, 2026 with a syndicate of banks that may be used for general corporate purposes. We may increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility up to a total of $14 billion, as well as extend the expiration date to no later than March 30, 2028, subject to approval of the lenders. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility consists of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcast\u2019s credit rating. As of December 31, 2021, the borrowing margin for borrowings based on the London Interbank Offered Rate was 1.00%. Our revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios based on debt and EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with all financial covenants for all periods presented. The new revolving credit facility replaced an aggregate $9.2 billion of existing revolving credit facilities due May 26, 2022, which were terminated.\nOur commercial paper program is supported by our revolving credit facility and provides a lower cost source of borrowing to fund short-term working capital requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs or revolving credit facilities. As of December 31, 2021, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11 billion.\nLetters of Credit and Bank Guarantees\nAs of December 31, 2021, we and certain of our subsidiaries had undrawn irrevocable standby letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling $341 million to cover potential fundings under various agreements.\nNote 7: Significant Transactions\nUniversal Beijing Resort\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (\u201cUniversal Beijing Resort\u201d), which opened in September 2021. We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a529.7 billion RMB (approximately $4.7 billion), which was increased from \u00a526.6 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion) in the third quarter of 2021. The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2021, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.6 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort\u2019s results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the \u201cconstruction of Universal Beijing Resort\u201d and \u201cproceeds from borrowings\u201d captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $9.7 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nAcquisitions\nIn October 2021, we acquired Masergy, a provider of software-defined networking and cloud platforms for global enterprises, for total cash consideration of $1.2 billion. The acquisition accelerates our growth in serving large and mid-sized companies, particularly U.S.-based organizations with multi-site global enterprises. Masergy\u2019s results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date and are reported in our Cable Communications segment. We have recorded a preliminary estimate of Masergy\u2019s assets and liabilities with approximately $850 million recorded to goodwill and the remainder primarily attributed to software and customer relationship intangible assets. These estimates are not yet final and are subject to change. The acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations.\nNote 8: Investments\nInvestment and Other Income (Loss), Net\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n2021 2020 2019\nEquity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 2,006 $ (113) $ (505)\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 339 1,014 656\nOther income (loss), net 211 259 287\nInvestment and other income (loss), net $ 2,557 $ 1,160 $ 438\nThe amount of unrealized gains (losses), net recognized in 2021, 2020 and 2019 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period was $(80) million, $339 million and $237 million, respectively.\nInvestments\nDecember 31 (in millions)\n2021 2020\nEquity method $ 6,111 $ 6,006\nMarketable equity securities 406 460\nNonmarketable equity securities 1,735 1,950\nOther investments 803 143\nTotal investments 9,055 8,559\nLess: Current investments 368 292\nLess: Investment securing collateralized obligation 605 447\nNoncurrent investments $ 8,082 $ 7,820\nEquity Method\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee\u2019s operating and financial policies, or in which we hold a partnership or limited liability company interest in an entity with specific ownership accounts, unless we have virtually no influence over the investee\u2019s operating and financial policies. Equity method investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted to recognize (1) our share, based on percentage ownership or other contractual basis, of the investee\u2019s net income or loss after the date of investment, (2) amortization of the recorded investment that exceeds our share of the book value of the investee\u2019s net assets, (3) additional contributions made and dividends or other distributions received, and (4) impairments resulting from other-than-temporary declines in fair value. For some investments, we record our share of the investee\u2019s net income or loss one quarter in arrears due to the timing of our receipt of such information. Gains or losses on the sale of equity method investments are recorded to other income (loss), net. If an equity method investee were to issue additional securities that would change our proportionate share of the entity, we would recognize the change, if any, as a gain or loss to other income (loss), net. Cash distributions received from equity method investments are considered returns on investment and presented within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows to the extent of cumulative equity in net income of the investee. Additional distributions are presented as investing activities. Distributions presented within operating activities totaled $1.1 billion, $66 million and $215 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAtairos\nOn January 1, 2016, we established Atairos Group, Inc., a strategic company focused on investing in and operating companies in a range of industries and business sectors, both domestically and internationally. Atairos is controlled by management companies led by our former CFO through interests that carry all of the voting rights. We are the only third-party investor in Atairos.\nIn November 2020, we amended our agreement with Atairos, which primarily extended the investment term of the agreement from up to 12 years to up to 16.5 years, extended the period in which capital can be recycled to the full investment period and\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 86\nComcast Corporation\ndecreased our commitment to fund Atairos from up to $5 billion to up to $4.5 billion in the aggregate at any one time, subject to certain offsets, with the maximum amount of annual capital calls reduced to $400 million, plus certain amounts previously distributed. In addition, we have separately committed to fund Atairos $45 million annually for a management fee, subject to certain adjustments. The management company investors have committed to fund from $50 million to $100 million, with at least $40 million to be funded by our former CFO, subject to his continued role with Atairos. Our economic interests do not carry voting rights and obligate us to absorb approximately 99% of any losses and they provide us the right to receive approximately 86% of any residual returns in Atairos, in either case on a cumulative basis.\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairos as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements. This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made cash capital contributions totaling $47 million, $383 million and $571 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $4.7 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.\nHulu and Collateralized Obligation\nIn May 2019, we entered into a series of agreements (the \u201cHulu Transaction\u201d) with The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries, whereby we relinquished our board seats and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. We also acquired our proportionate share of the approximate 10% interest in Hulu previously held by AT&T for approximately $477 million, increasing our ownership interest to approximately 33% from approximately 30%.\nFollowing the Hulu Transaction, future capital calls are limited to $1.5 billion in the aggregate each year, with any excess funding requirements funded with member loans. We have the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of these capital calls, and if we elect not to fund our share of future equity capital calls, our ownership interest will be diluted, subject to an ownership floor of 21%. The Hulu Transaction agreements include put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we can require Disney to buy, and Disney can require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. The minimum total equity value and ownership floor guarantee minimum proceeds of approximately $5.8 billion upon exercise of the put or call.\nIn connection with the Hulu Transaction, we agreed to extend certain licenses of NBCUniversal content until late 2024. We can terminate most of our content license agreements with Hulu beginning in 2022, and we obtained the right, beginning in 2020, to modify certain exclusive content licenses so that we can exhibit the content on our platforms in return for reduced license fees.\nIn August 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024. The principal amount of the term loan is secured by the proceeds guaranteed by Disney under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. The proceeds from the put/call provisions are available only for the repayment of the term loan and are not available to us unless and until the bank lenders are fully paid under the term loan provisions. The bank lenders have no rights to proceeds from the put/call provisions in excess of amounts owed under the term loan. As a result of this transaction, we now present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our consolidated balance sheet in the captions \u201cinvestment securing collateralized obligation\u201d and \u201ccollateralized obligation\u201d, respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. As of December 31, 2021, our collateralized obligation had both a carrying value and estimated fair value of $5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nMarketable Equity Securities\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\nNonmarketable Equity Securities\nWe classify investments without readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as nonmarketable equity securities. The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to a majority of our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\nOther Investments\nAirTouch\nIn April 2020, Verizon Americas, Inc., formerly known as AirTouch Communications, Inc. (\u201cAirTouch\u201d), redeemed the two series of preferred stock we previously held and we received cash payments totaling $1.7 billion. Subsequently, we redeemed and repurchased the related three series of preferred shares issued by one of our consolidated subsidiaries and made cash payments totaling $1.8 billion.\nImpairment Testing of Investments\nWe review our investment portfolio, other than our marketable equity securities, each reporting period to determine whether there are identified events or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments and held to maturity investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments and our held to maturity investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 88\nComcast Corporation\nNote 9: Property and Equipment\nDecember 31 (in millions) Weighted-Average\nOriginal Useful Life\nas of December 31, 2021 2021 2020\nDistribution systems 11 years $ 41,814 $ 40,861\nCustomer premise equipment 6 years 25,772 26,323\nBuildings, theme park infrastructure and leasehold improvements 31 years 20,258 15,885\nOther equipment 11 years 16,960 14,371\nConstruction in process N/A 3,131 7,095\nLand N/A 1,722 1,848\nProperty and equipment, at cost 109,658 106,383\nLess: Accumulated depreciation 55,611 54,388\nProperty and equipment, net $ 54,047 $ 51,995\nThe table below summarizes our property and equipment by geographic location.\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2021 2020\nUnited States $ 41,187 $ 40,580\nOther 12,860 11,415\nProperty and equipment, net $ 54,047 $ 51,995\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. We capitalize improvements that extend asset lives and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred. We record depreciation using the straight-line method over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation and, unless the gain or loss on disposition is presented separately, we recognize it as a component of depreciation expense. Capital expenditures for the construction of Universal Beijing Resort are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nCable Communications capitalizes the costs associated with the construction of and improvements to our cable transmission and distribution facilities, including scalable infrastructure and line extensions; costs associated with acquiring and deploying new customer premise equipment; and costs associated with installation of our services, including the customer\u2019s connection to our network, in accordance with the accounting guidance related to cable television companies. Costs capitalized include all direct costs for labor and materials, as well as various indirect costs. Costs incurred in connection with subsequent disconnects, and reconnects of previously deployed customer premise equipment, are expensed as they are incurred.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of depreciation expense.\nCertain of our cable franchise agreements and lease agreements contain provisions requiring us to restore facilities or remove property in the event that the franchise or lease agreement is not renewed. We expect to continually renew our cable franchise agreements and therefore cannot reasonably estimate liabilities associated with such agreements. A remote possibility exists that franchise agreements could be terminated unexpectedly, which could result in us incurring significant expense in complying with restoration or removal provisions. We do not have any material liabilities related to asset retirement obligations recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nNote 10: Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill by Segment\nNBCUniversal\n(in millions) Cable\nCommunications Cable\nNetworks Broadcast\nTelevision Filmed\nEntertainment Media Studios Theme\nParks Sky Corporate\nand Other Total\nBalance, December 31, 2019 $ 15,074 $ 14,067 $ 1,059 $ 3,321 $ - $ - $ 6,739 $ 28,461 $ 4 $ 68,725\nAcquisitions 122 - - 27 - - - - - 149\nForeign currency translation and other 68 (73) 3 (4) - - 314 1,489 (2) 1,795\nBalance, December 31, 2020 15,264 13,994 1,062 3,344 - - 7,053 29,950 2 70,669\nSegment change - (13,994) (1,062) (3,344) 14,728 3,672 - - - -\nAcquisitions 950 - - - 6 3 - 21 - 979\nForeign currency translation and other (22) - - - (34) (3) (624) (775) (2) (1,459)\nBalance, December 31, 2021 $ 16,192 $ - $ - $ - $ 14,700 $ 3,672 $ 6,429 $ 29,196 $ - $ 70,189\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from anticipated synergies and intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint, assembled workforce, noncontractual relationships and other agreements. We assess the recoverability of our goodwill annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense. We have not recognized any material impairment charges.\nIntangible Assets\n2021 2020\nDecember 31 (in millions) Weighted-Average\nOriginal Useful Life\nas of December 31, 2021 Gross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets:\nFranchise rights N/A $ 59,365 $ 59,365\nFCC licenses N/A 2,807 2,804\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets:\nCustomer relationships 14 years 22,119 $ (10,612) 22,197 $ (8,914)\nSoftware 5 years 20,329 (11,520) 17,819 (9,518)\nOther agreements and rights 28 years 11,870 (1,413) 12,394 (1,393)\nTotal $ 116,491 $ (23,545) $ 114,579 $ (19,825)\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 90\nComcast Corporation\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of our cable franchise rights. Our cable franchise rights represent the values we attributed to agreements with state and local authorities that allow access to homes and businesses in cable service areas acquired in business combinations. We do not amortize our cable franchise rights because we have determined that they meet the definition of indefinite-lived intangible assets since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. We reassess this determination periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The purchase of spectrum rights is presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nWe assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Our three Cable Communications divisions represent the unit of account we use to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information. If the fair value of our cable franchise rights or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense. We did not recognize any material impairment charges in any of the periods presented.\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nEstimated Amortization Expense of Finite-Lived Intangible Assets\n(in millions)\n2022 $ 5,140\n2023 $ 4,513\n2024 $ 3,737\n2025 $ 2,996\n2026 $ 2,403\nFinite-lived intangible assets are subject to amortization and consist primarily of customer relationships acquired in business combinations, software, trade names and intellectual property rights. Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or the term of the associated agreement.\nWe capitalize direct development costs associated with internal-use software, including external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees devoting time to these software projects. We also capitalize costs associated with arrangements that constitute the purchase of, or convey a license to, software licenses. We generally amortize them on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed five years. We expense maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of a project, as they are incurred. We capitalize initial operating system software costs and amortize them over the life of the associated hardware.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nNote 11: Employee Benefit Plans\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nBenefit obligation $ 4,002 $ 3,648 $ 3,273\nInterest expense $ 265 $ 293 $ 285\nWe maintain unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plans for certain members of management and nonemployee directors. The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participant accounts are credited with income primarily based on a fixed annual rate. Participants are eligible to receive distributions from their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.\nWe have purchased life insurance policies to recover a portion of the future payments related to our deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash surrender value of these policies, which is recorded to other noncurrent assets, net, was $549 million and $481 million, respectively.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor several 401(k) defined contribution retirement plans that allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation through payroll deductions in accordance with specified plan guidelines. We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees\u2019 contributions up to certain limits. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, expenses related to these plans totaled $595 million, $599 million and $573 million, respectively.\nWe participate in various multiemployer benefit plans, including pension and postretirement benefit plans, that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We also participate in other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare and retirement savings benefits to active and retired participants. If we cease to be obligated to make contributions or were to otherwise withdraw from participation in any of these plans, applicable law would require us to fund our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits, which is known as a withdrawal liability. In addition, actions taken by other participating employers may lead to adverse changes in the financial condition of one of these plans, which could result in an increase in our withdrawal liability. Total contributions we made to multiemployer benefit plans and any potential withdrawal liabilities were not material in any of the periods presented.\nNote 12: Equity\nCommon Stock\nIn the aggregate, holders of our Class A common stock have 662/3% of the voting power of our common stock and holders of our Class B common stock have 331/3% of the voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Each share of our Class B common stock is entitled to 15 votes. The number of votes held by each share of our Class A common stock depends on the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding at any given time. The 331/3% aggregate voting power of our Class B common stock cannot be diluted by additional issuances of any other class of common stock.

Awards generally vest over a period of 5 years and, in the case of stock options, have a 10 year term. Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. As of December 31, 2021, all of our stock options outstanding were net settled stock options, which result in fewer shares being issued and no cash proceeds being received by us when the options are exercised.\nStock Options and Restricted Share Units\nAs of December 31, 2021, unless otherwise stated (in millions, except per share data) Stock\nOptions RSUs\nAwards granted during 2021 44 17\nWeighted-average exercise price of awards granted during 2021 $ 54.22\nStock options outstanding and nonvested RSUs 211 44\nWeighted-average exercise price of stock options outstanding $ 40.38\nWeighted-average fair value at grant date of nonvested RSUs $ 45.33\nThe cost associated with our share-based compensation is based on an award\u2019s estimated fair value at the date of grant and is recognized over the period in which any related services are provided. RSUs are valued based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and are discounted for the lack of dividends, if any, during the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards.\nThe table below presents the weighted-average fair value on the date of grant of RSUs and stock options awarded under our various plans and the related weighted-average valuation assumptions.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nYear ended December 31 2021 2020 2019\nRSUs fair value $ 54.52 $ 41.71 $ 40.42\nStock options fair value $ 9.72 $ 6.61 $ 7.91\nStock Option Valuation Assumptions:\nDividend yield 1.8 % 2.2 % 2.1 %\nExpected volatility 22.8 % 21.0 % 22.0 %\nRisk-free interest rate 0.9 % 1.0 % 2.5 %\nExpected option life (in years) 5.9 6.0 6.0\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had unrecognized pretax compensation expense of $1.2 billion related to nonvested RSUs and unrecognized pretax compensation expense of $592 million related to nonvested stock options that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 and 1.7 years, respectively. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recognized $209 million, $150 million and $196 million, respectively, as a reduction to income tax expense as a result of excess tax benefits associated with our share-based compensation plans.\nNote 14: Supplemental Financial Information\nCash Payments for Interest and Income Taxes\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nInterest $ 3,908 $ 3,878 $ 4,254\nIncome taxes $ 2,628 $ 3,183 $ 3,231\nNoncash Activities\nDuring 2021:\n\u2022we acquired $2.0 billion of property and equipment and intangible assets that were accrued but unpaid\n\u2022we recorded a liability of $1.1 billion for a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share paid in January 2022\nDuring 2020:\n\u2022we acquired $1.9 billion of property and equipment and intangible assets that were accrued but unpaid\n\u2022we recorded a liability of $1.1 billion for a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per common share paid in January 2021\nDuring 2019:\n\u2022we acquired $1.9 billion of property and equipment and intangible assets that were accrued but unpaid\n\u2022we recorded a liability of $956 million for a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share paid in January 2020\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the consolidated balance sheet to the total of the amounts reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2021 2020\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 8,711 $ 11,740\nRestricted cash included in other current assets\n56 14\nRestricted cash included in other noncurrent assets, net\n12 14\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of year $ 8,778 $ 11,768\nOur cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and U.S. government obligations, as well as commercial paper and certificates of deposit with maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Refer to Note 4 for additional information.\nLeases\nOur leases consist primarily of real estate, vehicles and other equipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally utilize our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The lease asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are not recorded for leases with an initial term of one year or less. Lease expense for operating leases recorded in the balance sheet is included in operating costs and expenses and is based on the future minimum lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease plus any variable lease costs. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, operating lease expenses, inclusive of short-term and variable lease expenses, recognized in our consolidated statement of income were $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include lease costs associated with production activities or other amounts capitalized in our consolidated balance sheet, which were not material.\nThe table below summarizes the operating lease assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2021 2020\nOther noncurrent assets, net $ 6,467 $ 3,784\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 766 $ 718\nOther noncurrent liabilities $ 6,473 $ 3,740\nThe table below summarizes our future minimum lease commitments for operating leases as of December 31, 2021.\n(in millions) December 31,\n2022 $ 932\n2023 875\n2024 771\n2025 626\n2026 551\nThereafter 7,933\nTotal future minimum lease payments 11,688\nLess: imputed interest 4,449\nTotal liability $ 7,239\nThe weighted-average remaining lease terms for operating leases and the weighted-average discount rates used to calculate our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were 19 years and 3.94%, respectively, and as of December 31, 2020 were 9 years and 3.58%, respectively.\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, cash payments for operating leases recorded in the consolidated balance sheet were $987 million, $936 million and $914 million respectively. We recognized operating lease assets and liabilities of $2.8 billion related to Universal Beijing Resort in 2021. Lease assets and liabilities associated with other operating leases entered into or modified were not material in any period presented.\nContractual Obligation\nWe are party to a contractual obligation that involves an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks. The arrangement provides the counterparty with the right to periodic payments associated with current period revenue which are recorded as an operating expense, and beginning in June 2017, the option to require NBCUniversal to purchase the interest for cash in an amount based on a contractual formula. The contractual formula is based on an average of specified historical theme park revenue at the time of exercise, which amount could be significantly higher than our carrying value. As of December 31,\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\n2021, our carrying value was $1.1 billion, and the estimated value of the contractual obligation was $1.5 billion based on inputs to the contractual formula as of that date.\nRedeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we redeemed all of the NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. preferred stock and made cash payments equal to the aggregate liquidation preference of $725 million. As of December 31, 2020, the preferred stock had a carrying value equal to its liquidation preference and was presented in redeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation.\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K 96",
