    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nRoss Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\u201cwe\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) operate two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores-Ross Dress for Less\u00ae (\u201cRoss\u201d) and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS\u00ae.\nRoss is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,546 locations in 39 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, as of February 1, 2020. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. Ross\u2019 target customers are primarily from middle income households.\nWe also operate 259 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores in 19 states as of February 1, 2020. dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS features more moderately-priced first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day. The typical dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than Ross customers.\nThe merchant, store field, and distribution operations for Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS are separate. The two chains share certain corporate and support services.\nBoth our Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS brands target value-conscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54. The decisions we make, from merchandising, purchasing, and pricing, to the locations of our stores, are based on these customer profiles. We believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easy-to-shop store environments.\nOur mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives:\n\u2022Maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands, labels, and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.\n\u2022Meet customer needs on a local basis.\n\u2022Deliver an in-store shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.\n\u2022Manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets.\nWe refer to our fiscal years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018 as fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2017, respectively. Fiscal 2017 was a 53-week year. Fiscal 2019 and 2018 were each 52-week years.\nMerchandising, Purchasing, and Pricing\nWe seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand name and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices every day at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category. New merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores. Our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis, enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market. Our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising, which emphasizes a strong value message. Our stores offer a treasure-hunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home.\nMerchandising. Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-season, in-season, and past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS. We believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success. We generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell.\nWe have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores, we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles, and fabrics within each size or item. Our merchandise offerings include, but are not limited to, apparel (including footwear and accessories), small furniture, home accents, bed and bath, beauty, toys, luggage, gourmet food, cookware, jewelry and watches.\nPurchasing. We have a combined network of about 7,500 merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS and believe we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers, and we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory.\nWe believe our ability to effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our success. Our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for Ross, and moderate department and discount stores for dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS. By purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department, specialty, and discount stores, we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers\u2019 demand for products and manufacturers\u2019 supply of those products.\nUnlike most department and specialty stores, we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances, co-op advertising allowances, return privileges, split shipments, drop shipments to stores, or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For most orders, only one delivery is made to one of our distribution centers. These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on purchases.\nThe majority of the apparel and apparel-related merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season. These buys are referred to as \"close-out\" purchases. Close-outs can be shipped to stores in-season, allowing us to get in-season goods into our stores at great values, or can be stored as packaway merchandise.\nPackaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments. Packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and, therefore, not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends.\nIn fiscal 2019, we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately 46% of total inventories as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019. We believe the strong discounts we offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results.\nOur primary buying offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s two largest apparel markets. These strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis, sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers. These locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships-a key element to the success of our off-price buying strategies.\nAt the end of fiscal 2019, we had approximately 900 merchants for Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS combined. The Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS buying organizations are separate and distinct, and each includes merchandise management, buyers, and assistant buyers. Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS buyers have on average seven years of experience, including merchandising positions with other retailers such as Bloomingdale\u2019s, Burlington Stores, Kohl\u2019s, Lord & Taylor, Macy\u2019s, Saks, and Target. We expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors. Our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts.\nThe off-price buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase Ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores, and to purchase dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.\nPricing. Our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at Ross that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular prices. At dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20% to 70% below most moderate department and discount store regular prices. Our pricing policy is reflected on most of our price tags which display our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS merchandise.\nOur pricing strategy at Ross differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value. On a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale, as well as at the end of fashion seasons, to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores.\nStores\nAs of February 1, 2020, we operated a total of 1,805 stores comprised of 1,546 Ross stores and 259 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores. Our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas. Where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit, we cluster Ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising, distribution, and field management. We do the same for dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores.\nWe believe a key element of our success at both Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS is our organized, attractive, easy-to-shop, in-store environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace. While our stores promote a self-service, treasure-hunt shopping experience, the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation, dressing rooms, checkout, and merchandise return areas. Our store\u2019s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department. We enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers. Our stores have shopping carts and/or baskets available at the entrance for customer convenience. Cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing.\nWe accept a variety of payment methods. We provide refunds or store credit on all merchandise (not used, worn, or altered) returned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit.\nOperating Costs\nConsistent with the other aspects of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible. Among the factors which have enabled us to do this are: labor costs that are generally lower than full-price department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a self-service retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies; economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising, marketing, and purchasing decisions; and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats.\nInformation Systems\nWe continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years. Recent initiatives include continued enhancements to our information and data security, merchandising, distribution, transportation, store, and financial systems. These initiatives support future growth, the execution and achievement of our plans, as well as ongoing stability and compliance.\nDistribution\nWe operate distribution processing facilities where we receive and ship all of our merchandise to our stores. These distribution centers are large, highly automated, and built to suit our specific off-price business model. An additional distribution center in Brookshire, Texas is currently under construction and expected to open in 2021. We also operate warehouse facilities for packaway storage.\nWe utilize a combination of our own, and third-party, cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis. Shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location.\nWe believe that our distribution centers and warehouses with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing and storage capacity to support our current store growth. Information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under \u201cProperties\u201d in Item 2.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising for Ross Dress for Less relies primarily on television to communicate the Ross value proposition-savings off the same brands carried at leading department or specialty stores every day. This strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position. While television is our primary advertising medium, we continue to grow additional channels, including social and digital media, to communicate our brand position. Advertising for dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS is primarily focused on radio and new store grand openings.\nTrademarks\nThe trademarks for ROSS\u00ae, Ross Dress For Less\u00ae, and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS\u00ae have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\nEmployees\nAs of February 1, 2020, we had approximately 92,500 total employees, which includes both full- and part-time employees. Additionally, we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons. Our employees are non-union. Management considers the relationship between the Company and our employees to be good.\nCompetition\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise, offering a well-balanced assortment that appeals to our target customers, and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute this concept, we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization. We also continue to make improvements to our merchandising systems to strengthen our ability to plan, buy, and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends. We believe that we are well-positioned to compete based on each of these factors.\nNevertheless, the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face a challenging macro-economic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from on-line retailers, department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, warehouse stores, other off-price retailers, and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources. The retail apparel and home-related businesses may become even more competitive in the future.\nAvailable Information\nThe internet address for our corporate website is www.rossstores.com.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2019, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, and other investor communications, including those on our corporate website, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future events, including the rapidly developing challenges with and our plans and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, our financial performance, operations, competitive position, and our projected growth, that are all subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and from our prior expectations and projections. Refer to Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that apply to both Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the following:\nThe current, major health pandemic from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is severely and adversely affecting our sales and our operations, and will have serious adverse effects on our business and our financial condition.\nThe United States and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), and related, severe disruptions to retail operations and supply chains and to general economic activities, as the affected regions take increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our customers are impacted by recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state, and local authorities to stay home (\"shelter in place\" or \"safer at home\") and to avoid non-essential social contact and gatherings of people, and to self-quarantine. In recent weeks starting in March 2020, we have experienced a broad-based deceleration in sales trends from consumer response to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the country. Governmental authorities in affected regions are taking increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. As part of a growing number of retailers across the country, we have temporarily closed all store locations effective March 20, 2020 through April 3, 2020. We have closed our buying and corporate offices, and our distribution centers, for the same period, and we have instituted \u201cwork from home\u201d measures for many of our associates. We are monitoring the situation and will reopen stores as conditions permit; however, extended or further closures may be required nationally, regionally, or in specific locations. The situation is unprecedented and rapidly changing, and has unknown duration and severity. This significant reduction in customer visits to our stores will result in a loss of sales and profits and have material adverse effects to our financial condition. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic will potentially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff our stores and our distribution, merchant, and other support operations. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic is currently severely impacting China and other countries, which may also adversely affect our ability to access and ship products from the impacted countries. A prolonged, widespread pandemic will adversely impact global economies and financial markets, which will result in an economic downturn that will reduce demand for our products. The extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the U.S., the response by all levels of government in their efforts to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the economic disruptions, and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such impacts are expected to adversely affect our profitability, cash flows, financial results, and our capital resources.\nCompetitive pressures in the apparel and home-related merchandise retailing industry are high.\nThe retail industry is highly competitive and the marketplace is highly fragmented, as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store and on-line formats and merchandising strategies. We expect competition to increase in the future. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector. We compete for customers, associates, store locations, and merchandise with many other local, regional, and national retailers, traditional department stores, upscale mass merchandisers, other off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses, and other forms of retail commerce. Our retail competitors constantly adjust their pricing, business strategies and promotional activity (particularly during holiday periods) in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition. The substantial sales growth in e-commerce within the last decade has also encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models, and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful on-line shopping alternatives. Intense pressures from our competitors, our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, or a failure to effectively execute our off-price model, could reduce demand for our merchandise, decrease our inventory turnover, cause us to take greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins.\nUnexpected changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel and home-related merchandise could adversely affect us.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand. We work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences, and to obtain merchandise inventory to meet anticipated customer needs. It is very challenging to successfully do this well and consistently across our diverse merchandise categories and in the multiple markets in which we operate throughout the United States and its territories. Although our off-price business model provides us certain advantages and may allow us greater flexibility than traditional retailers have in adjusting our merchandise mix to ever-changing consumer tastes, our merchandising decisions may still fail to correctly anticipate and match consumer trends and preferences, particularly in our newer geographic markets. Failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends, preferences, and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAdverse and/or unseasonable weather may affect shopping patterns and consumer demand for seasonal apparel and other merchandise, and may result in temporary store closures and disruptions in deliveries of merchandise to our stores.\nUnseasonable weather and prolonged, extreme temperatures, as well as events such as storms, affect consumers\u2019 buying patterns and willingness to shop, and may adversely affect the demand for merchandise in our stores, particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise. Among other things, weather conditions may also affect our ability to deliver our products to our stores or require us to close certain stores temporarily, thereby reducing store traffic. Even if stores are not closed, many customers may be unable to go, or may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather. As a result, adverse or unseasonable weather in any of our markets could lead to disappointing sales and cause us to increase our markdowns, which may negatively affect our sales and margins.\nWe are subject to impacts from the macro-economic environment, financial and credit markets, and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and consumer disposable income.\nConsumer spending habits for the merchandise we sell are affected by many factors, including the reaction and repercussions from the COVID-19 pandemic, prevailing economic conditions, recession and fears of recession, levels of unemployment, salaries and wage rates, housing costs, energy and fuel costs, income tax rates and the timing of tax refunds, inflation, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security, availability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, and consumers\u2019 disposable income. The COVID-19 pandemic, or other potential, adverse developments in any of these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise, decrease our inventory turnover, cause greater markdowns, and negatively affect our sales and margins. All of our stores are located in the United States and its territories, so we are especially susceptible to changes in the U.S. economy.\nIn order to achieve our planned gross margins, we must effectively manage our inventories, markdowns, and inventory shortage.\nWe purchase the majority of our inventory based on our sales plans. If our actual demand is lower than our sales plans, we may experience excess inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slow-moving inventory, resulting in decreased profit margins. We also may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales opportunities. As a regular part of our business, we purchase \u201cpackaway\u201d inventory with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores varies by merchandise category and by season, but it typically remains in storage less than six months. Packaway inventory is frequently a significant portion of our overall inventory. If we make packaway purchases that\ndo not align with consumer preferences at the later time of release to our stores, we could have significant inventory markdowns. Changes in packaway inventory levels could impact our operating cash flow. Although we have various systems to help protect against loss or theft of our inventory, both when in storage and once distributed to our stores, we may have damaged, lost, or stolen inventory (called \u201cshortage\u201d) in higher amounts than we forecast, which would result in write-offs, lost sales, and reduced margins.\nWe depend on the market availability, quantity, and quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts, and on the ability of our buyers to purchase merchandise to enable us to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices.\nOpportunistic buying, lean inventory levels, and frequent inventory turns are critical elements of our off-price business strategy. Maintaining an overall pricing differential to department and specialty stores is also key to our ability to attract customers and sustain our sales and gross margins. Our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with our merchants, who are in the marketplace continually and who are generally purchasing merchandise for the current or upcoming season. Our ability to meet or exceed our operating performance targets depends upon the continuous, sufficient availability of high quality merchandise that we can acquire at prices sufficiently below those paid by conventional retailers and that represent a value to our customers. To the extent that certain of our vendors are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could be materially reduced. To the extent that certain of our vendors decide not to sell to us or go out of business, the amount of high quality merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced. Because a significant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries, changes in U.S. tariffs, trade relationships, or tax policies, and natural disasters, or public health issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other, future pandemics), that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of imported goods, could also result in disruptions to our existing supply relationships. Shortages or disruptions in the availability to us of high quality, value-priced merchandise would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales and margins.\nInformation or data security breaches, including cyber-attacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems, could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of customer, credit card, employee, or other private and valuable information that we handle in the ordinary course of our business, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and increase our costs.\nLike other large retailers, we rely on commercially available computer and telecommunications systems to process, transmit, and store payment card and other personal and confidential information, and to provide information or data security for those transactions. Some of the key information systems and processes we use to handle payment card transactions and check approvals, and the levels of security technology utilized in payment cards, are controlled by the banking and payment card industry, not by us. Cyber criminals may attempt to penetrate our point of sale and other information systems to misappropriate customer or business information, including but not limited to credit/debit card, personnel, or trade information. Despite security measures we have in place, and our efforts to prevent, monitor, and mitigate attacks and errors, our facilities and systems (or those of third-party service providers we utilize or connect to) may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, phishing and similar fraudulent attacks, or other similar events. It is also possible that an associate within our Company, or a third party we do business with, may purposefully or inadvertently cause a security breach involving such information. The increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and advances in computer capabilities and remote access increases these risks. A breach of our information or data security, a system shut down or other response we may take, or our failure or delay in detecting and mitigating a loss of personal or business information, could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customer confidence, violation (or alleged violation) of applicable laws, and expose us to civil claims, litigation, and regulatory action, and to unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations.\nDisruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and to deliver product to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nVarious information systems are critical to our ability to operate and to manage key aspects of our business. We depend on the integrity, continuous availability, and consistent operations of these systems to process transactions in our stores, track inventory flow, manage merchandise allocation and distribution logistics, generate performance and financial reports, and support merchandising decisions.\nWe are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace information processes and systems that are key to managing our business. We must monitor and choose sound investments and implement them at the right pace. The risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken. An excessive rate of technological change could detract from the effectiveness of\nadoption, and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from new technology. Poorly targeting opportunities, failing to make good investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could damage our competitive position and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology system changes could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide us with the anticipated benefits, or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.\nOur information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as severe storms, fires, earthquakes, floods, acts of terrorism, and design or usage errors by our employees or by third parties. If our information systems or our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to timely and efficiently transport merchandise to our stores or our distribution centers, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or increased supply chain costs. Such disruptions may result from: public health issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other, future pandemics), damage or destruction to our distribution centers, weather-related events, natural disasters, trade restrictions, tariffs, third-party strikes or ineffective cross dock operations, work stoppages or slowdowns, shipping capacity constraints, supply or shipping interruptions, or other factors beyond our control. Any such disruptions could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\nWe need to obtain acceptable new store sites with favorable consumer demographics to achieve our planned growth.\nSuccessful growth requires us to find appropriate real estate sites in our targeted market areas. We compete with other retailers and businesses for acceptable store locations. For the purpose of identifying locations we rely, in part, on consumer demographics. While we believe consumer demographics are helpful indicators of acceptable store locations, we recognize that this information cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy. Time frames for negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays or unexpected cancellations. We may not be able to open new stores or, if opened, operate those new stores profitably. Construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. Additionally, we may not be able to renegotiate our current lease terms which could negatively impact our operating results. New stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores, and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect the sales and profitability of other existing stores. If we cannot acquire sites on attractive terms, it could limit our ability to grow or adversely affect the economics of our new stores in various markets.\nTo achieve growth, we need to expand in existing markets and enter new geographic markets.\nOur growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our off-price model in current markets and in new geographic regions. There are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand our current business and to enter new markets. Stores we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy, advertising, or operating costs than stores we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our overall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes, and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. Our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may require us to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate, and retain qualified associates.\nConsumer problems or legal issues involving the quality, safety, or authenticity of products we sell could harm our reputation, result in lost sales, and/or increase our costs.\nVarious governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of merchandise we sell. These regulations and related laws frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. Because of our opportunistic buying strategy, we sometimes obtain merchandise in new categories or from new vendors that we have not dealt with before. Although our vendor arrangements typically place contractual responsibility on the vendor for resulting liability and we generally rely on our vendors to provide authentic merchandise that matches the stated quality attributes and complies with applicable product safety and other laws, vendor non-compliance with\nconsumer product safety laws may subject us to product recalls, make certain products unsalable, or require us to incur significant compliance costs.\nRegardless of fault, any real or perceived issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we offer, particularly products such as food and children\u2019s items, issues with the authenticity of merchandise, or our inability, or that of our vendors, to comply on a timely basis with laws and regulatory requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, result in lost sales, inventory write-offs, uninsured product liability or other legal claims, penalties or losses, merchandise recalls, and increased costs.\nAn adverse outcome in various legal, regulatory, or tax matters could damage our reputation or brand and increase our costs.\nAs an ordinary part of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, regulatory reviews, tax audits, or other legal matters. These may include lawsuits, inquiries, demands, or other claims or proceedings by governmental entities and private plaintiffs, including those relating to employment and employee benefits (including classification, employment rights, discrimination, harassment, wage and hour, and retaliation), securities, real estate, tort, commercial, consumer protection, privacy, product compliance and safety, advertising, comparative pricing, intellectual property, tax, escheat, and whistle-blower claims. We continue to be involved in a number of employment-related lawsuits, including class/representative actions which are primarily in California.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local rules and regulations in the United States, and to various international laws, which change from time to time. These legal requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business, including the cost of health care, workforce management and employee benefits, minimum wages, advertising, comparative pricing, import/export, sourcing and manufacturing, data protection, intellectual property, and others. If we fail to comply (or are alleged not to comply) with any of these requirements, we may be subject to fines, settlements, penalties, or other costs. In addition, an adverse outcome (or the adverse publicity from the claims) in any of these matters may damage our reputation or brand. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal, state, and local tax authorities, and these examining authorities may challenge positions we take.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax provisions and reserves for legal claims. Actual results may differ and our costs may exceed the reserves we establish in estimating the probable outcomes. In addition, applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time, and those changes could have material effects on our reported operating results and financial condition.\nDamage to our corporate reputation or brands could adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nOur reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity. Any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and business, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Such an incident could also include alleged acts or omissions by or situations involving our suppliers (or their contractors or subcontractors), the landlord for our stores, or our associates outside of work, and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business. The use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, continues to increase. The availability of information (whether correct or erroneous) on social media platforms is virtually immediate, as is its impact. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning our Company may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, which could negatively affect our sales, diminish customer trust, reduce employee morale and productivity, and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified associates. The harm may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nOur inability to continually attract, train, and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our off-price retail strategies along with labor shortages, increased turnover, or increased labor costs could adversely affect our operating results.\nLike other retailers, we face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent in our buying organization, management, stores, distribution centers, and other key areas. Many of our retail store associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing minimum wage or healthcare benefits.\nAny increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability or, if we fail to pay such higher wages, may result in increased turnover. Excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding, hiring, and training new associates. If we cannot hire enough qualified associates, or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from third-party providers, especially during our peak seasons, our operations could be negatively impacted.\nBecause of the distinctive nature of our off-price model, we must also attract, train, and retain our key associates across the Company, especially within our buying organization. The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor for a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our growth, operations, or financial position.\nWe must effectively advertise and market our business.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising and marketing activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands, and the location of our stores. Although we use marketing and advertising programs to attract customers to our stores, particularly through television, our competitors may spend more or use different approaches, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. Our advertising and other promotional programs may not be effective or may be perceived negatively, or could require increased expenditures, any of which could adversely affect sales or increase costs.\nWe are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries.\nRisks in importing and selling such merchandise include import duties and quotas, compliance with anti-dumping regulations, economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including inflation, recession, and exchange rate fluctuations), foreign government regulations, employment and labor matters, concerns relating to human rights, working conditions, and other issues in factories or countries where merchandise is produced, transparency of sourcing and supply chains, exposure on product warranty and intellectual property issues, consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise, wars and fears of war, political unrest, natural disasters, regulations to address climate change, and trade restrictions.\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell (even when we purchase it domestically, often as excess inventory sold to us by a domestic vendor) is originally manufactured in other countries. In addition, we directly source a portion of the products sold in our stores from foreign vendors predominantly in Asia (including China). We also buy products that originate from foreign sources indirectly through domestic vendors and manufacturers\u2019 representatives. Although our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors. When we are the importer of record, we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those applicable to a manufacturer.\nTo the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products, any event causing a disruption of imports, including the imposition of import restrictions, war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or public health issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other, future pandemics) could adversely affect our business. The flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured. Trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, or both, applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us. We cannot predict whether any of the countries from which our products are sourced, or in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future, will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments or the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions.\nWe require our vendors (for both import and domestic purchasing) to contractually confirm that they adhere to various conduct, compliance, and other requirements, including those relating to environmental, employment and labor (including wages and working conditions), health, safety, and anti-bribery standards. From time to time, our vendors, their contractors, or their subcontractors may be alleged to not be in compliance with these standards or with applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise, and to monitor our suppliers, this does not guarantee that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to claims and liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. tax or trade policy regarding apparel and home-related merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business.\nA predominant portion of the apparel and other goods we sell is originally manufactured in other countries. The U.S. government has at times indicated a willingness to significantly change existing trade policies, including those with China. This exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our merchandise, and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins. Changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships, or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost of goods and/or increase our effective tax rate. Although such changes would have implications across the entire industry, we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes. In addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business opportunities, or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes. These risks could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, increase our effective tax rates, and reduce our profitability.\nWe may experience volatility in revenues and earnings.\nOur business has slower and busier periods based on holiday and back-to-school seasons, weather, and other factors. Although our off-price business is historically subject to less seasonality than traditional retailers, we may still experience unexpected decreases in sales from time to time, which could result in increased markdowns and reduced margins. Significant operating expenses, such as rent expense and associate salaries, do not adjust proportionately with our sales. If sales in a certain period are lower than our plans, we may not be able to adjust these operating expenses concurrently, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nA pandemic, natural or man-made disaster in California or in another region where we have a concentration of stores, offices, or a distribution center could harm our business.\nOur corporate headquarters, Los Angeles buying office, nine distribution centers/warehouses, and approximately 23% of our stores are located in California. Natural or other disasters, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other, future pandemics), earthquakes and hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or other extreme weather and climate conditions, or fires, explosions, and acts of war or terrorism, or public health issues, in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or our supply chain, or could shut down, damage, or destroy our stores or distribution facilities. At the time of this filing, more than 40 million residents in California are under governmental orders to stay at home (\u201cshelter in place\u201d or \u201csafer at home\u201d) and to avoid non-essential social contact and gatherings of people. The duration of this situation is unknown, and it is severely and adversely affecting our sales and our financial results.\nTo support our continuing operations, our new store and distribution center growth plans, our quarterly dividends, and any resumption of our stock repurchase program, we must maintain sufficient liquidity; the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruption are adding significant uncertainty and challenges.\nWe depend upon our operations to generate strong cash flows to support our general operating activities, and to supply capital to finance our operations, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, manage our debt levels, and return value to our stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. In recent weeks starting in March 2020, we have experienced a broad-based deceleration in sales trends from consumer response to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the country. Governmental authorities in affected regions are taking increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. As part of a growing number of retailers across the country, we have temporarily closed all store locations effective March 20, 2020 through April 3, 2020. We have closed our buying and corporate offices, and our distribution centers, for the same period, and we have instituted \u201cwork from home\u201d measures for many of our associates. We are monitoring the situation and will reopen stores as conditions permit; however, extended or further closures may be required nationally, regionally, or in specific locations. The situation is unprecedented and rapidly changing, and has unknown duration and severity. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support our activities, our growth plans and our financial performance would be adversely affected. We have already temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program. If necessary to support our operations, we could be forced to discontinue payment of our quarterly cash dividends. The failure to repurchase stock, and any failure to pay dividends may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us, and may negatively affect our stock price.\nWe have borrowed on occasion to finance some of our activities. In March 2020, we borrowed $800 million from our revolving credit facility to add to our cash balances in order to provide enhanced financial flexibility due to uncertain market conditions arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, our operations, cash flows, and returns to stockholders could be adversely affected.",

PROPERTIES\nAt February 1, 2020, we operated a total of 1,805 stores, of which 1,546 were Ross stores in 39 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 259 were dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores in 19 states. All stores are leased, with the exception of two locations which we own.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we opened 74 new Ross stores and closed eight existing stores. The average approximate Ross store size is 28,000 square feet.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we opened 24 new dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores, closed one existing store, and temporarily closed one store impacted by a weather event. The average approximate dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS store size is 23,000 square feet.\nDuring fiscal 2019, no one store accounted for more than 1% of our sales.\nWe carry fire, flood, wind, and earthquake insurance to help mitigate the risk of financial loss that may result from such events.\nOur real estate strategy in 2020 is to primarily open stores in states where we currently operate, to increase our market penetration and leverage overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market. We also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in 2020. Important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites, demographic characteristics, competition, and population density of the local trade area. In addition, we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions.\nThe following table summarizes the locations of our stores by state/territory as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019.\nWhere possible, we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations, allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market. At February 1, 2020, the majority of our stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years, with three to four renewal options of five years each. The average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is approximately six years, or approximately 20 years if renewal options are included.

Actions filed against us may include commercial, product and product safety, consumer, intellectual property, environmental, and labor and employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal, state, and/or local laws. Actions against us are in various procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties.\nWe believe that the resolution of our pending class/representative action litigation and other currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nRoss Stores, Inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores-Ross Dress for Less\u00ae (\u201cRoss\u201d) and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS\u00ae. Ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States with 1,546 locations in 39 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, as of February 1, 2020. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. We also operate 259 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores in 19 states as of February 1, 2020 that feature a more moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day.\nOur primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term. In establishing appropriate growth targets for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the off-price industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers. Our sales and earnings gains in 2019 continued to benefit from efficient execution of our off-price model throughout all areas of our business. Our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the off-price industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day.\nWe refer to our fiscal years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018 as fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2017, respectively. Fiscal 2017 was a 53-week year. Fiscal 2019 and 2018 were each 52-week years.\nCurrent Material Development - the COVID-19 Pandemic is Disrupting Our Business\nThe United States and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19. Governmental authorities in affected regions are taking increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. As part of a growing number of retailers across the country, we have temporarily closed all store locations effective March 20, 2020 through April 3, 2020. We have closed our buying and corporate offices, and our distribution centers, for the same period, and we have instituted \u201cwork from home\u201d measures for many of our associates. We are monitoring the situation and will reopen stores as conditions permit; however, extended or further closures may be required nationally, regionally, or in specific locations. Given the unprecedented uncertainty of this situation, including the unknown duration and severity of the pandemic and the unknown overall impact on consumer demand, we are unable to forecast the full impact on our business; however, we now expect that impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic disruption will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position, and consolidated cash flows in fiscal 2020.\nTo preserve our financial liquidity, and out of an abundance of caution, we are temporarily suspending our stock repurchase program, and in mid-March 2020 we borrowed $800 million from our revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% (currently 1.61%), to add to our cash balances. In addition, we are reducing our expense, inventory receipts, and capital expenditure plans.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nStores. Total stores open at the end of fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were 1,805, 1,717, and 1,622, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 increased by 5%, 6%, and 6% from the respective prior years. Our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria.\nSales. Sales for fiscal 2019 increased $1.1 billion, or 7.0%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 88 net new stores during 2019 and a 3% increase in comparable store sales (defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for fiscal 2018 increased $0.8 billion, or 6.0%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 95 net new stores during 2018 and a 4% increase in sales from comparable stores.\nOur sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nWe intend to address the competitive climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our merchant organization, diversify our merchandise mix, and more fully develop our systems to improve our merchandise offerings. Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings.\nAs part of a growing number of retailers across the country, we have temporarily closed all store locations effective March 20, 2020 through April 3, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have closed our buying and corporate offices, and our distribution centers, for the same period, and we have instituted \u201cwork from home\u201d measures for many of our associates. Given the unprecedented uncertainty of this situation, including the unknown duration and severity of the pandemic, which may require extended and further store closures nationally, regionally, or in specific locations, and the unknown overall impact on consumer demand, we are unable to forecast the full impact on our business; however, we now expect that impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic disruption will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position, and consolidated cash flows in fiscal 2020.\nCost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2019 increased $809.9 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 88 net new stores during the year and a 3% increase in sales from comparable stores.\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 increased approximately 35 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in distribution expenses and a 15 basis point increase in freight costs. These increases were partially offset by a 10 basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin and a five basis point reduction in buying costs.\nCost of goods sold in fiscal 2018 increased $683.6 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 95 net new stores during the year and a 4% increase in sales from comparable stores.\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018 increased approximately 55 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 40 basis point increase in freight costs, a 15 basis point increase in distribution expenses, higher buying costs of 10 basis points, and higher occupancy costs of five basis points. These increases were partially offset by an increase of 15 basis points in merchandise gross margin.\nWe cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 will continue in future years.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d) increased $140.2 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 88 net new stores during the year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage on higher sales.\nFor fiscal 2018, SG&A increased $172.9 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 95 net new stores during the year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018 increased by approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher wages.\nInterest (income) expense, net. In fiscal 2019, net interest income improved by $7.9 million compared to 2018 primarily due to lower interest expense on long-term debt due to the repayment of the Series A 6.38% unsecured Senior Notes in December 2018 and higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center. In fiscal 2018, net interest income improved by $17.8 million compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in interest income and higher capitalized interest on information systems projects.\nThe table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTaxes on earnings. Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were approximately 23%, 23% and 33%, respectively. The effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting guidance, location of new stores, level of earnings, tax effects associated with share-based compensation, and the resolution of tax positions with various tax authorities. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 will be approximately 24%.\nIn November 2019, we resolved uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $10.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In fiscal 2018, we resolved uncertain federal tax positions related to fiscal 2015 with the Internal Revenue Service. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $26.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nIn fiscal 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d or \"tax reform\") was signed into law. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. corporate taxation including reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, the last month of fiscal 2017. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. We applied a U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% for fiscal 2018 and a blended U.S. federal income tax rate of approximately 34% for fiscal 2017. This reduced tax rate resulted in a benefit of $24.9 million in fiscal 2017. We recorded an additional tax benefit of $55.2 million due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2017.\nNet earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 were lower than in fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses and higher interest income. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018 were higher compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower taxes as a result of tax reform, and higher interest income, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold and higher SG&A expenses.\nEarnings per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 was $4.60, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.02 primarily related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, compared to $4.26 in the prior year, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter. The 8% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an increase of approximately 5% in net earnings and 3% from the reduction in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program.\nDiluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018 was $4.26, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.70 from tax reform and $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter, compared to $3.55 in the prior year, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.21 from tax reform and a $0.10 benefit from the 53rd week. The 20% increase in diluted earnings per share was attributable to an increase of approximately 16% in net earnings (which included a 14% impact from tax reform and a 2% impact from the favorable resolution of a tax matter) and 4% from the reduction in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program.\nFinancial Condition\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs previously noted, the United States and other countries are experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. Governmental authorities in affected regions are taking increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. As part of a growing number of retailers across the country, we have temporarily closed all store locations effective March 20, 2020 through April 3, 2020. We have closed our buying and corporate offices, and our distribution centers, for the same period, and we have instituted \u201cwork from home\u201d measures for many of our associates. We are monitoring the situation and will reopen stores as conditions permit; however, extended or further closures may be required nationally, regionally, or in specific locations. Given the unprecedented uncertainty of this situation, including the unknown duration and severity of the pandemic and the overall impact on consumer demand, we are unable to forecast the full impact on our business; however, this represents a known area of uncertainty and we now expect that impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic disruption will have a material adverse impact on our business. This uncertainty includes the potential need for significant additional capital resources to maintain our operations during a period of declining revenue from sales. We began fiscal 2020 with $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. To preserve our financial liquidity, we are temporarily suspending our stock repurchase program, and in mid-March 2020 we borrowed $800 million from our revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% (currently 1.61%), to add to our cash balances. In addition, we are reducing our expense, inventory receipts, and capital expenditure plans. We plan to continue to monitor the rapidly developing situation and to take further action to reduce our expenses and preserve our financial flexibility, as necessary.\nIn normal times and historically, our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, operating and variable lease costs, taxes, and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems, and buying and corporate offices. We also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends, and we may use cash for the repayment of debt as it becomes due. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, and with the temporary closure of all store locations effective March 20, 2020 through April 3, 2020, (and with extended or further closures possibly necessary), we anticipate that we will be required to rely far more heavily on our cash reserves and lines of credit, and we expect to carefully monitor and manage our cash position in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2,171.5 million, $2,066.7 million, and $1,681.3 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and for deferred taxes. Our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower-moving merchandise through clearance markdowns.\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year. The timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year resulted in accounts payable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory) of 71%, 67%, and 65% as of February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018, respectively.\nThe increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by higher earnings, the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus last year, and lower income tax payments.\nAs a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise purchase opportunities in the marketplace. Packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but in normal times and historically, packaway remains in storage less than six months. We expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers.\nChanges in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow. At the end of fiscal 2019, packaway inventory was 46% of total inventory compared to 46% and 49% at the end of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $555.0 million, $410.4 million, and $354.8 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures.\nIn fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, our capital expenditures were $555.5 million, $413.9 million, and $371.4 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures include costs to build, expand, and improve distribution centers, open new stores and improve existing stores, and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems, buying, and corporate offices. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers, and information technology infrastructure investments for our stores, buying, corporate offices, and transportation. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers, and information technology infrastructure investments for our stores, buying, corporate offices, and transportation. We opened 98, 99, and 96 new stores in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nIn November 2017, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction for one of our previously owned stores and received net cash proceeds of $16.0 million, recognized a gain on sale of $6.3 million, and deferred the residual $7.5 million gain over the remaining ten-year lease term. As of February 3, 2019, the effective date of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Accounting Standards Codification \"ASC\" 842), we wrote-off the remaining $6.5 million deferred gain on the sale-leaseback transaction that met the sale definition under ASC 842 to beginning retained earnings.\nOur capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below:\nAs previously noted, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, and to preserve our financial liquidity, we are reviewing and reducing our capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2020. Our capital expenditures would be to fund commitments related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center, costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open planned new Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores, investments in certain information technology systems, and for various other needed expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, buying, and corporate offices. We expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash, including cash we obtained by drawing from our revolving credit facility, and cash flows from operations.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,683.2 million, $1,531.5 million, and $1,149.4 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. During fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations.\nIn March 2019, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $2.55 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2020. As of the end of fiscal 2019, we have $1.275 billion remaining under the stock repurchase program. Due to the current economic uncertainty stemming from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are temporarily suspending our stock repurchase program.\nIn February 2017, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2018. In March 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2018 by $200 million to $1.075 billion, up from the previously available $875 million.\nWe repurchased 12.3 million, 12.5 million, and 13.5 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $1,275 million, $1,075 million, and $875 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We also acquired 0.6 million, 0.7 million, and 0.7 million shares in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs, for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $60.7 million, $54.4 million, and $45.4 million during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nOn March 3, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.285 per common share, payable on March 31, 2020. Our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.255 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2019, cash dividends of $0.225 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2018, and cash dividends of $0.160 per common share in February, May, August, and November 2017.\nDuring fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we paid dividends of $369.8 million, $337.2 million, and $247.5 million, respectively.\nOn December 13, 2018, we repaid at maturity the $85 million principal amount of the Series A 6.38% unsecured Senior Notes.\nShort-term trade credit normally represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, we face uncertainty about the levels of trade credit we can maintain and liquidity available from sales of merchandise. As noted below, we have drawn from our available bank lines to add to our current cash balance.\nIn July 2019, we entered into a new $800 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our previous $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility. This new credit facility expires in July 2024, and contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. The facility also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our revolving credit facility by up to an additional $300 million, with the agreement of the lenders. Interest on borrowings under this facility is based on LIBOR (or an alternate benchmark rate, if LIBOR is no longer available) plus an applicable margin (currently 75 basis points) and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. The revolving credit facility may be extended, at our option, for up to two additional one-year periods, subject to customary conditions. As of February 1, 2020, we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding on this facility and our $800 million credit facility remained in place and available.\nSubsequent to year end, in March 2020, we borrowed $800 million from our revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% (currently 1.61%), to add to our cash balances in order to provide enhanced financial flexibility due to uncertain market conditions arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe revolving credit facility is subject to a financial leverage ratio covenant. As of February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with this covenant.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, including the temporary closure of all of our store locations effective March 20, 2020 through April 3, 2020, (and with extended or further closures possibly necessary), are creating significant uncertainty and challenges. We believe that existing cash balances, cash flows\nfrom operations, bank credit lines, and trade credit are adequate to meet our near-term operating cash needs and capital investments; further prolonged and extensive temporary store closures may require access to additional corporate credit markets.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of February 1, 2020:\nOther than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as of February 1, 2020.\nSenior notes. As of February 1, 2020, we had outstanding unsecured 3.375% Senior Notes due September 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually.\nAs of February 1, 2020, we also had outstanding Series B unsecured Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $65 million, held by various institutional investors. The Series B notes are due in December 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%. Borrowings under these Senior Notes are subject to certain financial covenants, including interest coverage and other financial ratios. As of February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with those covenants.\nThe 2024 Notes, and Series B Senior Notes are subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of principal.\nStandby letters of credit and collateral trust. We use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition to a funded trust to collateralize our insurance obligations. As of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, we had $4.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding and $56.0 million and $58.3 million, respectively, in a collateral trust. The standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nTrade letters of credit. We had $11.2 million and $13.3 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively.\nEffects of inflation or deflation. We do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations.\nOther\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), with no need for management\u2019s judgment in their application. There are also areas in which management\u2019s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contain descriptions of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP.\nMerchandise inventory. Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis) or net realizable value. We purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the Company\u2019s store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately 46%, 46%, and 49% of total inventories as of February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018, respectively. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory.\nIncluded in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions, markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required.\nLong-lived assets. We review our long-lived assets for a potential impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment loss would be recognized to write the asset group down to its fair value. If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. For stores that are closed, we record an impairment charge, if appropriate, or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset. In the course of performing our annual analysis, we determined that no long-lived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nLease accounting. As our leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate; we use the estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. This rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. We believe that this is the rate we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term. Operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. We do not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less, and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Our lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nPrior to our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 842 in the beginning of fiscal 2019, when a lease contained \u201crent holidays\u201d or required fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we recorded rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount was charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease was recorded as deferred rent. We began recording\nrent expense on the lease possession date. Tenant improvement allowances were amortized over the lease term. Changes in deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances were included as a component of operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See \"Recently adopted accounting standards\" below.\nInsurance obligations. We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. Our self-insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required.\nIncome taxes. We account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740. We are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Our policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense. To the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made.\nRecently issued accounting standards. We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (\u201cASU\u201d) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial results.\nRecently adopted accounting standards. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), which along with subsequent amendments, supersedes the lease accounting requirements in ASC 840, Leases. The updated guidance requires balance sheet recognition for all leases with lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability, which is a lessee\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset that represents the lessee\u2019s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.\nWe adopted ASC 842 as of February 3, 2019 (the \"effective date\"), using the optional transition method on a modified retrospective basis. We did not elect the transitional package of practical expedients or the use of hindsight upon adoption of the ASC. We elected to not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less, and to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Upon adoption, we recorded lease liabilities based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments, using incremental borrowing rates as of the effective date, of $2.9 billion, and the corresponding right-of-use assets of $2.9 billion. We also recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease beginning retained earnings of $19.6 million, primarily related to the write-off of previously capitalized initial direct costs that are no longer capitalized under ASC 842, partially offset by the write-off of the deferred gain on a previous sale-leaseback transaction that meets the sale definition under ASC 842. Reporting periods beginning on or after February 3, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts and disclosures were not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC 840. Adoption of ASC 842 did not have a significant impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of earnings or to the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) which, along with subsequent amendments, supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in \u201cRevenue Recognition (ASC 605).\u201d This guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized and requires entities to recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted ASC 606 as of February 4, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after February 4, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605. Upon adoption of ASC 606, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase beginning retained earnings by $20 million as of February 4, 2018, primarily due to the change in the timing of the recognition of stored value card breakage. The impact of applying ASC 606 was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The standard also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-18 as of February 4, 2018, using the retrospective method.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 provides for changes to accounting for stock compensation including 1) excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards will be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the reporting period in which they occur (previously such amounts were recognized in additional paid-in capital); 2) excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows; and 3) the option to elect to estimate forfeitures or account for them when they occur. The impact of recording excess tax benefits in income taxes in our consolidated statement of earnings may be material, depending upon our future stock price on vest date in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and our future grants of stock-based compensation.\nWe adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and elected to apply this adoption prospectively, except for forfeitures which we adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Accordingly, prior periods have not been adjusted. As a result of adoption, for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, we recognized $16.3 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based payments as a reduction to our provision for income taxes. These items were historically recorded in additional paid-in capital. We also presented cash flows related to excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and elected to account for forfeitures as incurred beginning on January 29, 2017. The impact of this accounting policy election for forfeitures was a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings by $1.1 million as of January 29, 2017.\nForward-Looking Statements\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2019, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, and other investor communications including those on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements regarding, without limitation, the rapidly developing challenges and our plans and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, planned store growth, new markets, expected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures, and other matters.

    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward contracts as of February 1, 2020.\nInterest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of February 1, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nAs of February 1, 2020, we have one outstanding series of unsecured 6.53% Series B Senior Notes due December 2021 with an aggregate principal amount of $65 million. We also have unsecured 3.375% Senior Notes due September 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. Interest that is payable on our Senior Notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore unaffected by changes in market interest rates.\nWe receive interest on our short- and long-term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or the fair values of our short- and long-term investments as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near-term changes in interest rates to be material.",
    "item_8": "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness. Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is an off-price retailer of first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. At the end of fiscal 2019, the Company operated 1,546 Ross Dress for Less\u00ae (\u201cRoss\u201d) locations in 39 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, and 259 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS\u00ae stores in 19 states. The Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores are supported by the Company\u2019s headquarters, buying offices, and its network of distribution centers/warehouses.\nSegment reporting. The Company has one reportable segment. The Company\u2019s operations include only activities related to off-price retailing in stores throughout the United States.\nBasis of presentation and fiscal year. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company follows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018 are referred to as fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2017, respectively. Fiscal 2017 was a 53-week year. Fiscal 2019 and 2018 were each 52-week years.\nUse of accounting estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company\u2019s significant accounting estimates include valuation reserves for inventory shortage, packaway inventory costs, useful lives of fixed assets, insurance reserves, reserves for uncertain tax positions, and legal claims.\nPurchase obligations. As of February 1, 2020, the Company had purchase obligations of approximately $2.7 billion. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction projects, store fixtures and supplies, and information technology services, transportation, and maintenance contracts.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments serve as collateral for certain insurance obligations of the Company. These restricted funds are invested in bank deposits, money market mutual funds, U.S. Government and agency securities, and corporate securities and cannot be withdrawn from the Company\u2019s account without the prior written consent of the secured parties. The classification between current and long-term is based on the timing of expected payments of the insurance obligations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets that reconcile to the amounts shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nIn addition to the restricted cash and cash equivalents in the table above, the Company had restricted investments of $0.4 million as of February 2, 2019 included in Prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had no restricted investments as of February 1, 2020.\nEstimated fair value of financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, accounts receivable, other long-term assets, accounts payable, and other long-term liabilities approximates their estimated fair value. See Note B and Note D for additional fair value information.\nCash and cash equivalents were $1,351.2 million and $1,412.9 million, at February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively, and include bank deposits and money market funds for which the fair value was determined using quoted prices for identical assets in active markets, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance.\nInvestments. The Company\u2019s investments are comprised of various debt securities. At February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, these investments were classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Investments are classified as either short- or long-term based on their maturity dates and the Company\u2019s intent. Investments with a maturity of less than one year are classified as short-term. See Note B for additional information.\nMerchandise inventory. Merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis) or net realizable value. The Company purchases inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to the stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the Company\u2019s store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory. The cost of the Company\u2019s merchandise inventory is reduced by valuation reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the Company\u2019s physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.\nCost of goods sold. In addition to product costs, the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution, and freight expenses as well as occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related to the Company\u2019s retail stores, buying, and distribution facilities. Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses include the cost of operating the Company\u2019s distribution centers, warehouses, and cross-dock facilities.\nProperty and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment, 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, and three to seven years for computer software costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $350.9 million, $330.4 million, and $313.2 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The Company capitalizes interest during the construction period of facilities and during the development and implementation phase of software projects. Interest capitalized was $4.4 million, $2.5 million, and $0.7 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As of February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018 the Company had $40.3 million, $33.7 million, and $24.3 million, respectively, of property and equipment purchased but not yet paid. These purchases are included in Property and Equipment and in Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther long-term assets. Other long-term assets as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 consisted of the following:\nImpairment of long-lived assets. Property and other long-term assets that are subject to depreciation and amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. For stores that are closed, the Company records an impairment charge, if appropriate, or accelerates depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Based on the Company\u2019s evaluation during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, no impairment charges were recorded.\nAccounts payable. Accounts payable represents amounts owed to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable includes book cash overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for payment) in excess of cash balances in such accounts of approximately $138.8 million and $83.2 million at February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts in operating cash flows.\nInsurance obligations. The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. The self-insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insurance and deductible reserves as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 consisted of the following:\nWorkers\u2019 compensation and self-insured medical plan liabilities are included in Accrued payroll and benefits and accruals for general liability are included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther long-term liabilities. Other long-term liabilities as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 consisted of the following:\nLease accounting. As the Company\u2019s leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company uses the estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. This rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. The Company believes that this is the rate it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term. Operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company does not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less, and accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Company's lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nPrior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification \"ASC\" 842 in the beginning of fiscal 2019, when a lease contained \u201crent holidays\u201d or required fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, the Company recorded rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount was charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease was recorded as deferred rent. The Company began recording rent expense on the lease possession date. Tenant improvement allowances were amortized over the lease term. Changes in deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances were included as a component of operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRevenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale, net of sales taxes collected and an allowance for estimated future returns as required by ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The Company recognizes allowances for estimated sales returns on a gross basis as a reduction to sales. The asset recorded for the expected recovery of merchandise inventory was $10.7 million and $10.2 million and the liability recorded for the refund due to the customer was $20.9 million and $19.8 million as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, the Company recognized allowances for sales returns on a net margin basis, which was $9.9 million as of February 3, 2018. Sales taxes collected that are outstanding and the allowance for estimated future returns are included in Accrued expenses and other and the asset for expected recovery of merchandise is included in Prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSales of stored value cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of Company merchandise. The Company\u2019s stored value cards do not have expiration dates. Based upon historical redemption rates, a small percentage of stored value cards will never be redeemed, which represents breakage. As a result of adopting ASC 606, breakage is estimated and recognized as revenue based upon the historical pattern of customer redemptions. In prior periods, breakage was recorded as a reduction of operating expense when customer redemption was considered remote. Breakage was not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nThe following sales mix table disaggregates revenue by merchandise category for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nStore pre-opening. Store pre-opening costs are expensed in the period incurred.\nAdvertising. Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $74.0 million, $79.9 million, and $76.4 million, respectively.\nStock-based compensation. The Company recognizes compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards, typically over the vesting period. See Note C for more information on the Company\u2019s stock-based compensation plans.\nTaxes on earnings. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cAccounting for Income Taxes,\u201d which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates. ASC 740 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. See Note F.\nTreasury stock. The Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax withholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock grants.\nEarnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d). The Company computes and reports both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution that could occur from outstanding equity plan awards, including unexercised stock options and unvested shares of both performance and non-performance based awards of restricted stock.\nIn fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 there were 27,400, 23,700, and 2,800 weighted-average shares, respectively, that were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for those years.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:\nComprehensive income. Comprehensive income includes net earnings and components of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, consisting of unrealized investment gains or losses.\nRecently issued accounting standards. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (\u201cASU\u201d) issued by the FASB. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's consolidated financial results.\nRecently adopted accounting standards. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), which along with subsequent amendments, supersedes the lease accounting requirements in ASC 840, Leases. The updated guidance requires balance sheet recognition for all leases with lease terms greater than one year including a lease liability, which is a lessee\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee\u2019s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 as of February 3, 2019 (the \"effective date\"), using the optional transition method on a modified retrospective basis. The Company did not elect the transitional package of practical expedients or the use of hindsight upon adoption of the ASC. The Company elected to not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less, and to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Upon adoption, the Company recorded lease liabilities based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments, using incremental borrowing rates as of the effective date, of $2.9 billion, and the corresponding right-of-use assets of $2.9 billion. The Company also recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease beginning retained earnings of $19.6 million, primarily related to the write-off of previously capitalized initial direct costs that are no longer capitalized under ASC 842, partially offset by the write-off of the deferred gain on a previous sale-leaseback transaction that meets the sale definition under ASC 842. Reporting periods beginning on or after February 3, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts and disclosures were not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC 840. Adoption of ASC 842 did not have a significant impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of earnings or to the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) which, along with subsequent amendments, supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in \u201cRevenue Recognition (ASC 605).\u201d This guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized and requires entities to recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASC 606 as of February 4, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after February 4, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605. Upon adoption of ASC 606, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to increase beginning retained earnings by $20 million as of February 4, 2018, primarily due to the change in the timing of the recognition of stored value card breakage. The impact of applying ASC 606 was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 2, 2019.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The standard also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 as of February 4, 2018, using the retrospective method.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 provides for changes to accounting for stock compensation including 1) excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards will be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the reporting period in which they occur (previously such amounts were recognized in additional paid-in capital); 2) excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows; and 3) the option to elect to estimate forfeitures or account for them when they occur. The impact of recording excess tax benefits in income taxes in the Company's consolidated statement of earnings may be material, depending upon the Company's future stock price on vest date in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and the future grants of stock-based compensation.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and elected to apply this adoption prospectively, except for forfeitures which it adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Accordingly, prior periods have not been adjusted. As a result of adoption, for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, the Company recognized $16.3 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based payments as a reduction to its provision for income taxes. These items were historically recorded in additional paid-in capital. The Company also presented cash flows related to excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and elected to account for forfeitures as incurred beginning on January 29, 2017. The impact of this accounting policy\nelection for forfeitures was a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings by $1.1 million as of January 29, 2017.\nReclassifications. Certain items related to income taxes in the prior year\u2019s consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.\nNote B: Investments and Restricted Investments\nAccounting standards pertaining to fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The inputs used to measure fair value include: Level 1, observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists. This fair value hierarchy requires the Company to develop its own assumptions and maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Corporate, U.S. government and agency, and mortgage-backed securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because these securities are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.\nThere were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 categories during the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. The fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 are as follows:\nThe underlying assets in the Company\u2019s non-qualified deferred compensation program as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 (included in Other long-term assets and in Other long-term liabilities) primarily consist of participant-directed money market, stable value, stock, and bond funds. The fair value measurement for funds with quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) and for funds without quoted market prices in active markets (Level 2) are as follows:\nNote C: Stock-Based Compensation\nFor fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nCapitalized stock-based compensation cost was not significant in any year.\nAt February 1, 2020, the Company had one active stock-based compensation plan, which is further described in Note H. The Company recognizes expense for ESPP purchase rights equal to the value of the 15% discount given on the purchase date.\nTotal stock-based compensation recognized in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 is as follows:\nThe tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $18.5 million, $19.6 million, and $29.5 million, respectively.\nNote D: Debt\nSenior notes. Unsecured senior debt, net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 consisted of the following:\nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company had outstanding Series B unsecured Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $65 million, held by various institutional investors. The Series B notes are due in December 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%. Borrowings under these Senior Notes are subject to certain financial covenants, including interest coverage and other financial ratios. As of February 1, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company also had outstanding unsecured 3.375% Senior Notes due September 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d) with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually.\nOn December 13, 2018, the Company repaid at maturity the $85 million principal amount of the Series A 6.38% unsecured Senior Notes.\nAs of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, total unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were $2.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively, and were classified as a reduction of long-term debt.\nThe 2024 Notes, and the Series B Senior Notes are subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of principal.\nThe aggregate fair value of the two outstanding series of Senior Notes was approximately $335 million and $316 million as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively. The fair value is estimated by obtaining comparable market quotes which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance.\nThe following table shows scheduled annual principal payments on long-term debt:\nThe table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nRevolving credit facility. In July 2019, the Company entered into a new $800 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the Company's previous $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility. This new credit facility expires in July 2024, and contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. The facility also contains an option allowing the Company to increase the size of its credit facility by up to an additional $300 million, with the agreement of the lenders. Interest on borrowings under this facility is based on LIBOR (or an alternate benchmark rate, if LIBOR is no longer available) plus an applicable margin (currently 75 basis points) and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. As of February 1, 2020, the Company had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility and the $800 million credit facility remained in place and available.\nSubsequent to year end, in March 2020, the Company borrowed $800 million from its revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% (currently 1.61%), to add to its cash balances in order to provide enhanced financial flexibility due to uncertain market conditions arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe revolving credit facility is subject to a financial leverage ratio covenant. As of February 1, 2020, the Company was in compliance with this covenant.\nStandby letters of credit and collateral trust. The Company uses standby letters of credit outside of its revolving credit facility in addition to a funded trust to collateralize its insurance obligations. As of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, the Company had $4.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit and $56.0 million and $58.3 million, respectively, in a collateral trust. The standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nTrade letters of credit. The Company had $11.2 million and $13.3 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively.\nNote E: Leases\nThe Company currently leases all but two of its store locations with original, non-cancelable terms that in general range from three to ten years. Store leases typically contain provisions for three to four renewal options of five years each. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the sole discretion of the Company. Most store leases also provide for minimum annual rentals and for payment of variable lease costs. In addition, some store leases also have provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of sales (\"percentage rent\") and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company does not have any financing leases.\nIn November 2017, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback transaction on one of its previously owned stores. The Company received net cash proceeds of $16.0 million, recognized a gain on sale of $6.3 million, and deferred the residual $7.5 million gain over the remaining ten-year lease term. As of February 3, 2019, the effective date of the adoption of ASC 842, the Company wrote-off the remaining $6.5 million deferred gain on the sale-leaseback transaction that met the sale definition under ASC 842 to beginning retained earnings.\nThe Company leases nine distribution centers/warehouses. All of these contain renewal provisions, except for the third-party warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The following table summarizes the location and expiration date of the Company's leased warehouses:\nThe Company leases approximately 103,000 and 5,000 square feet of office space for its Los Angeles and Boston buying offices, respectively. The lease term for both of these facilities expire in 2022, and contain renewal provisions. In addition, the Company has a ground lease related to its New York buying office.\nThe following table presents net operating lease costs included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for fiscal 2019:\nThe maturity of operating lease liabilities, including the ground lease related to the New York buying office as of February 1, 2020, are as follows:\nAt February 1, 2020, the weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate for operating leases is 10.7 years and 3.5%, respectively. The weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate, excluding the long-term ground lease related to the New York buying office, were 6.1 years and 3.1%, respectively.\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $608.6 million for fiscal 2019 and is included in Net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities (includes new leases and remeasurements or modifications of existing leases) during fiscal 2019 was $739.3 million.\nIn accordance with ASC 840, the aggregate undiscounted future minimum annual lease payments under leases, including the ground lease related to the New York buying office, in effect at February 2, 2019 are as follows:\nRent expense under ASC 840, including contingent rent and net of sublease income, was $569.8 million and $532.4 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Contingent rent and sublease income was not significant in any year.\nNote F: Taxes on Earnings\nThe provision for income taxes consisted of the following:\nThe provision for taxes for financial reporting purposes is different from the tax provision computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate. The differences are reconciled below:\nIn November 2019, the Company resolved uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority. As a result, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $10.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In fiscal 2018, the Company resolved uncertain tax positions related to fiscal 2015 with the Internal Revenue Service. As a result, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $26.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nIn fiscal 2017, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d or \"tax reform\") was signed into law. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. corporate taxation including reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, the last month of fiscal 2017. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. The Company applied a blended U.S. federal income tax rate of approximately 34% for fiscal 2017. This reduced tax rate resulted in a tax benefit of $24.9 million in fiscal 2017. The Company recorded an additional tax benefit of $55.2 million due to the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2017.\nAlso, in fiscal 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09. Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company recorded tax benefits related to employee equity programs in additional paid-in capital. As a result of adopting ASU 2016-09, the Company recorded tax benefits of $13.3 million, $12.6 million and $16.3 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a reduction to its provision for income taxes.\nThe components of deferred taxes at February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 are as follows:\nAt the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018, the Company\u2019s state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $12.8 million and $13.6 million, respectively. The state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2020. The Company has provided a valuation allowance of $4.6 million as of the end of fiscal 2019 for deferred tax assets related to state tax credits that are not expected to be realized.\nThe changes in amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (gross of federal tax benefits and excluding interest and penalties) at fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 are as follows:\nAt the end of fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits were $67.1 million, $78.8 million, and $121.3 million inclusive of $7.2 million, $13.0 million, and $22.6 million of related reserves for interest and penalties, respectively. In November 2019, the Company resolved uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority. As a result, the Company recognized a decrease in reserves for tax positions in prior periods of $16.2\nmillion, inclusive of $6.6 million of related reserves for interest and penalties. In fiscal 2018, the Company resolved uncertain tax positions related to fiscal 2015 with the Internal Revenue Service. As a result, the Company recognized a decrease in reserves for tax positions in prior periods of $52.4 million, inclusive of $12.6 million of related reserves for interest and penalties. The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a part of its provision for taxes on earnings. If recognized, $53.3 million would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. The difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amounts that would impact the effective tax rate relates to amounts attributable to deferred tax assets and liabilities. These amounts are net of federal and state income taxes.\nIt is reasonably possible that certain state tax matters may be concluded or statutes of limitations may lapse during the next twelve months. Accordingly, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $10.3 million.\nThe Company is open to audit by the Internal Revenue Service under the statute of limitations for fiscal years 2016 through 2019. The Company\u2019s state income tax returns are generally open to audit under the various statutes of limitations for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. Certain state tax returns are currently under audit by various tax authorities. The Company does not expect the results of these audits to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nNote G: Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a defined contribution plan that is available to certain employees. Under the plan, employee and Company contributions and accumulated plan earnings qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan permits employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches up to 4% of the employee\u2019s salary up to the plan limits. Company matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were $19.2 million, $17.1 million, and $15.4 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company also has an Incentive Compensation Plan which provides cash awards to key management and employees based on Company and individual performance.\nThe Company also makes available to management a Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan which allows management to make payroll contributions on a pre-tax basis in addition to the 401(k) plan. Other long-term assets include $141.4 million and $124.6 million at February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively, of long-term plan investments, at market value, set aside or designated for the Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (See Note B). Plan investments are designated by the participants, and investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company. The Company has a corresponding liability to participants of $141.4 million and $124.6 million at February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively, included in Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn addition, the Company has certain individuals who receive or will receive post-employment medical benefits. The estimated liability for these benefits of $8.2 million and $6.7 million is included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively.\nNote H: Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nCommon stock. In March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-year $2.55 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2020. As of the end of fiscal 2019, the Company has $1.275 billion remaining under the stock repurchase program. Due to the current economic uncertainty stemming from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is temporarily suspending its stock repurchase program. In February 2017, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a two-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2018. In March 2018, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2018 by $200 million to $1.075 billion, up from the previously available $875 million.\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nPreferred stock. The Company has 4.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized, with a par value of $.01 per share. No preferred stock is issued or outstanding.\nDividends. On March 3, 2020, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.285 per common share, payable on March 31, 2020. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.255 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2019, cash dividends of $0.225 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2018, and cash dividends of $0.160 per common share in February, May, August, and November 2017.\n2017 Equity Incentive Plan. On May 17, 2017, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the Ross Stores, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2017 Plan\u201d) which replaced the Company\u2019s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (\u201cPredecessor Plan\u201d). The 2017 Plan, which was authorized to issue a maximum of 12.0 million shares, was immediately effective upon approval and no further awards were granted under the Predecessor Plan, which was terminated.\nThe 2017 Plan has an initial share reserve of 12.0 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock which can be increased by a maximum of 5.5 million shares from certain expired, withheld, or forfeited shares from the 2017 Plan or the Predecessor Plan. The 2017 Plan provides for various types of incentive awards, which may potentially include the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and deferred compensation awards. As of February 1, 2020, there were 10.7 million shares available for grant under the 2017 Plan.\nA summary of restricted stock and performance share award activity for fiscal 2019 is presented below:\nThe market value of shares of restricted stock and performance shares at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period of generally three to five years. The unamortized compensation expense at February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 was $158.4 million and $138.1 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of 2.0 years. Intrinsic value for restricted stock, defined as the closing market value on the last business day of fiscal year 2019 (or $112.19), was $493.0 million. A total of 10.7 million, 11.2 million, and 11.9 million shares were available for new restricted stock awards at the end of fiscal 2019, 2018,\nand 2017, respectively. During fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, shares purchased by the Company for tax withholding totaled 0.6 million, 0.7 million, and 0.7 million shares, respectively, and are considered treasury shares which are available for reissuance. As of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, the Company held 13.8 million and 13.2 million shares of treasury stock, respectively.\nPerformance share awards. The Company has a performance share award program for senior executives. A performance share award represents a right to receive shares of restricted stock on a specified settlement date based on the Company\u2019s attainment of a profitability-based performance goal during the performance period, which is the Company\u2019s fiscal year. If attained, the restricted stock then vests over a service period, generally two to three years from the date the performance award was granted. The Company issued approximately 414,000, 556,000, and 655,000 shares in settlement of the fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 awards.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d), eligible employees participating in the quarterly offering period can choose to have up to the lesser of 10% of their annual base earnings or the IRS annual share purchase limit of $25,000 in aggregate market value to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the closing market price on the date of purchase. Purchases occur on a quarterly basis (on the last trading day of each calendar quarter). The Company recognizes expense for ESPP purchase rights equal to the value of the 15% discount given on the purchase date.\nDuring fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, employees purchased approximately 0.3 million, 0.3 million, and 0.3 million shares, respectively, of the Company\u2019s common stock under the plan at weighted-average per share prices of $88.45, $72.89, and $56.42, respectively. Through February 1, 2020, approximately 40.2 million shares had been issued under this plan and 4.8 million shares remained available for future issuance.\nNote I: Related Party Transactions\nThe Company has a consulting agreement with Norman Ferber, its Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Directors, under which the Company paid him $2.1 million, $1.9 million, and $1.6 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In addition, the agreement provides for administrative support and health and other benefits for him and his dependents, which totaled approximately $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, along with amounts to cover premiums through May 2021 on a life insurance policy with a death benefit of $2.0 million. Mr. Ferber's current consulting agreement pays him an annual consulting fee of $2.3 million through May 2021. On termination of Mr. Ferber\u2019s consultancy with the Company, the Company will pay Mr. Ferber $75,000 per year for a period of 10 years.\nRobert Ferber, the son of Norman Ferber, is a buyer with the Company. The Company paid Robert Ferber compensation including salary and bonus of approximately $209,000, $180,000, and $159,000 in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nNote J: Litigation, Claims, and Assessments\nLike many retailers, the Company has been named in class/representative action lawsuits, primarily in California, alleging violation of wage and hour laws and consumer protection laws. Class/representative action litigation remains pending as of February 1, 2020.\nThe Company is also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions filed against the Company may include commercial, product and product safety, consumer, intellectual property, environmental, and labor and employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that the Company violated federal, state, and/or local laws. Actions against the Company are in various procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties.\nIn the opinion of management, the resolution of pending class/representative action litigation and other currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNote K: Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nSummarized quarterly financial information for fiscal 2019 and 2018 is presented in the tables below.\nYear ended February 1, 2020:\n\u00b9 EPS is computed independently for each of the quarters presented. The sum of the quarters may not equal the total year amount due to the impact of changes in average quarterly shares outstanding.\n\u00b2 Includes a per share benefit of approximately $0.02 primarily related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter.\nYear ended February 2, 2019:\n\u00b9 EPS is computed independently for each of the quarters presented. The sum of the quarters may not equal the total year amount due to the impact of changes in average quarterly shares outstanding.\n\u00b2 Includes a per share benefit of approximately $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.\nNote L: Subsequent Events\nThe United States and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19. Governmental authorities in affected regions are taking increasingly dramatic action in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. As part of a growing number of retailers across the country, the Company has temporarily closed all store locations effective March 20, 2020 through April 3, 2020. The Company has closed its buying and corporate offices, and its distribution centers, for the same period. The Company is monitoring the situation and will reopen stores as conditions permit; however, extended or further closures may be required nationally, regionally, or in specific locations. Given the unprecedented uncertainty of this situation, including the unknown duration and severity of the pandemic and the unknown overall impact on consumer demand, the Company is unable to forecast the full impact on its business; however, the Company now expects that impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic disruption will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position, and consolidated cash flows in fiscal 2020.\nDue to the current economic uncertainty stemming from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to provide enhanced financial flexibility, the Company borrowed $800 million from its revolving credit facility in March 2020, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% (currently 1.61%), and is temporarily suspending its stock repurchase program.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ross Stores, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note A to the financial statements, effective February 3, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASC 842, Leases, using the modified retrospective basis. Recently adopted accounting standards - ASC 842, Leases, is also communicated as a critical audit matter below.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying \u201cManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\u201d Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRecently adopted accounting standards - ASC 842, Leases - Incremental Borrowing Rate - Refer to Note A and Note E to the consolidated financial statements (also see Change in Accounting Principle explanatory paragraph above)\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company adopted the provisions of ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), as of February 3, 2019. The Company recorded lease liabilities for the present value of its lease commitments and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets of approximately $2.9 billion, upon adoption. The Company developed estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rates (IBR) for each lease portfolio to present value the lease payments as required by ASC 842 when the discount rate is not implicit in the lease. The determination of an IBR required management to use significant estimates and assumptions including its credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral.\nWe identified the IBRs used in the adoption of ASC 842 as a critical audit matter because of the significant impact of management\u2019s assumptions and estimates in determining the selected IBRs for each lease portfolio and the related material impact upon the lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets recorded upon adoption.\nManagement\u2019s assumptions and estimates used in determining the selected IBRs were the Company\u2019s credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. Given these significant judgments made by management in determining the IBR, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the methods and assumptions related to these assumptions and estimates involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the IBRs used in the adoption of ASC 842 included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBRs, including those over the credit rating, credit spreads and adjustments for the impact of collateral.\n\u2022With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBRs and tested the inputs used by management to develop the IBRs as follows:\n- Assessed the reasonableness of the methodology and models used to estimate the IBRs based on\nthe definition and guidance in ASC 842 and other reference materials.\n- Assessed the reasonableness of the significant inputs used to estimate the IBRs by comparing to\nCompany specific benchmarks, comparable companies and other market information:\n\u25e6The credit rating ascribed to the Company.\n\u25e6The credit spreads applied in determining the IBRs.\n\u25e6The collateral adjustment applied in determining the IBRs.\n/s/DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 31, 2020\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1982.",

Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter.",
