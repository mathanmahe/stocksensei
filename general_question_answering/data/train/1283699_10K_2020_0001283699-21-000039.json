    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nBusiness Overview and Strategy\nUn-carrier Strategy\nWe are the Un-carrier. Through our Un-carrier strategy, we have disrupted the wireless communications services industry, by actively engaging with and listening to our customers and eliminating their existing pain points, including providing them with added value, an exceptional experience and implementing signature Un-carrier initiatives that have changed wireless for good. We ended annual service contracts, overages, unpredictable international roaming fees, data buckets and so much more. We are inspired by a relentless customer experience focus, consistently leading the wireless industry in customer care by delivering an excellent customer experience with our \u201cTeam of Experts,\u201d which drives our record-high customer satisfaction levels while enabling operational efficiencies.\nThe Un-carrier was supercharged upon the completion of our Merger with Sprint on April 1, 2020, which resulted in Sprint and its subsidiaries becoming wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of T-Mobile. Through the Merger, we acquired Sprint\u2019s customers and 2.5 GHz mid-band spectrum, among other assets. As the supercharged Un-carrier, we are on a mission to build America\u2019s best 5G network, offering customers unrivalled coverage and capacity where they live, work and play. Our network is the foundation of our success and powers everything we do. As one company, we have begun to combine our mid-band spectrum licenses, including Advanced Wireless Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), Personal Communications Services (\u201cPCS\u201d) and 2.5 GHz, our millimeter-wave licenses and our foundational layer of low-band spectrum, including 600 MHz, 700 MHz and 800 MHz, to create a \u201clayer cake\u201d of spectrum and provide an unmatched 5G experience to our customers. We believe this layer cake will broaden and deepen our nationwide 5G network enabling accelerated innovation and increased competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. We have achieved and expect to continue to achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations.\nFor more information related to the Merger, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Sprint Merger and Note 2 - Business Combination of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur 4G Long-Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) network covers 328 million people (99% of the U.S. population). Additionally, our 5G network is America\u2019s largest, covering 1.6 million square miles, 280 million people and 9,100 cities and towns across the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as of December 31, 2020.\nWe continue to expand the footprint and improve the quality of our network, providing outstanding wireless experiences for customers who will not have to compromise on quality and value. Going forward, it is this network that will allow us to deliver new, innovative products and services with the same customer experience focus and industry-disrupting mentality that has redefined the wireless communications services industry in the United States in the customers\u2019 favor.\nBusiness\nAs of December 31, 2020, we provide wireless services to 102.1 million postpaid and prepaid customers and generate revenue by providing affordable wireless communications services to these customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Our most significant expenses relate to operating and expanding our network, providing a full range of devices, acquiring and retaining high-quality customers and compensating employees. We provide service, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, through our owned and operated retail stores, as well as through our websites (www.t-mobile.com and www.metrobyt-mobile.com), T-Mobile app and customer care channels. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites. The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.\nServices and Products\nWe provide wireless communications services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets and other mobile communication devices, which are manufactured by various suppliers.\nOur primary service plan offering, which allows customers to subscribe for wireless communications services separately from the purchase of a device, is our signature Magenta plan (\u201cMagenta\u201d), which includes, among other benefits, unlimited talk, text and smartphone data on our network, 5G access at no extra cost, scam protection features and more. Customers also have the ability to choose additional features, such as HD video streaming and increased high-speed hotspot data, for an additional cost on our Magenta Plus plan. We also offer an Essentials rate plan for customers who want the basics, as well as specific rate plans to qualifying customers, including Unlimited 55+, Military, First Responder, and Business.\nOur device options for qualifying customers include:\n\u2022The option of financing all or a portion of the individual device or accessory purchase price at the time of sale over an installment period, generally of 24 months, using an Equipment Installment Plan (\u201cEIP\u201d);\n\u2022For qualifying customers who finance their initial device with an EIP, an option to enroll in our Just Upgrade My Phone (\u201cJUMP!\u00ae\u201d) program to later upgrade their device; and\n\u2022The option to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it when eligibility requirements are met.\nWe also provide products that are complementary to our wireless communications services, including device protection, Home Internet, TVision\u2122 and wireline communication services to domestic and international customers.\nIn August 2020, we unified the Sprint retail operations under the T-Mobile brand, providing Sprint customers access to all of our products, services and retail locations.\nCustomers\nWe provide wireless communications services to two primary categories of customers:\n\u2022Postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, wearables, DIGITS (a service that allows our customers to use multiple mobile numbers on any compatible smartphone or device with internet connection) or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products; and\n\u2022Prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communications services in advance. Our prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.\nWe provide Machine-to-Machine (\u201cM2M\u201d) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (\u201cMVNO\u201d) customers access to our network. This access and the customer relationship is managed by wholesale partners.\nWe generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communications services to postpaid and prepaid customers. Our ability to attract and retain postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2020, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communications services by customer category were:\n\u202272% Postpaid customers;\n\u202219% Prepaid customers; and\n\u20229% Wholesale, roaming and other services.\nSubstantially all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nNetwork Strategy\nOn April 1, 2020, we closed our Merger with Sprint, which greatly enhanced our spectrum position. Integration of the spectrum and network assets acquired in the Merger is expected to occur over the next three years.\nThe integration strategy includes deploying the acquired spectrum on the combined network assets to supplement capacity, migrating Sprint customers to our network and optimizing the combined assets by decommissioning redundant sites to realize synergies.\nSpectrum Position\nWe provide wireless communications services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as AWS, PCS and 2.5 GHz, low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz, 700 MHz and 800 MHz spectrum and mmWave spectrum.\n\u2022We controlled an average of 329 MHz of combined low- and mid-band spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2020. This spectrum is comprised of:\n\u2022An average of 40 MHz in the 600 MHz band;\n\u2022An average of 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band;\n\u2022An average of 14 MHz in the 800 MHz band;\n\u2022An average of 66 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band;\n\u2022An average of 41 MHz in the AWS band; and\n\u2022An average of 158 MHz in the 2.5 GHz band.\n\u2022In March 2020, the FCC announced the results of Auctions 103 (37/39 GHz and 47 GHz spectrum bands). We were the winning bidder of 2,384 licenses for an aggregate price of $873 million. Prior to the Merger, the FCC announced that Sprint was the winning bidder of 127 licenses in Auction 103.\n\u2022In April 2020, we acquired control of FCC licenses in the 800 MHz, 1900 MHz and 2.5 GHz bands as part of our Merger with Sprint.\n\u2022We plan to evaluate future spectrum purchases in current and upcoming auctions and in the secondary market to further augment our current spectrum position.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, we had equipment deployed on approximately 108,000 macro cell sites and 69,000 small cell/distributed antenna system sites across our T-Mobile and legacy Sprint networks.\n5G Leadership\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, our Extended Range 5G covers 280 million people in 9,100 cities and towns covering 1.6 million square miles.\n\u2022Our Ultra Capacity 5G covers 106 million people as of December 31, 2020.\nCompetition\nThe wireless communications services industry is highly competitive. We are the second largest provider of wireless communications services in the U.S. as measured by our total postpaid and prepaid customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (\u201cAT&T\u201d) and Verizon Communications, Inc. (\u201cVerizon\u201d). In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, MVNOs, including TracFone Wireless, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., Altice USA, Inc. and DISH, many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video or music streaming services, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.\nHuman Capital\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 75,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.\nAttraction and Retention\nWe employ a highly skilled workforce within a broad range of functions. Our employees are located throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, to serve our nationwide network and retail operations. Our headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington and Overland Park, Kansas.\nWe attract and retain our workforce through a dynamic and inclusive culture and by providing exceptional benefits, including:\n\u2022Competitive medical, dental and vision benefits;\n\u2022Annual stock grants to all full-time and part-time employees and a discounted Employee Stock Purchase Program;\n\u2022A 401(k) Savings Plan;\n\u2022LiveMagenta: a custom-branded program for employee engagement and well-being, including free access to life coaches, financial coaches and tools for healthy living;\n\u2022Access to personal health advocates offering independent guidance;\n\u2022Tuition assistance for all full-time and part-time employees; and\n\u2022A matching program for employee donations and volunteering.\nTo keep our employees safe during the Pandemic, we implemented remote working arrangements for many employees with a significant portion of our internal and global care employees transitioned to a work-from-home environment. We also encouraged our corporate and administrative employees to work remotely, if possible. For employees who did not have this option, we provided access to incremental paid time off for employees experiencing symptoms, taking care of children who were home due to school closures or caring for individuals impacted by the Pandemic. We also continue to encourage healthy practices such as social distancing and hand washing and have increased cleaning and sanitation in all our facilities and stores. See \u201cOur Response - To Protect and Support Our Employees and Communities\u201d included in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information on actions we took to support our employees during the Pandemic.\nTraining and Development\nWe believe in providing opportunities for our employees to improve their skills and advance their careers. We do this through a variety of programs, including:\n\u2022Award-winning career and development programs for all employees at all levels;\n\u2022Transparent career paths available to employees and candidates that provide realistic progression timelines, salaries and expectations;\n\u2022A Customer Care organization that uses 96 types of programs to train over 42,000 front line representatives and leaders;\n\u2022A Leader-to-Executives Program that provides elite career track opportunities for select MBA students and graduates; and\n\u2022Training for employees with disabilities pursuant to U.S. Department of Labor standards.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDE&I\u201d) have always been a part of the Un-carrier culture, and we are committed to having DE&I touch every aspect of our future as a bigger and better company. We are on a mission to increase diversity in leadership, talent pipelines, suppliers and customers while embedding inclusive behaviors across the business and investing in the communities we serve.\nWe have established six DE&I Employee Resource Groups and four sub-affinity groups that have helped us establish and maintain a culture of inclusion. Currently, we have over 55 DE&I chapters across the nation that help spearhead volunteer opportunities, events and meaningful conversation with employees at a local level. Our DE&I networks include the following:\n\u2022Accessibility Community at T-Mobile;\n\u2022Multicultural Alliance;\n\u25e6Asia Pacific & Allies Network;\n\u25e6Black Empowerment;\n\u25e6Indigenous Peoples Network;\n\u25e6Magenta Latinx Network;\n\u2022Multigenerational Network;\n\u2022Pride;\n\u2022Veterans & Allies Network; and\n\u2022Women & Allies Network.\nWe have established an External Diversity and Inclusion Council in connection with our civil rights memorandum of understanding. The council includes civil rights leaders representing a wide-range of underrepresented communities. Together with T-Mobile, the council will help identify ways to improve our efforts in focus areas such as corporate governance, workforce recruitment and retention, procurement, entrepreneurship, philanthropy and community investment.\nRegulation\nThe FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cCommunications Act\u201d). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly.\nExcept for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, Congress\u2019s and the FCC\u2019s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (\u201cCMRS\u201d), which includes cellular, PCS and other wireless services, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses or our competitive position in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers\u2019 spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers.\nCongress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest, but must be reviewed and approved. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT.\nFor our Educational Broadband Service (\u201cEBS\u201d) licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, FCC rules previously limited eligibility to hold EBS licenses to accredited educational institutions and certain governmental, religious and nonprofit entities, while permitting those license holders to lease up to 95% of their capacity for non-educational purposes. Therefore, we primarily access EBS spectrum through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial\nterm equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. On April 27, 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses but we continue to lease most of our spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time. The elimination of these restrictions will allow and may encourage current license holders to sell their licenses to other parties, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated.\nWhile the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Notwithstanding this federal preemption, in response to the Pandemic, several state legislatures are considering bills that could potentially set prices, minimum performance standards, and/or restrictions on service discontinuation that could impact our business in those states.\nIn addition, following the FCC\u2019s adoption of the 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom (\u201cRIF\u201d) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as Title I (non-common carrier services), a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality and privacy requirements on providers\u2019 broadband services. The FCC\u2019s RIF Order preempted such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC\u2019s federal deregulatory approach. Recently, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local net neutrality laws. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC net neutrality rules and be preempted; court challenges to some state enactments are pending.\nWhile most states are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements, while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws. If not preempted or rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress.\nIn addition, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown, and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.\nAvailable Information\nThe SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically at www.sec.gov. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are also publicly available free of charge on the investor relations section of our website at investor.t-mobile.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our corporate governance guidelines, director selection guidelines, code of ethics for senior financial officers, code of business conduct, speak up policy, supplier code of conduct, and charters for the audit, compensation, nominating and corporate governance, executive and CEO selection committees of our Board of Directors are also posted on the investor relations section of our website at investor.t-mobile.com. The information on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in\nevaluating T-Mobile. Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Wireless Industry\nThe Pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our business, liquidity, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Pandemic has impacted, and will continue to impact, the demand for our products and services, the ways in which our customers use them, where and how we work, and our suppliers and vendors\u2019 ability to provide products to us. As a result, our business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results have been, and will continue to be, adversely impacted by the Pandemic.\nTo ensure the safety of both customers and employees, we continue to open, close, and limit capacity of our retail stores in compliance with local and state mandates and orders. However, even when we are able to open stores and provide safe and healthy operating environments, we have seen and may continue to see decreased traffic and therefore lower switching activity in the industry.\nIn addition, the Pandemic has impacted customers\u2019 ability to pay, and we expect to continue to work with them to help them maintain service and become current on their accounts, which may materially and adversely impact our financial results. These efforts may divert resources from our network buildout and put additional strain on our network, potentially leading to impacts on customer experience.\nEven after the Pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience impacts to our business as a result of the Pandemic\u2019s global economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Further, as the Pandemic situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the Pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or in a manner that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nEconomic, political and market conditions, including those caused by the Pandemic, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, and other macro-economic factors.\nOur services and device financing plans are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be vulnerable to weak economic conditions, particularly our subprime customers. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plans due to an inability to pay.\nFurther, because we offer a device leasing plan, we expect to realize economic benefit from the estimated residual value of a leased device, which reflects the estimated fair value of the underlying asset at the end of the expected lease term. Changes in residual value assumptions made at lease inception affect the amount of depreciation expense and the net amount of equipment under operating leases. If estimated residual values, in the aggregate, significantly decline due to economic factors, including COVID-19 impacts, obsolescence, or other circumstances, we may not realize such residual value. Sprint historically suffered, and we may suffer, negative consequences including increased costs and increased losses on devices as a result of a lease customer default, the related termination of a lease, and the attempted repossession of the device, including failure of a lease customer to return a leased device.\nWeak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers, dealers, and MVNOs, some of which may file for bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or may be unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.\nCompetition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have multiple competitors, many of which possess either more or different access to strategic capital assets, and yet we compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network coverage, speed and quality and customer\nservice. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry\u2019s customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to ongoing competition for customers. We also expect that our customers\u2019 appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. This competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for a relatively fixed pool of customers with an ever-expanding variety of products and services. Our ability to compete will depend upon, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, and attractive pricing, all of which will involve significant expenses.\nWe face intense and increasing competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, such as cable, telecom services and content, satellite, and other service providers. Companies such as Altice, Charter and DISH are diversifying outside cable, voice and broadband services to also offer wireless services. Competitors such as Comcast and AT&T provide original content services in addition to wireless, cable, voice and broadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from Internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. These factors, together with the effects of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, such as 5G, could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nJoint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless sector have resulted in, and are expected to result in, larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. Further consolidation, including the pending acquisition of TracFone Wireless by Verizon, could negatively impact our businesses, including wholesale. We will experience declining revenues from our wholesale business if Verizon migrates legacy TracFone customers off the T-Mobile network and DISH migrates Boost customers to their standalone network. Our competitors may also enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. In addition, refusal of our competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming and/or backhaul services, on reasonable terms could negatively impact our business.\nWe could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly.\nOur business involves the receipt, storage and transmission of our customers\u2019 confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property (collectively, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d). Unauthorized access to Confidential Information may be difficult to anticipate, detect, or prevent, particularly given that the methods of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. We are subject to the threat of unauthorized access or disclosure of Confidential Information by state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third-party suppliers, or other security incidents that could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of Confidential Information.\nWe have previously notified affected customers of incidents involving unauthorized access to certain customer information in compliance with applicable laws concerning customer notice, and we expect we will provide such notices again. For example, in December 2020, we notified a small number of customers of unauthorized access to their account information that is considered \u201ccustomer proprietary network information\u201d by the FCC. More typically, such incidents involved attempts to commit fraud by taking control of a customer\u2019s phone line. In a few cases, incidents involved unauthorized access to credit card information, financial data, social security numbers or passwords. While we do not believe these security incidents were material and actions were taken to prevent reoccurrence, we expect to continue to be the target of cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents, which may in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nAs a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of cyber-attacks (e.g., denial of service and other malicious attacks). Such attacks against companies may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments.\nIn addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service providers as part of our business operations. These third-party service providers have experienced data breaches and other attacks that included unauthorized access to Confidential Information in the past, and face security challenges common to all parties that collect and\nprocess information. Past data breaches include a breach of the networks of one of our credit decisioning providers in September 2015, during which a subset of records containing current and potential customer information was acquired by an external party.\nOur procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever-evolving threat landscape. We cannot make assurances that all preventive actions taken will adequately repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third-party supplier environments. If we or our third-party suppliers are subject to such attacks or security breaches, we may incur significant costs or other material financial impacts, which may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, our cyber insurance, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or suffer damage to our reputation. Any future cyber-attacks, data breaches, or security incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a result of completing the Transactions, we acquired additional spectrum from Sprint, including 2.5 GHz spectrum, that we need in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands, and deploy new technologies. Although the Merger has reduced our immediate need to acquire additional spectrum, as we continue to enhance the quality of our services in certain geographic areas and deploy new technologies, including 5G, we may acquire additional spectrum in the future. As a result, we will continue to actively seek to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant.\nThe continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire and/or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. Our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. Additionally, the FCC may not be able to provide sufficient additional spectrum to auction or we may be unable to secure the spectrum necessary to maintain or enhance our competitive position in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all.\nThe FCC may impose conditions on the acquisition and use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas.\nIf we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture.\nThe market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented personnel for all areas of our organization, including our CEO and the other members of our senior leadership team. In addition, certain members of our senior leadership team, including our CEO have term employment agreements with us. Our inability to extend the terms of these employment agreements or to replace these members of our senior leadership team at the end of their terms with qualified and capable successors could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to U.S. immigration policy, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our Company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs.\nIn addition, uncertainty about the process of integrating T-Mobile\u2019s and Sprint\u2019s businesses could have an adverse impact on our employees. These uncertainties may impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, as existing and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us. If key employees depart, our business could be negatively impacted. We may incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and replacing departing employees and may lose\nsignificant expertise and talent. As a result, we may not be able to meet our business plan and our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy.\nSignificant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers\u2019 changing demands. Enhancing our network, including our 5G network, is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from older technologies. Adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. If our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, financial condition and operating results.\nSystem failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems, which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nTo be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. We rely upon systems and networks - those of suppliers and other providers, in addition to our own - to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers\u2019 information and our information. System, network or infrastructure failures may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or the compromise of customer information. Examples of these risks include:\n\u2022human error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;\n\u2022physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure with respect to both our wireless and wireline networks, including those as a result of severe weather and, natural disasters, public health crises, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility, and acts of war;\n\u2022theft of customer and/or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion;\n\u2022unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers;\n\u2022supplier failures or delays; and\n\u2022system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network.\nSuch events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to fines, penalties, adverse actions or judgments, litigation or governmental investigation. Remediation costs could include liability for information loss, costs of repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. Our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events.\nThe challenges in satisfying the large number of Government Commitments in the required time frames and the significant cumulative cost incurred in tracking, monitoring and complying with them could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn connection with the regulatory proceedings and approvals required to close the Transactions, we agreed to various Government Commitments. These Government Commitments include, among other things, extensive 5G network build-out commitments, obligations to deliver high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans, and marketing an in-home broadband product to households where spectrum capacity is sufficient. Other Government Commitments relate to national security, pricing and availability of rate plans, employment, substantial monetary contributions to support organizations, and implementation of diversity and inclusion initiatives. The majority of the Government Commitments specify time frames for compliance and reporting. Failure to fulfill our obligations under these Government Commitments in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions.\nWe expect to incur significant costs, expenses and fees to track, monitor, comply with and fulfill our obligations under these Government Commitments. In addition, abiding by the Government Commitments may divert our management\u2019s time and energy away from other business operations and could force us to make business decisions we would not otherwise make and forego taking actions that might be beneficial to the Company. The challenges in satisfying the large number of Government Commitments in the required time frames and the cost incurred in tracking, monitoring and complying with them could also adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results and hinder our ability to effectively compete.\nOur business may be adversely impacted if we are not able to successfully manage the ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements entered into in connection with the Divestiture Transaction and known or unknown liabilities arising in connection therewith.\nIn connection with the closing of the Divestiture Transaction, we and DISH entered into certain commercial and transition services arrangements, including a Master Network Services Agreement (the \u201cMNSA\u201d) and a Spectrum Purchase Agreement (the \u201cSpectrum Purchase Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the MNSA, DISH will receive network services from the Company for a period of seven years. As set forth in the MNSA, the Company will provide DISH, among other things, (a) legacy network services for certain Boost Mobile prepaid end users on the Sprint network, (b) T-Mobile network services for certain end users that have been migrated to the T-Mobile network or provisioned on the T-Mobile network by or on behalf of DISH and (c) infrastructure mobile network operator services to assist in the access and integration of the DISH network. Pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement, DISH has agreed to purchase all of Sprint\u2019s 800 MHz spectrum (approximately 13.5 MHz of nationwide spectrum) for a total of approximately $3.6 billion; provided, however, that if DISH breaches the Spectrum Purchase agreement prior to the closing or fails to deliver the purchase price following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions, DISH\u2019s sole liability will be to pay us a fee of approximately $72 million. In such instance, T-Mobile may be required to conduct an auction sale of all of Sprint\u2019s 800 MHz spectrum under the terms set forth in the Consent Decree, but would not be required to divest such spectrum for an amount less than $3.6 billion. The covered spectrum sale will not occur before the third anniversary of the Merger (i.e., not before April 1, 2023), but must be divested within the later of three years after the closing of the Divestiture Transaction and five days after receipt of the approval from the FCC for the transfer, following an application for FCC approval to be filed by the third anniversary of the closing of the Merger. T-Mobile may exercise an option to lease back 4 MHz (2 MHz downlink + 2 MHz uplink) of the spectrum for two years following the closing of the 800 MHz spectrum sale at the same per person rate used to calculate the purchase price paid by DISH to T-Mobile - a rate of approximately $68 million per year.\nFailure to successfully manage these ongoing commercial and transition services arrangements entered into in connection with the Divestiture Transaction and liabilities arising in connection therewith may result in material unanticipated problems, including diversion of management time and energy, significant expenses and liabilities. There may also be other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses or liabilities associated with the Divestiture Transaction, the occurrence of which could materially impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results. In addition, there may be an increase in competition from DISH and other third parties that DISH may enter into commercial agreements with, who are significantly larger and with greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. Such increased competition may result in our loss of customers and other business relationships.\nAny acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n\u2022diversion of management attention from running our existing business;\n\u2022increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business;\n\u2022difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;\n\u2022potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;\n\u2022significant transaction-related expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction;\n\u2022acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings; and\n\u2022any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.\nFor any or all of these reasons, acquisitions, investments, or mergers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business, and the failure or inability of such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend heavily on suppliers, service providers, their subcontractors and other third parties for us to efficiently operate our business. Due to the complexity of our business, it is not unusual to engage a diverse set of suppliers to help us develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services such as wireless and wireline network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. Some of our suppliers may provide services from outside of the United States, which carries additional regulatory and legal obligations. We commonly rely on suppliers to provide us with contractual assurances and to disclose accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our policies and standards, including our Supplier Code of Conduct and our third-party risk management practices. The failure of our suppliers to comply with our expectations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMany of the products and services we use are available through multiple sources and suppliers. However, there are a limited number of suppliers who can support or provide billing services, voice and data communications transport services, wireless or wireline network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. Disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur suppliers, service providers and their subcontractors may not perform at the levels we expect or at the levels required by their contracts. Our suppliers are also subject to their own risks, including, but not limited to, economic, financial and credit conditions and the risks of natural catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and public health crises such as the Pandemic. Our business could be severely disrupted if critical suppliers or service providers fail to comply with their contracts or if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur financial condition and operating results will be negatively affected if we experience high fraud rates or volumes related to device financing, customer payment cards, third-party dealers, employees, subscriptions, identities or account takeover fraud.\nOur operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including any fraud related to device financing, customer payment cards, third-party dealers, employees, subscriptions, service use/abuse, or account takeover fraud. If our fraud strategies and processes are not successful in detecting, mitigating, and preventing fraud, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operation results. This includes fraudulent activities perpetrated directly against us or through the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs.\nWe have, and we expect that we will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business, economic, market and\nindustry conditions and increasing the amount of cash required to service our debt. In addition, this level of indebtedness may reduce funds available to support efforts to integrate T-Mobile\u2019s and Sprint\u2019s businesses and realize the expected benefits of the Transactions, and may also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and other activities. Those impacts may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, which could increase the risks associated with our capital structure.\nBecause of our substantial indebtedness, there is a risk that we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms.\nOur ability to service our substantial debt obligations will depend on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market and industry conditions and other factors, including our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the Transactions. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations when due. If we are unable to meet such obligations or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing such debt obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or make additional borrowings. We may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt, sell assets or make additional borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nSome or all of our variable-rate indebtedness may use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR will be discontinued after 2021 and will be replaced with an alternative reference rate. The consequence of this development cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. In addition, any hedging agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations may not offer complete protection from these risks or may be unsuccessful, and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt, and any portion not subject to such hedging agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases or foreign currency fluctuations, as applicable. If any financial institutions that are parties to our hedging agreements were to default on their payment obligations to us, declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we would be unhedged against the underlying exposures. Any posting of collateral by us under our hedging agreements and the modification or termination of any of our hedging agreements could negatively impact our liquidity or other financial metrics. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness and other financings include restrictive covenants that limit our operating\nflexibility.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness and other financings impose material operating and financial restrictions. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and maintenance and incurrence-based financial tests, together with our debt service obligations, may limit our ability to engage in transactions and pursue strategic business opportunities, including the following:\n\u2022incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;\n\u2022paying dividends, redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022selling, buying or leasing assets, properties or licenses, including spectrum;\n\u2022developing assets, properties or licenses that we have or in the future may procure;\n\u2022creating liens on assets securing indebtedness or other obligations;\n\u2022participating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;\n\u2022engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations or other transactions;\n\u2022entering into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022our subsidiaries paying dividends or making other payments to us.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain debt financing, make share repurchases, refinance or pay principal on our outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to business, economic, market and industry conditions and other changes in our operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate the commitments they had made or the right to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding plus any interest, fees, penalties or premiums. An event of default may also compel us to sell certain assets securing indebtedness under these agreements.\nCredit rating downgrades could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results, which rely on investment-grade markets.\nCredit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, as a result, cost of capital. Our current ratings reflect each rating agency\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. Our capital structure and business model are reliant on continued access to the investment-grade debt markets. Each rating agency reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade in our corporate rating and/or our issued investment-grade debt ratings, or our amount of secured debt outstanding, could impact our ability to access the investment-grade debt market and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nAny material weaknesses we identify while we work to integrate and align policies, principles and practices of the two companies following the Merger, or any other failure by us to maintain effective internal controls, could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements. Additionally, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital could be negatively impacted, and we could be subject to significant costs and reputational damage that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we, along with our independent registered public accounting firm, are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This requirement is subject to an exemption for business combinations during the most recent fiscal year, which we are utilizing due to the Merger. Any identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting would still be reported, as obligated.\nWhile we integrate and align the policies, principles and practices of the two companies following the Merger, as a result of the differences in control environments and cultures, we could identify material weaknesses that could result in materially inaccurate financial statements, materially inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent error or fraud for the combined company. There can be no assurance that remediation of any material weaknesses identified during integration of the two companies will be completed in a timely manner or that the remedial measures will prevent other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. If we are unable to remediate material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, then our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and otherwise to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will be negatively impacted. The impact could negatively impact our business, financial condition or operating results, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require the expenditure of significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties, investigations or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nChanges in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to, roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. We are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including device financing and insurance activities.\nThe FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation\non licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. Additionally, the FTC and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services.\nWe cannot assure that the FCC or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations, implement new programs in response to the Pandemic, or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. For example, in response to the Pandemic, T-Mobile implemented the Keep Americans Connected Pledge in March 2020, in which we pledged, through June 2020, to not terminate service for certain customers failing to pay their bills due to the Pandemic, to waive any such customers\u2019 late fees, and to open our Wi-Fi hotspots to any American who needs them. Similarly, in response to the Pandemic, starting in January 2021 and extending at least 90 days, the California Public Utilities Commission adopted a resolution providing a moratorium on customer disconnects and late fees for certain California customers facing financial hardship. Additionally, under the Obama administration, the FCC established net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules were largely rolled back under the Trump administration, the FCC could possibly revisit that decision under the Biden administration. In addition, some states and other jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws in these areas (including, for example, the CCPA and CPRA as discussed below), and it is uncertain what rules may be promulgated under the Biden administration, perpetuating the risk and uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment and compliance around these issues.\nIn addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communications services providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. We also cannot assure that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with FCC or other governmental regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of privacy and data protection may result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.\nIn January 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) became effective, creating new data privacy rights for California residents and new compliance obligations for us. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, and we could see increased litigation costs. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), was passed by Californians via ballot initiative during the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with a lookback to January 1, 2022), will significantly modify the CCPA and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies such as ours doing business in California. Other states (such as Nevada) have passed or are considering similar legislation (such as Washington), which could create more risks and potential costs for us, especially to the extent the specific requirements vary from those in California, Nevada and other existing laws.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation costs to ensure compliance with the CCPA, the CPRA, and their related regulations and any additional laws and regulations could cause us to incur further costs or further constrain our business, strategies, offerings and initiatives.\nUnfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe and our affiliates are involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, investigations and proceedings and litigation matters. Such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel.\nIn connection with the Transactions, it is possible that stockholders of T-Mobile and/or Sprint may file putative class action lawsuits or shareholder derivative actions against the Company and the legacy T-Mobile board of directors and/or the legacy Sprint board of directors. Among other remedies, these stockholders could seek damages. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and any such potential lawsuits could result in substantial costs and may be costly and distracting to management.\nAdditionally, on April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint. Those matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions and other proceedings, including, among other things, certain ongoing FCC and state government agency investigations into Sprint\u2019s Lifeline program. In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving customers even though those customers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint\u2019s usage policy for the Lifeline program due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying customer usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated. Sprint has made a number of payments to reimburse the federal government and certain states for excess subsidy payments. Unfavorable resolution of these matters could require making additional reimbursements and paying additional fines and penalties.\nOn February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating Section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. We recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount as of March 31, 2020, which was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe, along with equipment manufacturers and other carriers, are subject to current and potential future lawsuits alleging adverse health effects arising from the use of wireless handsets or from wireless transmission equipment such as cell towers. In addition, the FCC has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless device emissions, and its assessment of the risks associated with using wireless devices may evolve based on its findings. Any of these allegations or changes in risk assessments could result in customers purchasing fewer devices and wireless services, could result in significant legal and regulatory liability, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. In addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe offer regulated financial services products. These products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations.\nThe financing of devices, such as through our EIP, JUMP! On Demand or other leasing programs, such as those acquired in the Merger, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. Failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations may increase our risk exposure in the following areas:\n\u2022consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC; and\n\u2022regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business may be impacted by new or amended tax laws or regulations or administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws or regulations.\nIn connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, fees and regulatory charges (\u201ctax\u201d or \u201ctaxes\u201d) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal and state USF contributions and common carrier regulatory charges and public safety fees. In addition, we incur and pay state and local transaction taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws (such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 or the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) may be uncertain and subject to different interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services and in the context of our recent merger with Sprint. Legislative changes, administrative interpretations and judicial decisions affecting the scope or application of tax laws could also impact revenue reported and taxes due on tax inclusive plans.\nIn the event that T-Mobile, including pre-acquisition Sprint, has incorrectly described, disclosed, determined, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes and regulatory or public safety charges on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes or charges, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws.\nOur existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the period for which they are granted. Our licenses have been granted with an expectation of renewal and the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. If we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nEach of DT, which controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock, and SoftBank, a significant stockholder of T-Mobile, may have interests that differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nUpon the completion of the Transactions, DT and SoftBank entered into the SoftBank Proxy Agreement, and on June 22, 2020, DT, Claure Mobile LLC (\u201cCM LLC\u201d), and Marcelo Claure entered into a Proxy, Lock-up and ROFR Agreement (\u201cthe Claure Proxy Agreement,\u201d together with the SoftBank Proxy Agreement, the \u201cProxy Agreements\u201d). Pursuant to the Proxy Agreements, at any meeting of our stockholders, the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by SoftBank or CM LLC will be voted in the manner as directed by DT.\nAccordingly, DT controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock and therefore we are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d as defined in The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) listing rules, and we are not subject to NASDAQ requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.\nIn addition, pursuant to our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, as long as DT beneficially owns 30% or more of our outstanding common stock, we are restricted from taking certain actions without DT\u2019s prior written consent, including (i) incurring indebtedness above certain levels based on a specified debt to cash flow ratio, (ii) taking any action that would cause a default under any instrument evidencing indebtedness involving DT or its affiliates, (iii) acquiring or disposing of assets or entering into mergers or similar acquisitions in excess of $1.0 billion, (iv) changing the size of our board of directors, (v) subject to certain exceptions, issuing equity of 10% or more of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock, or issuing equity to redeem debt held by DT, (vi) repurchasing or redeeming equity securities or making any extraordinary or in-kind dividend other than on a pro rata basis, or (vii) making certain changes involving our CEO. We are also restricted from amending our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws in any manner that could adversely affect DT\u2019s rights under the Second Amended and\nRestated Stockholders\u2019 Agreement for as long as DT beneficially owns 5% or more of our outstanding common stock. These restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our board of directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nDT effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our Certificate of Incorporation, a sale or merger of our Company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law. DT\u2019s controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the Company. DT and SoftBank, as significant stockholders, may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counterparty in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.\nIn addition, we license certain trademarks from DT, including the right to use the trademark \u201cT-Mobile\u201d as a name for the Company and our flagship brand, under a trademark license agreement, as amended, with DT. As described in more detail in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 21, 2020 under the heading \u201cTransactions with Related Persons and Approval,\u201d we are obligated to pay DT a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25% (the \u201croyalty rate\u201d) of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services sold by the Company under the licensed trademarks subject to a cap of $80.0 million per calendar year through December 31, 2028. We and DT are obligated to negotiate a new trademark license when (i) DT has 50% or less of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or (ii) any third party owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or otherwise has the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company. If we and DT fail to agree on a new trademark license, either we or DT may terminate the trademark license and such termination shall be effective, in the case of clause (i) above, on the third anniversary after notice of termination and, in the case of clause (ii) above, on the second anniversary after notice of termination. A further increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFuture sales of our common stock by DT and SoftBank and foreign ownership limitations by the FCC could have a negative impact on our stock price and decrease the value of our stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe, DT and SoftBank are parties to the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders\u2019 Agreement pursuant to which DT and SoftBank are free to transfer their shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in a third party owning more than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transfer is approved by our board of directors or the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. The Second Amended and Restated Stockholders\u2019 Agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by DT or SoftBank. Moreover, we may be required to file a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities of ours held by DT and SoftBank, which would facilitate the resale by DT or SoftBank of all or any portion of such shares of our common stock or debt securities they hold. The sale of shares of our common stock by DT or SoftBank (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. In addition, even if DT or SoftBank does not sell a large number of their shares into the market, their right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price.\nFurthermore, under existing law, no more than 20% of an FCC licensee\u2019s capital stock may be directly owned, or no more than 25% indirectly owned, or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. If an FCC licensee is controlled by another entity, up to 25% of that entity\u2019s capital stock may be owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. Foreign ownership above the 25% holding company level may be allowed if the FCC finds such higher levels consistent with the public interest. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest with respect to investors from certain nations. If our foreign ownership by previously unapproved foreign parties were to exceed the permitted level, the FCC could subject us to a range of penalties, including an order for us to divest the foreign ownership in part, fines, license revocation or denials of license renewals. If ownership of our common stock by an unapproved foreign entity were to become subject to such limitations, or if any\nownership of our common stock violates any other rule or regulation of the FCC applicable to us, our Certificate of Incorporation provides for certain redemption provisions at a pre-determined price which may be less than fair market value. These limitations and our Certificate of Incorporation may limit our ability to attract additional equity financing outside the United States and decrease the value of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:\n\u2022adverse economic, political or market conditions in the U.S. and international markets, including those caused by the Pandemic;\n\u2022our or our competitors\u2019 actual or anticipated operating and financial results;\n\u2022introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors;\n\u2022analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022realization of the expected benefits and synergies of the Transactions, or market or analyst expectations with respect thereto;\n\u2022transactions in our common stock by major investors;\n\u2022share repurchases by us or purchases by DT or SoftBank;\n\u2022the potential issuance to SoftBank of the SoftBank Specified Shares Amount, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Letter Agreement (see Note 2 - Business Combination of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information);\n\u2022DT\u2019s financial performance and results of operations, or actions implied or taken by DT or SoftBank;\n\u2022entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war;\n\u2022our performance, including customer growth, and our financial and operational performance;\n\u2022market perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets, and deployment of our LTE and 5G platforms and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications, or content;\n\u2022market perceptions of the wireless communications services industry and valuation models for us and the industry;\n\u2022conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry sectors in which we operate;\n\u2022changes in our credit rating or future prospects;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\n\u2022the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;\n\u2022actual or anticipated consolidation or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors, or other participants in related or adjacent industries, or market speculation regarding such activities;\n\u2022disruptions of our operations or the operations of service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations; and\n\u2022availability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum, and the extent to which we or our competitors succeed in acquiring additional spectrum.\nIn addition, the stock market has been volatile and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past, which may continue for the foreseeable future. Severe market fluctuations, such as those experienced recently with regard to the Pandemic, oil and other commodity prices, concerns over sovereign debt risk, trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, and those that may arise from global and political tensions or weak economic conditions, have had and may continue to have a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. These changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and for general corporate purposes, including the integration of T-Mobile\u2019s and Sprint\u2019s businesses and the continued build-out of our 5G network. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of potential gain.\nRisks Related to Integration\nAlthough we expect that the Transactions will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized in the amounts anticipated, or may not be realized within the expected time frame, and risks associated with the foregoing may also result from the extended delay in the integration of the companies.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate our and Sprint\u2019s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected cost savings. In addition, some of the anticipated synergies are not expected to occur for a significant time period following the completion of the Transactions and will require substantial capital expenditures in the near term.\nAs a result of the delays experienced in the completion of the Transactions and the Pandemic, our anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Transactions may be reduced or eliminated, including a delay in the integration of, or inability to integrate, the networks of T-Mobile and Sprint. Even if we are able to integrate the two companies successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including the expected synergies and network benefits, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe have incurred substantial expenses as a result of completing the Transactions. We expect to incur substantial additional expenses in connection with integrating T-Mobile\u2019s and Sprint\u2019s businesses, operations, policies and procedures and compliance with the Government Commitments. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and offset the expected synergies.\nOur business and Sprint\u2019s business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers or vendors, may be greater than expected.\nThe combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming, and may divert significant management attention and resources. This process may disrupt our business or otherwise impact our ability to compete. The overall combination of our and Sprint\u2019s businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and impacts, and loss of customers and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022diversion of management attention to integration matters;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure, and supplier and vendor arrangements;\n\u2022challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies;\n\u2022alignment of key performance measurements may result in a greater need to communicate and manage clear expectations while we work to integrate and align policies and practices;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating employees;\n\u2022the transition of management to the combined company management team, and the need to address possible differences in corporate cultures, management philosophies, and compensation structures;\n\u2022challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022possible delays, disputes, or regulatory issues in connection with the finalizing and consummation of an asset purchase agreement between Sprint PCS and Shentel for all of Shentel\u2019s wireless assets and customers, and any associated adverse effects on the operations and business in the Shentel service area;\n\u2022compliance with Government Commitments relating to national security;\n\u2022known or potential unknown liabilities of Sprint that are larger than expected;\n\u2022other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses or liabilities associated with the Transactions.\nAdditionally, uncertainties over the integration process could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, dealers, retailers and others to seek to change or cancel our existing business relationships or to refuse to renew existing relationships. Suppliers, distributors and content and application providers may also delay or cease developing new products for us that are necessary for the operations of our business due to uncertainties. Competitors may also target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties.\nSome of these factors are outside our control, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, even if the integration is successful, the full benefits of the Transactions including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities may not be realized. As a result, it cannot be assured that we will realize the full benefits expected from the Transactions within the anticipated time frames or at all.\nIn connection with the Merger, we are evaluating the long-term billing system architecture strategy for our customers. Our long-term strategy is to migrate Sprint\u2019s legacy customers onto T-Mobile\u2019s existing billing platforms. We will operate and maintain multiple billing systems until such migration is completed. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business.\nFollowing the closing of the Merger, we are operating and maintaining multiple billing systems. We expect to continue to do so until successful migration of Sprint\u2019s legacy customers to T-Mobile\u2019s existing billing platforms. We may encounter unanticipated difficulties or experience delays in the ongoing integration efforts with respect to billing, causing major system or business disruptions. In addition, we or our supporting vendors may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of these billing systems could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers or negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, and/or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage.",

The data below should be read together with Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nSelected Financial Data\n(1)On April 1, 2020, we completed the Merger with Sprint. Our financial results include the consolidated operations of T-Mobile and Sprint subsequent to the date of Merger close.\n(2)On January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d and all the related amendments (collectively, the \u201cnew lease standard\u201d), using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the standards in effect for those periods.\n(3)On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d and all the related amendments (collectively, the \u201cnew revenue standard\u201d), using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the standards in effect for those periods.\n(4)In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d) was signed into legislation. The TCJA included numerous changes to existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The rate reduction took place on January 1, 2018. We recognized a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion associated with the enactment of the TCJA in Income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n(5)On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-15, \u201cStatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\u201d (the \u201cnew cash flow standard\u201d) which impacted the presentation of our cash flows related to our beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from Operating activities to Investing activities of approximately $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The new cash flow standard also impacted the presentation of our cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from Operating activities to Financing activities of $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. There were no cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs during the year ended December 31, 2016. We have applied the new cash flow standard retrospectively to all periods presented.\n(6)In connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the Merger, on July 1, 2020, DISH acquired the prepaid wireless business operated under the Boost Mobile and Sprint prepaid brands (excluding the Assurance brand Lifeline customers and the prepaid wireless customers of Shentel and Swiftel Communications, Inc.), the results of which prior to the divestiture are presented in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax.",
    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe objectives of our Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:\n\u2022A narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;\n\u2022Context to the financial statements; and\n\u2022Information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.\nOur MD&A is performed on a consolidated basis and is inclusive of the results and operations of Sprint prospectively from the close of our Merger on April 1, 2020. The Merger enhanced our spectrum portfolio, increased our customer base, altered our product mix by increasing the portion of customers who finance their devices with leasing programs and created opportunity for synergies in our operations. We anticipate an initial increase in our combined operating costs which we expect to decrease as we realize synergies. We expect the trends and results of operations of the combined company to be materially different than those of the standalone entities.\nOur MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our MD&A are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBeginning with the second quarter of 2020, we have discontinued the use of \u201cBranded\u201d to describe the results and metrics associated with our flagship brands including T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.\nSprint Merger\nTransaction Overview\nOn April 1, 2020, we completed our Merger with Sprint, a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services. As a result, Sprint and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of T-Mobile.\nThe Merger has altered the size and scope of our operations, impacting our assets, liabilities, obligations, capital requirements and performance measures. We expect the trends and results of operations of the combined company to be materially different than those of the standalone entities. As a combined company, we expect to be able to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations.\nFor more information regarding the Merger, see Note 2 - Business Combination of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn June 22, 2020, we entered into a Master Framework Agreement and related transactions with SoftBank to facilitate the SoftBank Monetization as described in Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBrand and Retail Unification\nOn August 2, 2020, we combined the Sprint and T-Mobile operations under the T-Mobile brand nationwide. We combined our retail operations and rebranded thousands of Sprint stores to T-Mobile stores while implementing the tools and systems across our distribution footprint to serve all customers in all stores.\nSale of Boost Mobile and Sprint Prepaid Brands\nIn connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the Merger, on July 1, 2020, DISH acquired the prepaid wireless business operated under the Boost Mobile and Sprint prepaid brands (excluding the Assurance brand Lifeline customers and the prepaid wireless customers of Shentel and Swiftel Communications, Inc.), including customer accounts, inventory, contracts, intellectual property and certain other specified assets (the \u201cPrepaid Business\u201d), and assumed certain related liabilities (the \u201cPrepaid Transaction\u201d). For more information, see Note 12 - Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUpon the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, we entered into a Master Network Services Agreement (the \u201cMVNO Agreement\u201d) providing for the provisioning of network services to customers of the Prepaid Business for a period of up to seven years following the closing of the Prepaid Transaction. The revenue generated through this agreement is presented within Wholesale revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income following the close of the Prepaid Transaction on July 1, 2020.\nWe included the pre-tax results of our discontinued operations in our determination of Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP measure, to reflect contributions of the Prepaid Business that was replaced by the MVNO Agreement beginning on July 1, 2020. See \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d in the \u201cPerformance Measures\u201d section of this MD&A.\nMerger-Related Costs\nMerger-related costs generally include:\n\u2022Integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations;\n\u2022Restructuring costs, including severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning; and\n\u2022Transaction costs, including legal and professional services related to the completion of the Merger.\nTransaction and restructuring costs are disclosed in Note 2 - Business Combination and Note 19 - Restructuring Costs, respectively. Merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. See \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d in the \u201cPerformance Measures\u201d section of this MD&A. Cash payments for Merger-related costs, including payments related to our restructuring plan, are included in Net cash provided by operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nMerger-related costs during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below:\nNM - Not Meaningful\nMerger-related costs will be impacted by restructuring and integration activities expected to occur over the next three years as we implement initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Merger. Transaction costs, including legal and professional service fees related to the completion of the Merger, are expected to decrease in periods subsequent to the close of the Merger.\nRestructuring\nUpon the close of the Merger, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the Merger. The major activities associated with the restructuring initiatives to date include:\n\u2022Contract termination costs associated with rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services and other agreements;\n\u2022Severance costs associated with the reduction of redundant processes and functions; and\n\u2022The decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems to achieve synergies in network costs.\nAnticipated Impacts\nOur restructuring activities are expected to occur over the next three years with substantially all costs incurred by the end of fiscal year 2023. We are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives which are dependent on consultations and negotiation with certain counterparties and the expected impact on our business operations, which could affect the amount or timing of the restructuring costs and related payments. We expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and anticipated payments associated with the restructuring initiatives.\nAs a result of our ongoing restructuring activities, we expect to realize cost efficiencies by eliminating redundancies within our combined network as well as other business processes and operations. We expect these activities to result in a reduction of expenses within Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies, and financial markets worldwide, and has caused significant volatility in the U.S. and international debt and equity markets. The impact of the Pandemic has been wide-ranging, including, but not limited to, the temporary closures of many businesses and schools, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, travel restrictions, social distancing guidelines and other governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the Pandemic. These restrictions have impacted, and will continue to impact, our business, including the demand for our products and services and the ways in which our customers purchase and use them. In addition, the Pandemic has resulted in economic uncertainty and a significant increase in unemployment in the United States, which could affect our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and ability to make timely payments. Throughout the year, the Pandemic has peaked, subsided and seen a resurgence, leading to phased re-openings, as well as continuing or renewed containment measures.\nAs a critical communications infrastructure provider as designated by the government, our focus has been on providing crucial connectivity to our customers and impacted communities while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees.\nOur Response\nWe have taken a variety of steps to help mitigate the impact of the Pandemic on our customers and to protect the health and well-being of our workforce and communities:\nTo Protect and Support Our Employees and Communities\n\u2022Before the Merger, in mid-March, approximately 80% of T-Mobile and 70% of Sprint company-owned store locations, as well as many third-party retailer locations that sell our T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile and Sprint brands were temporarily closed. In compliance with the regulations of various states, we have since reopened substantially all of our previously closed stores.\n\u2022At the onset of the Pandemic, we supplemented pay for certain of our employees and commissions for third-party dealers and provided access to incremental paid time off for employees experiencing symptoms, taking care of children who were home due to school closures or caring for individuals impacted by the Pandemic.\n\u2022We implemented remote working arrangements for many employees with a significant portion of our internal and global care employees transitioned to a work-from-home environment. We also encouraged our corporate and administrative employees to work remotely, if possible.\n\u2022We also continue to encourage healthy practices such as social distancing and hand washing and have increased cleaning and sanitation in all our facilities and stores.\nTo Keep Our Customers Connected\n\u2022In March, we committed to the FCC\u2019s Keep Americans Connected pledge, and at the FCC\u2019s request, later extended our commitment to June 30, 2020. During this period, we pledged to:\n\u2022Not terminate service to any residential or small business customers because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused by the Pandemic; and\n\u2022Waive any late fees that any residential or small business customers incurred because of their economic circumstances related to the Pandemic.\n\u2022After the Pledge extension ended, we continued to work with our customers to help them maintain service and become current on their accounts, while avoiding financial hardship.\n\u2022We also took additional temporary steps in March to ensure that all current T-Mobile customers with smartphone data plans were provided connectivity to learn and work remotely through June 30, 2020, including:\n\u2022Providing unlimited high-speed smartphone data to current customers as of March 13, 2020 who had legacy plans without unlimited high-speed data (excluding roaming);\n\u2022Giving T-Mobile postpaid and Metro by T-Mobile customers on smartphone plans with mobile hotspot data the ability to add 10GB of Smartphone Mobile HotSpot each month (20GB total);\n\u2022Working with our Lifeline partners to provide customers up to 5GB per month of free data;\n\u2022Increasing the data allowance, at no extra charge, to schools and students using our EmpowerED digital learning program to ensure each participant had access to at least 20GB of data per month; and\n\u2022Providing free international calling to landlines (and, in many cases, mobile numbers) to countries that were significantly impacted by the Pandemic through May 13, 2020.\n\u2022In addition:\n\u2022We are offering our customers creative, new COVID-safe solutions such as virtual selling and curbside pickup;\n\u2022We partnered with multiple spectrum holders and the FCC to successfully deploy additional 600 MHz spectrum on a temporary basis (through June 30, 2020), effectively doubling total 600 MHz LTE capacity across the nation to help ensure customers can stay connected during this critical time; and\n\u2022We are working to keep our network fully operational as an essential service to first responders, 911 communications and our customers and continue to expand our 5G network, while adhering to governmental guidelines.\nWe continue to monitor the Pandemic and its impacts and may adjust our actions as needed to continue to provide our products and services to our communities and employees.\nImpact on Results of Operations and Performance Measures for the Year Ended December 31, 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $458 million, before taxes, in supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs, which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. These costs have been excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as they represent direct, incremental costs as a result of our response to the Pandemic. See \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d in the \u201cPerformance Measures\u201d section of this MD&A.\nExpected Continued Impact on Results of Operations and Performance Measures\nWe continue to monitor developments regarding the Pandemic and evaluate the appropriate steps needed to align with guidelines from state, local and federal government agencies and do what is best for our employees and customers. The extent to which the Pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous future developments that we are not able to predict at this time, including the duration and scope of the Pandemic, the success of governmental, business\nand individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the Pandemic, and the impact on economic activity from the Pandemic and actions taken in response. Such impacts may include:\n\u2022Lower net customer additions due to lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures and reduced consumer spending caused by widespread unemployment and other adverse economic effects, partially offset by lower churn;\n\u2022Lower Equipment revenues and lower Cost of equipment sales from lower device sales due to lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures, which may impact our ability to sell devices;\n\u2022Higher bad debt expense on our service and EIP receivable portfolios due to adverse macro-economic conditions. Should these adverse conditions worsen, our operating and financial results could be negatively impacted;\n\u2022Continued costs to protect and support our employees and customers; and\n\u2022Potential disruptions in our supply chains.\nIn addition, we have reevaluated, and continue to assess, our spending, including for marketing purposes like advertising, capital projects like build-out of our stores, travel, third-party services and certain operating expenses. We have taken actions to adjust our spending given the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of any recessionary impacts arising from the Pandemic.\nFor additional risks to our business and industry, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nResults of Operations\nSet forth below is a summary of our consolidated financial results:\nNM - Not Meaningful\nThe following discussion and analysis is for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 unless otherwise stated.

The components of this change are discussed below.\nCost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $5.3 billion, or 79%, primarily from:\n\u2022An increase in expenses associated with leases, backhaul agreements and other network expenses, such as roaming,\nacquired in the Merger and the continued build-out of our nationwide 5G network;\n\u2022An increase of $646 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, in Merger-related costs including incremental costs associated with accelerating amortization of right-of-use assets for terminated cell sites leases and the decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems;\n\u2022Higher employee-related and benefit-related costs primarily due to increased headcount as a result of the Merger;\n\u2022An increase in repair and maintenance costs, primarily due to the Merger; and\n\u2022An increase in regulatory and roaming costs primarily due to the Merger.\nCost of equipment sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $4.5 billion, or 38%, primarily from:\n\u2022An increase of $2.8 billion in device cost of equipment sales, excluding purchased leased devices, primarily from:\n\u2022An increase in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased leased devices, due to an increase in our customer base primarily due to the Merger; and\n\u2022Higher average costs per device sold, excluding purchased leased devices, due to an increase in the high-end device mix due to the Merger;\n\u2022An increase of $759 million in leased device cost of equipment sales, primarily due to an increase in purchased leased devices as a result of the Merger; and\n\u2022An increase of $511 million in costs related to the liquidation of a higher volume of returned devices primarily as a result of the Merger.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.8 billion, or 34%, primarily from:\n\u2022Higher employee-related costs due to an increase in the number of employees primarily from the Merger;\n\u2022Higher external labor and professional services, lease and advertising expense from the Merger;\n\u2022$1.3 billion of Merger-related costs, including transaction costs associated with legal and professional services and restructuring costs including severance and store rationalization, compared to $620 million of Merger-related costs in the year ended December 31, 2019;\n\u2022Higher commission expense, primarily due to:\n\u2022Higher gross customer additions primarily due to the increased size of the company as a result of the Merger, partially offset by lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the Pandemic; partially offset by\n\u2022Lower commissions expense due to lower prepaid gross additions and compensation structure changes;\n\u2022Higher bad debt expense, primarily due to customers acquired as a result of the Merger and the recording of estimated losses associated with the new credit loss standard, including incremental bad debt for the estimated macro-economic impacts of the Pandemic; and\n\u2022Higher legal-related expenses from recording an estimated accrual associated with the FCC Notice of Apparent Liability and commitments associated with the Merger.\n\u2022Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $458 million of supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs.\nImpairment expense was $418 million and consisted of the following:\n\u2022A $218 million impairment on the goodwill in the Layer3 reporting unit; and\n\u2022A $200 million impairment on the capitalized software development costs related to our postpaid billing system.\n\u2022There was no impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor more information regarding the impairments above, see Note 5 - Property and Equipment and Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $7.5 billion, or 114%, primarily as a result of the Merger, including:\n\u2022Higher depreciation expense from assets acquired in the Merger, excluding leased devices, and network expansion from the continued build-out of our nationwide 5G network;\n\u2022Higher depreciation expense on leased devices resulting from a higher total number of customer devices under lease, primarily from customers acquired in the Merger; and\n\u2022Higher amortization from intangible assets acquired in the Merger.\nOperating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $914 million, or 16%.\nInterest expense increased $1.8 billion, or 242%, primarily from:\n\u2022The assumption of debt with a fair value of $31.8 billion in connection with the Merger;\n\u2022The issuance of an aggregate of $19.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes and the entry into a $4.0 billion secured term loan in April 2020 in connection with the Merger;\n\u2022Amortization of interest rate swap derivatives beginning upon settlement in April 2020; and\n\u2022The issuance of an aggregate of $8.75 billion in Senior Secured Notes in October 2020.\nInterest expense to affiliates decreased $161 million, or 39%, primarily from the redemption of an aggregate of $5.25 billion in Senior Notes to affiliates and the repayment of an aggregate of $4.0 billion in Incremental term loan facility to affiliates in 2020, partially offset by lower capitalized interest.\nOther expense, net increased $397 million, primarily from losses on the extinguishment of debt.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes, the components of which are discussed above, was $3.5 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIncome tax expense decreased $349 million, or 31%, primarily from:\n\u2022Lower income before income taxes; and\n\u2022A lower effective tax rate, primarily due to changes in state income taxes and excess tax benefits, partially offset by an increase in non-deductible expenses, including certain Merger-related costs. The effective tax rate was 22.3% and 24.7% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIncome from continuing operations decreased $724 million, or 21%, primarily from:\n\u2022Higher Interest expense; and\n\u2022Higher Other expense, net; partially offset by\n\u2022Higher operating income; and\n\u2022Lower Income tax expense.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax was $320 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and consists of the results of the Prepaid Business that was divested on July 1, 2020. There were no discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information regarding the Prepaid Transaction, see Note 12 - Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet income, the components of which are discussed above, decreased $404 million, or 12%, and included the following:\n\u2022Merger-related costs, net of tax, of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $501 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022The negative impact of supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs, net of tax, of $339 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to no impact for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Impairment expense of $366 million, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to no impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nOn March 2, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities, as well for affiliates whose securities collateralize a registrant\u2019s securities. We early adopted the requirements of the amendments on January 1, 2020, which included replacing guarantor condensed consolidating financial information with summarized financial information for the consolidated obligor group (Parent, Issuer, and Guarantor Subsidiaries) and no longer requiring guarantor cash flow information, financial information for non-guarantor subsidiaries, or a reconciliation to the consolidated results.\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed certain registered debt to third parties issued by Sprint, Sprint Communications, Inc. and Sprint Capital Corporation (collectively, the \u201cSprint Issuers\u201d). Amounts previously disclosed for the estimated values of certain acquired assets and liabilities assumed have been adjusted based on additional information arising subsequent to the initial valuation. These revisions to the estimated values did not have a significant impact on our summarized financial information for the consolidated obligor group.\nPursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. and the Sprint Issuers (collectively, the \u201cIssuers\u201d) is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile (\u201cParent\u201d) and certain of Parent\u2019s 100% owned subsidiaries (\u201cGuarantor Subsidiaries\u201d).\nThe guarantees of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. The indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the Issuers or borrowers to loan funds or make payments to Parent. However, the Issuers or borrowers and Guarantor Subsidiaries are allowed to make certain permitted payments to Parent under the terms of the indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d The standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. We early adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and have applied the standard retrospectively to all periods presented. Upon the adoption of the standard, deferred tax assets of non-guarantor entities in aggregate of $163 million were reclassified and netted with the deferred tax liabilities of the guarantor obligor group of the debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn March 2020, certain Guarantor Subsidiaries became non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation.\nIn connection with the preparation of our guarantor financial information for the year ended December 31, 2020, we determined that the summarized balance sheet information and summarized results of operations for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc., as presented in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020, should be adjusted to exclude investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries and the related equity method income from non-guarantor subsidiaries as of and for the year-to-date periods ending December 31, 2019, March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020. We also determined the summarized balance sheet information\nand summarized results of operations for the consolidated obligor groups of debt issued by Sprint, Sprint Communications, Inc. and Sprint Capital Corporation, as presented in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020, should be adjusted as well to exclude investments in their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries for the year-to-date periods ending June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020. Therefore, we have updated the historical summarized financial information for these periods and obligor groups as set forth below. This adjustment does not impact the Consolidated Financial Statements for any quarterly or annual periods and does not impact guarantor financial information filed prior to our adoption of the new disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities on January 1, 2020.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe following tables include summarized financial information of the obligor groups of debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc., Sprint, Sprint Communications, Inc., and Sprint Capital Corporation. The summarized financial information of each obligor group is presented on a combined basis with balances and transactions within the obligor group eliminated. Investments in and the equity in earnings of non-guarantor subsidiaries which would otherwise be consolidated in accordance with U.S. GAAP are excluded from the below summarized financial information pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X Rule 13-01.\nThe summarized balance sheet information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. is presented in the table below:\nThe summarized results of operations information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by T-Mobile USA, Inc. is presented in the table below:\nThe summarized balance sheet information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Sprint and Sprint Communications, Inc. is presented in the table below:\nThe summarized results of operations information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Sprint and Sprint Communications, Inc., since the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020, is presented in the table below:\nThe summarized balance sheet information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Sprint Capital Corporation is presented in the table below:\nThe summarized results of operations information for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by Sprint Capital Corporation, since the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020, is presented in the table below:\nPerformance Measures\nIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.\nThe performance measures presented below include the impact of the Merger on a prospective basis from the close date of April 1, 2020. Historical results were not restated.\nCustomers\nA customer is generally defined as a SIM number with a unique T-Mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Customers are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance of receiving service. Our postpaid customers include customers of T-Mobile. Our prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.\nThe following table sets forth the number of ending customers:\nNM - Not Meaningful\n(1) Includes customers acquired in connection with the Merger and certain customer base adjustments. See Customer Base Adjustments and Net Customer Additions tables below.\n(2) On July 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement whereby certain T-Mobile prepaid products will now be offered and distributed by a current MVNO partner. As a result, we included a base adjustment in the third quarter of 2019 to reduce prepaid customers by 616,000.\nTotal customers increased 34,170,000, or 50%, primarily from:\n\u2022Higher postpaid phone customers, primarily due to customers acquired in the Merger and the success of new customer segments and rate plans and continued growth in existing and new markets, along with promotional activities; and\n\u2022Higher postpaid other customers, primarily due to customers acquired in the Merger and growth in other connected devices primarily related to public and educational sector customers and wearable products; partially offset by\n\u2022Lower prepaid customers, primarily due to the customer base adjustments made to align the customer reporting policies of T-Mobile and Sprint, partially offset by the continued success of our prepaid business due to promotional activities and rate plan offers.\nCustomer Base Adjustments\nCertain adjustments were made to align the customer reporting policies of T-Mobile and Sprint.\nThe adjustments made to the reported T-Mobile and Sprint ending customer base as of March 31, 2020, are presented below:\n(1) In connection with the closing of the Merger, we refined our definition of wholesale customers resulting in the reclassification of certain postpaid and prepaid reseller customers to wholesale customers. Starting with the three months ended March 31, 2020, we discontinued reporting wholesale customers to focus on postpaid and prepaid customers and wholesale revenues, which we consider more relevant than the number of wholesale customers given the expansion of M2M and IoT products.\n(2) Prepaid customers with a device installment billing plan historically included as Sprint postpaid customers have been reclassified to prepaid customers to align with T-Mobile policy.\n(3) Customers associated with the Sprint wireless prepaid and Boost Mobile brands that were divested on July 1, 2020, have been excluded from our reported customers.\n(4) Customers who have rate plans with monthly recurring charges which are considered insignificant have been excluded from our reported customers.\n(5) Customers with postpaid phone rate plans without a phone (e.g., non-phone devices) have been reclassified from postpaid phone to postpaid other customers to align with T-Mobile policy.\n(6) Certain Sprint customers subject to collection activity for an extended period of time have been excluded from our reported customers to align with T-Mobile policy.\n(7) Miscellaneous insignificant adjustments to align with T-Mobile policy.\nNet Customer Additions\nThe following table sets forth the number of net customer additions:\nNM - Not Meaningful\n(1) On July 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement whereby certain T-Mobile prepaid products will now be offered and distributed by a current MVNO partner. As a result, we included a base adjustment in the third quarter of 2019 to reduce prepaid customers by 616,000.\nTotal net customer additions increased 777,000, or 16%, primarily from:\n\u2022Higher postpaid other net customer additions, primarily due to higher gross additions from connected devices, primarily due to public and educational sector additions and lower churn, partially offset by lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the Pandemic; partially offset by\n\u2022Lower postpaid phone net customer additions, primarily due to higher churn from customers acquired in the Merger and lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the Pandemic; and\n\u2022Lower prepaid gross customer additions, partially offset by lower churn, both primarily due to lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the Pandemic.\nChurn\nChurn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.\nThe following table sets forth the churn:\nPostpaid phone churn was essentially flat, primarily due to the inclusion of the customer base acquired in the Merger with higher churn, offset by lower switching activity in the industry due to reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures arising from the Pandemic.\nPrepaid churn decreased 79 basis points, primarily due to lower switching activity in the industry due to reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures arising from the Pandemic and the continued success of our prepaid products due to promotional activities and rate plan offers.\nTotal Postpaid Accounts\nA postpaid account is generally defined as a billing account number that generates revenue. Postpaid accounts are generally comprised of customers that are qualified for postpaid service utilizing phones, wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices which include tablets and SyncUp products, where they generally pay after receiving service.\n(1) Includes accounts acquired in connection with the Merger and certain account base adjustments. See Account Base Adjustments table below.\nTotal postpaid customer accounts increased 10,707,000, or 71%, primarily due to 10,150,000 accounts acquired in the Merger, the success of new customer segments and rate plans, continued growth in existing and new markets, along with promotional activities, improvements in network quality and industry-leading customer service, partially offset by lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures resulting from the Pandemic.\nAccount Base Adjustments\nCertain adjustments were made to align the account reporting policies of T-Mobile and Sprint.\nThe adjustments made to the reported T-Mobile and Sprint ending account base as of March 31, 2020 are presented below:\n(1) In connection with the closing of the Merger, we refined our definition of wholesale accounts resulting in the reclassification of certain postpaid and prepaid reseller accounts to wholesale accounts.\n(2) Prepaid accounts with a customer with a device installment billing plan historically included as Sprint postpaid accounts have been reclassified to prepaid accounts to align with T-Mobile policy.\n(3) Accounts with customers who have rate plans with monthly recurring charges which are considered insignificant have been excluded from our reported accounts.\n(4) Certain Sprint accounts subject to collection activity for an extended period of time have been excluded from our reported accounts to align with T-Mobile policy.\n(5) Miscellaneous insignificant adjustments to align with T-Mobile policy.\nAverage Revenue Per User\nARPU represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices such as tablets and SyncUp products.\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of our operating measure ARPU and reconciles this measure to the related service revenues:\nPostpaid Phone ARPU\nPostpaid phone ARPU increased $1.70, or 4%, primarily due to:\n\u2022The net impact of customers acquired in the Merger, which have higher ARPU (net of changes arising from the reduction in base due to policy adjustments and reclassification of certain ARPU components from the acquired customers being moved to other revenue lines); and\n\u2022Higher premium service revenues; partially offset by\n\u2022An increase in our promotional activities.\nPrepaid ARPU\nPrepaid ARPU was essentially flat and was primarily impacted by:\n\u2022The impacts of certain adjustments to our customer base, including the removal of certain prepaid customers associated with products now offered and distributed by a current MVNO partner as those customers had lower ARPU; offset by\n\u2022Dilution from promotional rate plans; and\n\u2022A reduction in certain non-recurring charges.\nAverage Revenue Per Account\nAverage Revenue per Account (\u201cARPA\u201d) represents the average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. We believe postpaid ARPA provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our postpaid service revenue realization and assist in forecasting our future postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. We consider postpaid ARPA to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of postpaid phone customers per account and increases in postpaid other customers, including wearables, DIGITS or other connected devices, which include tablets and SyncUp products.\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of our operating measure ARPA and reconciles this measure to the related service revenues:\nPostpaid ARPA\nPostpaid ARPA increased $1.35, or 1%, primarily due to:\n\u2022An increase in customers per account, including further penetration in connected devices, and the success of new customer segments and rate plans;\n\u2022Higher premium service revenues; and\n\u2022The net impact of customers acquired in the Merger; partially offset by\n\u2022An increase in our promotional activities; and\n\u2022A reduction in certain non-recurring charges, including from the impact of the Pandemic.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, non-cash Stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our ongoing operating performance. Net income margin represents Net income divided by Service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, Merger-related costs including network decommissioning costs, incremental costs directly attributable to COVID-19 and impairment expense, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:\nNM - Not Meaningful\n(1)Following the Prepaid Transaction, starting on July 1, 2020, we provide MVNO services to DISH. We have included the operating income from discontinued operations from April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, in our determination of Adjusted EBITDA to reflect contributions of the Prepaid Business that were replaced by the MVNO Agreement beginning on July 1, 2020 in order to enable management, analysts and investors to better assess ongoing operating performance and trends.\n(2)Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the Transactions have been included in Merger-related costs.\n(3)Other, net may not agree to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur or are not reflective of T-Mobile\u2019s ongoing operating performance, and are therefore excluded in Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $11.2 billion, or 83%. The components comprising Adjusted EBITDA are discussed further above. The increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022Higher Total service revenues; and\n\u2022Higher Equipment revenues; partially offset by\n\u2022Higher Cost of services expenses, excluding Merger-related costs;\n\u2022Higher Cost of equipment sales; and\n\u2022Higher Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding Merger-related costs and supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and common stock, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). In connection with the closing of the Merger on April 1, 2020, we incurred a substantial amount of additional third-party indebtedness which increased our future financial commitments, including aggregate interest payments. Further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness, which\nmay make it more difficult for us to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Our Indebtedness.\u201d\nCash Flows\nThe following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.8 billion, or 27%, primarily from:\n\u2022Higher Net income, excluding non-cash income and expenses; partially offset by\n\u2022A $6.3 billion increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to the one-time impact of $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps related to Merger financing for the year ended December 31, 2020, included in the use of cash from Other current and long-term liabilities, as well as higher use of cash from Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Inventories.\n\u2022Net cash provided by operating activities includes $1.5 billion and $442 million in payments for Merger-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Net cash provided by operating activities includes $458 million in payments for supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $8.6 billion, or 208%. The use of cash was primarily from:\n\u2022$11.0 billion in Purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, from network integration related to the Merger and the continued build-out of our nationwide 5G network;\n\u2022$5.0 billion in cash paid for the acquisition of Sprint, net of cash and restricted cash acquired; and\n\u2022$1.3 billion in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits; partially offset by\n\u2022$3.1 billion in Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions;\n\u2022$1.2 billion in Proceeds from the divestiture of prepaid business; and\n\u2022$632 million related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, for more information regarding these contracts, see Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $15.4 billion. The source of cash was primarily from:\n\u2022$35.3 billion in Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of discounts and issuance costs, driven primarily by the issuance of $31.8 billion in Senior Secured Notes and a draw of $4.0 billion on the New Secured Term Loan Facility;\n\u2022$18.7 billion in Proceeds from the issuance of short-term debt, net of discounts and issuance costs, driven by a $19.0 billion draw on the New Secured Bridge Loan Facility in connection with the closing of the Merger; and\n\u2022$304 million in net proceeds from the SoftBank Equity transaction, see Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements; partially offset by\n\u2022$20.4 billion in Repayments of long-term debt driven by the repayment of $5.3 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes held by DT, our $4.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT, our $4.0 billion New Secured Term Loan Facility, $2.3 billion of outstanding principal for the termination of the accounts receivable facility assumed in the Merger, $4.2 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes held by third parties and $656 million\naggregate principal amount of our 3.360% Senior Secured Series 2016-1 A-1 Notes due 2021;\n\u2022$18.9 billion in Repayments of short-term debt, net of refunds for issuance costs, for the repayment of the $19.0 billion draw on the New Secured Bridge Loan Facility; and\n\u2022$1.0 billion in Repayments of financing lease obligations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2020, our Cash and cash equivalents were $10.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow represents Net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for Purchases of property and equipment, including Proceeds from sales of tower sites and Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, less Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.\nThe table below provides reconciliations of Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps to Net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nNM - Not Meaningful\nFree Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps related to Merger financing, decreased $1.3 billion, or 31%. The decrease was primarily impacted by the following:\n\u2022Higher Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $440 million and $473 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from network integration related to the Merger and the continued build-out of our nationwide 5G network; and\n\u2022Lower Proceeds related to our deferred purchase price from securitization transactions; partially offset by\n\u2022Higher Net cash provided by operating activities, as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the following:\n\u2022$1.5 billion and $442 million in payments for Merger-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\u2022$458 million in payments for supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022The calculation of Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, excludes the one-time impact of gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps related to Merger financing of $2.3 billion.\nBorrowing Capacity\nWe maintain a financing arrangement with Deutsche Bank AG, which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. Under the financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain vendors. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding balances under such financing arrangement.\nWe also maintain vendor financing arrangements primarily with our main network equipment suppliers. Under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. Additionally, we assumed financial liabilities with certain vendors in connection with the closing of the Merger and incurred additional financial liabilities with DISH at the closing of the Prepaid Transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repaid $481 million associated with the vendor financing arrangements and other financial liabilities, of which $342 million was associated with financial liabilities assumed in connection with the closing of the Merger. These payments are included in Repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment and other financial liabilities, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding balance under the vendor financing arrangements and other financial liabilities was $240 million and $25 million, respectively.\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions named therein, providing for a $4.0 billion secured term loan facility (the \u201cNew Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (the \u201cNew Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). On September 16, 2020, we increased the aggregate commitment under the New Revolving Credit Facility to $5.5 billion through an amendment to the Credit Agreement. On October 9, 2020, we repaid at par all of the outstanding amounts under, and terminated, our New Secured Term Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance under the New Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn October 30, 2020, we entered into a $5.0 billion senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 14, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion in Senior Notes. The senior secured term loan commitment was reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Senior Notes, which reduced the commitment to $2.0 billion. Up to $2.0 billion of loans under the commitment may be drawn at any time (subject to customary conditions precedent) through June 30, 2021. If drawn, the facility matures in 364 days with one six-month extension exercisable at our discretion. Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% per annum.\nDebt Financing\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total debt and financing lease liabilities were $73.6 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $66.5 billion was classified as long-term debt and $1.4 billion was classified as long-term financing lease liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued short- and long-term debt for net proceeds of $54.2 billion and redeemed and repaid short- and long-term debt with an aggregate principal amount of $39.9 billion. Additionally, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed certain indebtedness of Sprint totaling $31.8 billion.\nOn October 6, 2020, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $4.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 2.050% to 3.300% and maturing in 2028 through 2051. On October 9, 2020, we used the net proceeds of $4.0 billion to repay at par all of the outstanding amounts under, and terminate, our New Secured Term Loan Facility.\nOn October 28, 2020, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $4.75 billion in Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 2.250% to 3.600% and maturing in 2031 through 2060. We intend to use the net proceeds of $4.6 billion for general corporate purposes, which may include among other things, acquisitions of additional spectrum and refinancing existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis.\nOn October 30, 2020, we entered into a $5.0 billion senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 14, 2021, T-Mobile USA issued $1.0 billion of 2.250% Senior Notes due 2026, $1.0 billion of 2.625% Senior Notes due 2029, and $1.0 billion of 2.875% Senior Notes due 2031. We intend to use the net proceeds of $3.0 billion for general corporate purposes, which may include among other things, financing acquisitions of additional spectrum and refinancing existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis. A portion of the senior secured term loan commitments were reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Senior Notes, which reduced the commitment to $2.0 billion. Up to $2.0 billion of loans under the commitment may be drawn at any time (subject to customary conditions precedent) through June 30, 2021. If drawn, the facility matures in 364 days with one six-month extension exercisable at our discretion. Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% per annum.\nFor more information regarding our debt financing transactions, see Note 8 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSpectrum Auction\nIn March 2020, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 2,384 licenses in Auction 103 (37/39 GHz and 47 GHz spectrum bands) for an aggregate price of $873 million, net of an incentive payment of $59 million. At the inception of Auction 103 in October 2019, we deposited $82 million with the FCC. Upon conclusion of Auction 103 in March 2020, we made a down payment of $93 million for the purchase price of the licenses won in the auction. On April 8, 2020, we paid the FCC the remaining $698 million of the purchase price for the licenses won in the auction. Prior to the Merger, the FCC announced that Sprint was the winning bidder of 127 licenses in Auction 103 (37/39 GHz and 47 GHz spectrum bands). All payments related to the licenses won were made by Sprint prior the Merger.\nFor more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Rate Lock Derivatives\nIn April 2020, in connection with the issuance of an aggregate of $19.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes, we terminated our interest rate lock derivative. At the time of termination, the interest rate lock derivatives were a liability of $2.3 billion, of which $1.2 billion was cash collateralized. Consequently, the net cash required to settle the interest rate lock derivatives was an additional $1.1 billion and was paid at termination.\nFor more information regarding the termination of our interest rate lock derivative, see Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Sources and Uses of Liquidity\nWe may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2021, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. Excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, or for other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. Our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and the execution of our integration plan.\nWe determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. We have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses as a result of completing the Transactions, the Divestiture Transaction and compliance with the Government Commitments, and we are also expected to incur substantial restructuring expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating T-Mobile\u2019s and Sprint\u2019s businesses, operations, policies and procedures. While we have assumed that a certain level of Merger-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control, including required consultation and negotiation with certain counterparties, could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. These expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There are a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including those due to the impact of the Pandemic, that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risk Related to our\nBusiness and Wireless Industry - The Pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results.\u201d\nThe indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers or borrowers and the Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuers or borrowers to loan funds or make payments to Parent. However, the Issuers or borrowers are allowed to make certain permitted payments to Parent under the terms of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Merger\nIn connection with the closing of the Merger, on April 1, 2020, we assumed Sprint\u2019s liabilities, which include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term debt, operating and financing lease liabilities, net pension plan liabilities, deferred tax liabilities and long-term debt with an aggregate fair value of $31.8 billion.\nFor more information regarding the Merger, see Note 2 - Business Combination of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShentel Wireless Asset Acquisition\nSprint PCS (specifically Sprint Spectrum L.P.) is party to a variety of publicly filed agreements with Shenandoah Personal Communications Company LLC (\u201cShentel\u201d), pursuant to which Shentel is the exclusive provider of Sprint PCS\u2019s wireless mobility communications network products in certain parts of Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Pursuant to one such agreement, the Sprint PCS Management Agreement, dated November 5, 1999 (as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time, the \u201cManagement Agreement\u201d), Sprint PCS was granted an option to purchase Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunications assets used to provide services pursuant to the Management Agreement. On August 26, 2020, Sprint, now our indirect subsidiary, on behalf of and as the direct or indirect owner of Sprint PCS, exercised its option by delivering a binding notice of exercise to Shentel. T-Mobile\u2019s exercise of its option triggered a requirement for the parties to engage three independent valuation providers (the \u201cValuation Providers\u201d) to calculate the \u201centire business value\u201d (the \u201cEntire Business Value\u201d) of such wireless telecommunications assets, pursuant to a formula and valuation process prescribed in the Management Agreement.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on February 1, 2021, in accordance with the Management Agreement and other agreed-upon terms, the Valuation Providers determined and calculated the Entire Business Value of Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunications assets used to provide services pursuant to the Management Agreement to be $2.1 billion, and correspondingly, the base purchase price for such wireless telecommunications assets shall be ninety percent (90%) of that Entire Business Value amount ($1.9 billion), subject to certain other purchase price adjustments prescribed by the Management Agreement and such additional purchase price adjustments agreed by the parties. The parties are negotiating the remaining outstanding terms of a definitive agreement to govern the purchase of Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunication assets and expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021 after satisfying customary conditions to closing.\nFinancing Lease Facilities\nWe have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain partners that provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. As of December 31, 2020, we have committed to $5.1 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $1.2 billion was executed during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect to enter into up to an additional $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during the year ending December 31, 2021.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure and the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of T-Mobile and Sprint. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to the integration of our acquired Sprint 2.5 GHz spectrum licenses and existing 600 MHz spectrum licenses as we build out our\nnationwide 5G network. We expect the majority of our remaining capital expenditures related to these efforts to occur in 2021 and 2022, after which we expect capital expenditure requirements to reduce.\nWe expect cash purchases of property and equipment to range from $11.7 billion to $12.0 billion in 2021.\nFor more information regarding our property and equipment and spectrum licenses, see Note 5 - Property and Equipment and Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.\nDividends\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock.\nContractual Obligations\nIn connection with the regulatory approvals of the Transactions, we made commitments to various state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) and FCC.\nFor more information regarding these commitments, see Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe contractual commitments and purchase obligations of Sprint were assumed upon the completion of the Merger. These contractual commitments and purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business.\nFor more information regarding our contractual commitments and purchase obligations, see Note 18- Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2020, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:\n(1)Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs, consent fees, and financing lease obligations. See Note 8 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n(2)Future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments, related to the tower obligations. See Note 9 - Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n(3)The minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. Termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. For certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. This table does not include open purchase orders as of December 31, 2020 under normal business purposes. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n(4)Spectrum lease agreements are typically for five to 10 years with automatic renewal provisions, bringing the total term of the agreements up to 30 years.\nCertain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. Other long-term liabilities have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the lack of historical trends to predict future payments. See Note 20 - Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. Where we are committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether we take delivery, we have included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. The acquisition of spectrum licenses is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.\nRelated Party Transactions\nSoftBank\nOn February 20, 2020, T-Mobile, SoftBank and DT entered into a Letter Agreement as described in Note 2 - Business Combination. The Letter Agreement requires T-Mobile to issue to SoftBank 48,751,557 shares of T-Mobile common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Letter Agreement, for no additional consideration, if certain conditions are met.\nOn June 22, 2020, we entered into a Master Framework Agreement and related transactions with SoftBank to facilitate the SoftBank Monetization as described in Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2020, DT and SoftBank held, directly or indirectly, approximately 43.4% and 8.6%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock, with the remaining approximately 48.0% of our outstanding common stock held by other stockholders. As a result of the Proxy Agreements, DT has voting control as of December 31, 2020, over approximately 52.3% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock. In addition, as provided for in the Master Framework Agreement, DT also holds certain call options over approximately 101.5 million shares of our common stock held by SoftBank Group Capital Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of SoftBank.\nOn July 27, 2020, in connection with the SoftBank Monetization, the Rights Offering exercise period closed, and on August 3, 2020, the Rights Offering closed, resulting in the sale of 19,750,000 shares of our common stock.\nFor more information regarding our related party transactions with SoftBank, see Note 2 - Business Combination and Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMarcelo Claure\nOn June 22, 2020, we entered into a Master Framework Agreement which provided for the purchase of shares of our common stock by Marcelo Claure, a member of our board of directors, from us at a specified price.\nFor more information regarding our related party transactions with Marcelo Claure, see Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBrightstar\nWe had arrangements with Brightstar, a subsidiary of SoftBank, whereby Brightstar provided supply chain and inventory management services to us in our indirect channels.\nFor more information regarding our related party transactions with Brightstar, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 20 - Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeutsche Telekom\nWe have related party transactions associated with DT or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.\nFor more information regarding these transactions, see Note 20 - Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we repaid our $4.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT and repurchased from DT $4.0 billion of indebtedness to affiliates, consisting of $2.0 billion of 5.300% Senior Notes due\n2021 and $2.0 billion of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 as well as made an additional payment for requisite consents to DT of $13 million.\nOn July 4, 2020, we redeemed $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2021.\nFor more information regarding our related party debt transactions, see Note 8 - Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDisclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nSection 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.\nAs of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2020, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with either DT or SoftBank. We have relied upon DT and SoftBank for information regarding their respective activities, transactions and dealings.\nDT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Irancell Telecommunications Services Company, Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to three customers in Germany identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control: Bank Melli, Bank Sepah, and Europ\u00e4isch-Iranische Handelsbank. These services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross revenues of all DT affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the Iranian parties identified herein were less than $0.1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $0.1 million.\nIn addition, DT, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate a fixed-line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were less than $0.1 million. We understand that DT intends to continue these activities.\nSeparately, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, provides roaming services in Iran through Irancell Telecommunications Services Company. During the nine months from the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, SoftBank had no gross revenues from such services and no net profit was generated. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such services. This subsidiary also provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to accounts affiliated with the Embassy of Iran in Japan. During the nine months from the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, SoftBank estimates that gross revenues and net profit generated by such services were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary is obligated under contract and intends to continue such services.\nIn addition, SoftBank, through one of its non-U.S. indirect subsidiaries, provides office supplies to the Embassy of Iran in Japan. SoftBank estimates that gross revenue and net profit generated by such services during the nine months from the acquisition of Sprint on April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, were both under $0.1 million. We understand that the SoftBank subsidiary intends to continue such activities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain EIP accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, we derecognized net receivables of $2.5 billion upon sale through these arrangements.\nFor more information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 4 - Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThree of these policies, discussed below, are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nManagement and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.\nDepreciation\nOur property and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record property and equipment at cost, and we generally depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a one-year increase in the useful lives of our in-service property and equipment, exclusive of leased devices, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $2.9 billion in our 2020 depreciation expense and that a one-year decrease in the useful life would have resulted in an increase of approximately $3.5 billion in our 2020 depreciation expense.\nSee Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 - Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management\u2019s underlying estimates of useful lives.\nEvaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, are not amortized but tested for potential impairment annually, as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired.\nWe test goodwill on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value. If the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. We have identified two reporting units for which discrete financial information is available and results are regularly reviewed by management: wireless and Layer3. The Layer3 reporting unit consists of the assets and liabilities of Layer3 TV, Inc., which was acquired in January 2018. The services provided by the Layer3 reporting unit are branded TVisionTM. The wireless reporting unit consists of the remaining assets and liabilities of T-Mobile US, Inc., excluding Layer3 TV, Inc. We separately evaluate these reporting units for impairment.\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We employed a qualitative approach to assess the wireless reporting unit. The fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying\naggregate fair value. No events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit may be below its carrying amount at December 31, 2020.\nConcurrent with the consummation of the Merger, management also revisited the plans for our TVisionTM services offering and the integration of this offering with the Sprint customer base. Additionally, we expect our significantly enhanced spectrum position following the Merger will allow us to accelerate our in-home broadband internet service strategy. The enhanced in-home broadband opportunity, along with the acquisition of certain content rights, created a strategic shift in our TVisionTM services offering allowing us the ability to develop a video product which will be complementary to the in-home broadband offering. Based on these events and changes in circumstances, we determined that recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill for the Layer3 reporting unit should be evaluated for impairment. We employed a quantitative approach to assess the Layer3 reporting unit. The fair value of the Layer3 reporting unit was determined using an income approach, which was based on estimated discounted future cash flows.\nWe made estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates to determine the reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value. The key assumptions used were as follows:\n\u2022Expected cash flows underlying the TVisionTM business plan for the periods 2020 through 2025, which took into account assumptions for a delayed launch, estimates of subscribers for TVisionTM services, average revenue and content cost per subscriber, operating costs and capital expenditures;\n\u2022Cash flows beyond 2025 were projected to grow at a long-term growth rate estimated at 3%. Estimating a long-term growth rate requires significant judgment about future business strategies as well as micro- and macro-economic environments that are inherently uncertain; and\n\u2022We used a discount rate of 30% to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining the estimated fair value.\nThe carrying value of the Layer3 reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value as of June 30, 2020. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment loss of $218 million, which is included in Impairment expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. This impairment reduced the goodwill assigned to the Layer3 reporting unit to zero.\nWe test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a\nnational level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative\nassessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses) and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.\nThe valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum\nlicenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future\nexpectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on\ngoodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues,\nEBITDA margins, capital expenditures and long-term growth rate.\nFor more information regarding our impairment assessments, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nFor information regarding recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to economic risks in the normal course of business, primarily from changes in interest rates, including changes in investment yields and changes in spreads due to credit risk and other factors. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. Our policy is to manage exposure related to fluctuations in interest rates in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. We have established interest rate risk limits that are closely monitored by measuring interest rate sensitivities of our debt portfolio. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies used to manage market risk in the near future.\nCertain potential sources of financing available to us, including our senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions and New Revolving Credit Facility, bear interest that is indexed to LIBOR plus a fixed margin.

    "item_8": "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of T-Mobile US, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues in 2018.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded certain elements of the internal control over financial reporting of Sprint from its assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2020. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company integrated certain elements of Sprint\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and related processes into the Company\u2019s existing systems, internal control over financial reporting and related processes. The Sprint controls that were not integrated have been excluded from management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. We have also excluded these elements of the internal\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontrol over financial reporting of Sprint from our audit of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. The excluded elements of Sprint represent controls over approximately 14% of consolidated assets and approximately 30% of the consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAcquisition of Sprint Corporation - Accounting and Valuation of the Acquired Spectrum License Portfolio\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed its acquisition of Sprint Corporation for a total consideration of $40.8 billion on April 1, 2020. The Company measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value, which resulted in the recognition of $45.4 billion of Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) spectrum licenses, a portion of which relates to lease agreements (the \u201cAgreements\u201d) with various educational and non-profit institutions that provide the Company with the right to use FCC spectrum licenses (Educational Broadband Services or \u201cEBS spectrum\u201d) in the 2.5 GHz band. Management applied judgment in determining the Agreements enhance the overall value of the Company's owned spectrum licenses as the collective value is higher than the value of individual bands of spectrum within a specific geography. This enhanced value from combining owned and leased spectrum licenses is referred to as an aggregation premium, which is a component of the overall fair value of FCC spectrum licenses, which are recognized as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Management also applied judgment in estimating the overall value of the Spectrum License portfolio using the income approach, specifically a Greenfield model, which involved the use of key assumptions with respect to the discount rate, market share, estimated capital and operating expenditures, forecasted service revenue and long-term growth rate for a hypothetical market participant that enters the wireless industry and builds a nationwide wireless network.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting and valuation of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio in the acquisition of Sprint Corporation is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the accounting for the leased EBS spectrum arrangements, as well as estimating the fair value of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s accounting for the leased EBS spectrum portion of the portfolio as well as evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the discount rate, market share, estimated capital and operating expenditures, forecasted service revenue and long-term growth rate used in estimating the fair value of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the accounting for the leased EBS spectrum arrangements and estimating the fair value of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement and Spectrum License lease agreements; (ii) evaluating management\u2019s assessment related to the accounting for the leased EBS spectrum arrangements; and (iii) testing\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the fair value of the acquired Spectrum License portfolio. Testing management\u2019s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodology, and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the discount rate, market share, estimated capital and operating expenditures, forecasted service revenue and long-term growth rate. Evaluating the significant assumptions included considering (i) the cost of capital of comparable businesses and consistency with other valuations for the discount rate; (ii) industry factors and historical results for market share; (iii) historical results, and industry data for the estimated capital and operating expenditures and forecasted service revenue assumptions; and (iv) industry and market factors for the long-term growth rate. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions.\nAcquisition of Sprint Corporation - Accounting for the Acquired Lease-out and Leaseback Arrangement with Crown Castle International Corp.\nAs described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in the acquisition of Sprint Corporation, the Company measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value, which resulted in the recognition of property and equipment with a fair value of $2.8 billion and tower obligations related to amounts owed to Crown Castle International Corp. (\u201cCCI\u201d) under the leaseback of $1.1 billion. Additionally, $1.7 billion in other long-term liabilities were recognized associated with contract terms that are unfavorable to current market rates, which includes unfavorable terms associated with the fixed-price purchase option in 2037. Prior to the Merger, Sprint entered into a lease-out and leaseback arrangement with Global Signal Inc., a third party that was subsequently acquired by CCI, that conveyed to CCI the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 6,400 tower sites via prepaid master lease. These agreements were assumed upon the close of the Merger, at which point the remaining term of the lease-out was approximately 17 years with no renewal options. CCI has a fixed-price purchase option for all (but not less than all) of the leased or subleased sites for approximately $2.3 billion, exercisable one year prior to the expiration of the agreement and ending 120 days prior to the expiration of the agreement. The Company leases back a portion of the space at certain tower sites for an initial term of 10 years, followed by optional renewals at customary terms.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the acquired lease-out and leaseback arrangement with CCI in the acquisition of Sprint Corporation is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the accounting to reflect the acquisition of the tower lease arrangement; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s accounting for and presentation of the owned leased asset and related liabilities and identification of each unit of account within the transaction; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the accounting for acquired lease-out and leaseback arrangement with CCI. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement and Global Signal Inc. lease agreements; (ii) evaluating management\u2019s accounting for and presentation of the owned leased asset and related liabilities; and (iii) evaluating management\u2019s identification of each unit of account within the transaction. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating management\u2019s accounting assessment of the acquired lease-out and leaseback arrangement with CCI.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 23, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2001.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nT-Mobile US, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nT-Mobile US, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nT-Mobile US, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nT-Mobile US, Inc.\nConsolidated Statement of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\n(1)Prior year Retained Earnings represents the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards on beginning Accumulated Deficit and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.

We operate as a single operating segment.\nOn April 29, 2018, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the \u201cBusiness Combination Agreement\u201d) to merge with Sprint Corporation (\u201cSprint\u201d) in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile common stock for each share of Sprint common stock, or 9.75 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock (the \u201cMerger\u201d). On April 1, 2020, we completed the Merger and acquired Sprint (see Note 2 - Business Combination).\nOn July 26, 2019, pursuant to the requirement as set forth in the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) complaint and proposed final judgement (the \u201cConsent Decree\u201d), T-Mobile entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Sprint and DISH Network Corporation (\u201cDISH\u201d). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, on July 1, 2020, DISH acquired the prepaid wireless business operated under the Boost Mobile and Sprint prepaid brands (excluding the Assurance brand Lifeline customers and the prepaid wireless customers of Shenandoah Telecommunications Company and Swiftel Communications, Inc.), including customer accounts, inventory, contracts, intellectual property and certain other specified assets (the \u201cPrepaid Business\u201d) and assumed certain related liabilities (the \u201cPrepaid Transaction\u201d). Upon closing of the Prepaid Transaction, we received $1.4 billion from DISH, subject to a working capital adjustment.\nThe revenues and expenses of the Prepaid Business are presented as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including but not limited to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through the Merger with Sprint and the potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (the \u201cPandemic\u201d). These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.\nBusiness Combination\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfuture revenues and expenses associated with an asset or liability. See Note 2 - Business Combination for further discussion of the Merger between T-Mobile and Sprint.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.\nReceivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consists primarily of amounts currently due from customers (e.g., for wireless services and monthly device lease payments), device insurance administrators, wholesale partners, other carriers and third-party retail channels. Accounts receivable are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amortized cost basis (i.e., the receivables\u2019 outstanding principal balance adjusted for any write-offs), net of the allowance for expected credit losses. We have an arrangement to sell certain of our customer service accounts receivable on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets.\nEquipment Installment Plan Receivables\nWe offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments, generally over a period of 24 months using an EIP. EIP receivables are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amortized cost basis (i.e., the receivables\u2019 unpaid principal balance adjusted for any write-offs and unamortized discounts), net of the allowance for expected credit losses. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the receivables. The receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting expected future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. This adjustment results in a discount or reduction in transaction price which is allocated to the performance obligations and reduces Service revenues and Equipment revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The imputed discount rate is the current market interest rate and is predominately comprised of the estimated credit risk underlying the EIP receivable, reflecting the estimated credit worthiness of the customer. The imputed discount on receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe current portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables, net and the long-term portion of the EIP receivables is included in Equipment installment plan receivables due after one year, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have an arrangement to sell certain EIP receivables on a revolving basis, which are treated as sales of financial assets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for expected credit losses and determine its appropriateness through an established process that assesses the lifetime credit losses that we expect to incur related to our receivable portfolio. Our process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our accounts receivable and EIP receivable portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, losses are estimated collectively for groups of receivables with similar characteristics. Our allowance levels are influenced by receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions that affect loss expectations, such as changes in credit and collections policies and forecasts of macro-economic conditions. While we attribute portions of the allowance to our respective accounts receivable and EIP portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to credit losses related to the total receivable portfolio.\nWe consider a receivable past due and delinquent when a customer has not paid us by the contractually specified payment due date. Account balances are written off against the allowance for credit losses if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible (customer default), based on factors such as customer credit ratings as well as the length of time the amounts are past due.\nIf there is a deterioration of our customers\u2019 financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general\ndiffer from those currently anticipated, we will adjust our allowance for credit losses accordingly, which may materially affect our financial results in the period the adjustments are made.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of wireless devices and accessories, which are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using standard cost which approximates average cost. Shipping and handling costs paid to wireless device and accessories vendors as well as costs to refurbish used devices are included in the standard cost of inventory. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of disposal and transportation. We record inventory write-downs to net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving items based on inventory turnover trends and historical experience.\nDeferred Purchase Price Assets\nIn connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including estimated customer default rates and credit worthiness. See Note 4 - Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets include assets that do not have indefinite lives, such as property and equipment and other intangible assets. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators of impairment are present, we test recoverability. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the asset or asset group\u2019s carrying amount, then an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consists of buildings and equipment, wireless communications systems, leasehold improvements, capitalized software, leased wireless devices and construction in progress. Buildings and equipment include certain network server equipment. Wireless communications systems include assets to operate our wireless network and IT data centers, including tower assets and leasehold improvements and assets related to the liability for the retirement of long-lived assets. Leasehold improvements include asset improvements other than those related to the wireless network.\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any, in Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit using the straight-line method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term.\nCosts of major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures which do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Construction costs, labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of our wireless network are capitalized. Capitalization commences with pre-construction period administrative and technical activities, which include obtaining zoning approvals and building permits, and ceases at the point at which the asset is ready for its intended use. We capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related assets.\nWe record an asset retirement obligation for the estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Our obligations relate primarily\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nto certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative assets are located.\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software. Capitalization of software costs commences once the final selection of the specific software solution has been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project and ceases once the project is ready for its intended use. Capitalized software costs are included in Property and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred.\nDevice Leases\nThrough the Merger, we acquired device lease contracts in which Sprint is the lessor (the \u201cSprint Flex Lease Program\u201d), substantially all of which are classified as operating leases, as well as the associated fixed assets (i.e., the leased devices). These leased devices were recorded as fixed assets at their acquisition date fair value and presented within Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur leasing programs (\u201cLeasing Programs\u201d), which include JUMP! On Demand and the Sprint Flex Lease Program acquired through the Merger, allow customers to lease a device (handset or tablet) over a period of, generally, 18 months and upgrade it for a new device when eligibility requirements are met. We depreciate leased devices to their estimated residual value, on a group basis, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the device. The estimated useful life reflects the period for which we estimate the group of leased devices will provide utility to us, which may be longer than the initial lease term based on customer options in the Sprint Flex Lease program to renew the lease on a month-to-month basis after the initial lease term concludes. In determining the estimated useful life, we consider the lease term (e.g., 18 months and month-to-month renewal options for the Sprint Flex Lease Program), trade-in activity and write-offs for lost and stolen devices. Lost and stolen devices are incorporated into the estimates of depreciation expense and recognized as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation when the loss event occurs. Our policy of using the group method of depreciation has been applied to acquired leased devices as well as leases originated subsequent to the Merger. Acquired leased devices are grouped based on the age of the device. Revenues associated with the leased wireless devices, net of lease incentives, are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nFor arrangements in which we are the lessor of wireless devices, we separate lease and non-lease components.\nUpon device upgrade or at lease end, customers in the JUMP! On Demand lease program must return or purchase their device, and customers in the Sprint Flex Lease Program have the option to return or purchase their device or to renew their lease on a month-to-month basis. The purchase price of the device is established at lease commencement and is based on the type of device leased and any down payment made. The Leasing Programs do not contain any residual value guarantees or variable lease payments, and there are no restrictions or covenants imposed by these leases. Returned devices, including those received upon device upgrade, are transferred from Property and equipment, net to Inventory on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with any write-down recognized as Cost of equipment sales in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nOther Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets that do not have indefinite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Customer lists and the Sprint trade name are amortized using the sum-of-the-years digits method over the period in which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is allocated to our two reporting units, wireless and Layer3.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSpectrum Licenses\nSpectrum licenses are carried at costs incurred to acquire the spectrum licenses and the costs to prepare the spectrum licenses for their intended use, such as costs to clear acquired spectrum licenses. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) issues spectrum licenses which provide us with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service areas to provide wireless communications services. While spectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically for up to 15 years, the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses held by us expire at various dates. We believe we will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum licenses at nominal costs. Moreover, we determined there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our spectrum licenses. Therefore, we determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nAt times, we enter into agreements to sell or exchange spectrum licenses. Upon entering into the arrangement, if the transaction has been deemed to have commercial substance, spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment. The licenses are transferred at their carrying value, as adjusted for any impairment recognized, to assets held for sale, which is included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until approval and completion of the exchange or sale. Upon closing of the transaction, spectrum licenses acquired as part of an exchange of nonmonetary assets are recorded at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum licenses obtained, carrying value of the spectrum licenses transferred and cash paid, if any, is recognized as a Gain (loss) on disposal of spectrum licenses included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Our fair value estimates of spectrum licenses are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data. If the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable, the acquired spectrum licenses are recorded at our carrying value of the spectrum assets transferred or exchanged.\nSpectrum Leases\nThrough the Merger, the Company acquired lease agreements (the \u201cAgreements\u201d) with various educational and non-profit institutions that provide us with the right to use FCC spectrum licenses (Educational Broadband Services or \u201cEBS spectrum\u201d) in the 2.5 GHz band. In addition to the Agreements with educational institutions and private owners who hold the licenses, the Company also acquired direct ownership of spectrum licenses previously acquired by Sprint through government auctions or other acquisitions.\nThe Agreements with educational and certain non-profit institutions are typically for five to 10 years with automatic renewal provisions, bringing the total term of the agreement up to 30 years. A majority of the Agreements include a right of first refusal to acquire, lease or otherwise use the license at the end of the automatic renewal periods.\nLeased FCC spectrum licenses are recorded as executory contracts whereby, as a result of business combination accounting, an intangible asset or liability is recorded reflecting the extent to which contractual terms are favorable or unfavorable to current market rates. These intangible assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the lease agreements. Contractual lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the arrangement, including renewals, and are presented in Costs of services within our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe Agreements enhance the overall value of the Company\u2019s owned spectrum licenses as the collective value is higher than the value of individual bands of spectrum within a specific geography. This value is derived from the ability to provide wireless service to customers across large geographic areas and maintain the same or similar wireless connectivity quality. This enhanced value from combining owned and leased spectrum licenses is referred to as an aggregation premium.\nThe aggregation premium is a component of the overall fair value of our owned FCC spectrum licenses, which are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nImpairment\nWe assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired.\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the two reporting units, wireless and Layer3, is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\namount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWe test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. If the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. We estimate fair value using the Greenfield methodology, which is an income approach based on discounted cash flows associated with the intangible asset, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.\nRestricted Cash\nCertain provisions of our debt agreements require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash and are included within Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGuarantee Liabilities\nWe offer a device trade-in program, Just Upgrade My Phone (\u201cJUMP!\u201d), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Upon enrollment, participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an EIP and have a qualifying T-Mobile monthly wireless service plan. Upon a qualifying JUMP! program upgrade, the customer\u2019s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP.\nFor customers who enroll in JUMP!, we recognize a liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. When customers upgrade their device, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs based on the observability as of the measurement date, is as follows:\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; and\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nAssets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities being measured within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable, Accounts receivable from affiliates, Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and borrowings under our vendor financing arrangements approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying values of EIP receivables approximate fair value as the receivables are recorded at their present value using an imputed interest rate. With the exception of certain long-term fixed-rate debt, there were no financial instruments with a carrying value materially different from their fair value. See Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements for a comparison of the carrying values and fair values of our short-term and long-term debt.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges associated with forecasted debt issuances, changes in fair value are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until reclassified into Interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, generally over the life of the related debt. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition (Effective January 1, 2018)\nWe primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. Our contracts with customers may involve multiple performance obligations, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.\nSignificant Judgments\nThe most significant judgments affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with our customers include the following items:\n\u2022Revenue for service contracts that we assess are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed or terminated and cash is received. Collectibility is re-assessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. Our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent as well as certain contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See \u201cReceivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d above, for additional discussion on how we assess credit risk.\n\u2022Promotional EIP bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. Determining whether contingent EIP bill credits result in a substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment.\n\u2022The identification of distinct performance obligations within our service plans may require significant judgment.\n\u2022Revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). For example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither control a right to the content provider\u2019s service nor control the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. The determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires, at times, significant judgment.\n\u2022Our products are generally sold with a right of return, which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Device return levels are estimated based on the expected value method as there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others. Historical return rate experience is a significant input to our expected value methodology.\n\u2022Sales of equipment to indirect dealers who have been identified as our customer (referred to as the sell-in model) often include credits subsequently paid to the dealer as a reimbursement for any discount promotions offered to the end consumer. These credits (payments to a customer, the dealer) are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sales of equipment to indirect dealers and are estimated based on historical experience and other factors, such as expected promotional activity.\n\u2022The determination of the standalone selling price for contracts that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment, such as when the selling price of a good or service is not readily observable.\nWireless Services Revenue\nWe generate our wireless services revenues from providing access to, and usage of, our wireless communications network. Service revenues also include revenues earned for providing premium services to customers, such as device insurance services. Service contracts are billed monthly either in advance or arrears, or are prepaid. Generally, service revenue is recognized as we\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nsatisfy our performance obligation to transfer service to our customers. We typically satisfy our stand-ready performance obligations, including unlimited wireless services, evenly over the contract term. For usage-based and prepaid wireless services, we satisfy our performance obligations when services are rendered.\nConsideration payable to a customer is treated as a reduction of the total transaction price, unless the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service, such as certain commissions paid to dealers, in which case the payment is treated as a purchase of that distinct good or service.\nFederal Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) and other fees are assessed by various governmental authorities in connection with the services we provide to our customers and are included in Cost of services. When we separately bill and collect these regulatory fees from customers, they are recorded gross in Total service revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded approximately $267 million, $93 million and $161 million, respectively, of USF fees on a gross basis.\nWe have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by us from a customer (e.g., sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes).\nWireline Revenue\nPerformance obligations related to our Wireline customers include the provision of domestic and international data communications services, generally to complement business wireless customers. Wireline revenues are included within Roaming and other service revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nEquipment Revenues\nWe generate equipment revenues from the sale or lease of mobile communication devices and accessories. For performance obligations related to equipment contracts, we typically transfer control at a point in time when the device or accessory is delivered to, and accepted by, the customer or dealer. We have elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers as fulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as performance obligations. We estimate variable consideration (e.g., device returns or certain payments to indirect dealers) primarily based on historical experience. Equipment sales not probable of collection are generally recorded as payments are received. Our assessment of collectibility considers contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk.\nWe offer certain customers the option to pay for devices and accessories in installments using an EIP. Generally, we recognize as a reduction of the total transaction price the effects of a financing component in contracts where customers purchase their devices and accessories on an EIP with a term of more than one year, including those financing components that are not considered to be significant to the contract. However, we have elected the practical expedient to not recognize the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of a performance obligation to a customer and the customer\u2019s payment for that performance obligation will be one year or less.\nIn addition, for customers who enroll in our JUMP! program, we recognize a liability based on the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The fair value of the guarantee is deducted from the transaction price and the remaining transaction price is allocated to other elements of the contract, including service and equipment performance obligations. See \u201cGuarantee Liabilities\u201d above for further information.\nJUMP! On Demand allows customers to lease a device over a period of up to 18 months and upgrade it for a new device up to one time per month. To date, substantially all of our leased wireless devices are accounted for as operating leases and estimated contract consideration is allocated between lease and non-lease elements (such as service and equipment performance obligations) based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation in the contract. Lease revenues are recorded as equipment revenues and recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease revenues on contracts not probable of collection are limited to the amount of payments received. See \u201cProperty and Equipment\u201d above for further information.\nAdvertising and Search Revenues\nEffective April 1, 2020, certain of our advertising and search revenues are now presented within Roaming and other service revenues, resulting in a reclassification of $506 million and $449 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nrespectively. These revenues were previously presented within Other revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nImputed Interest on EIP Receivables\nWe record the effects of financing on all EIP loans regardless of whether or not the financing is considered to be significant. The imputation of interest results in a discount of the EIP receivable, thereby adjusting the transaction price of the contract with the customer, which is then allocated to the performance obligations of the arrangement.\nFor transactions where we recognize a significant financing component, judgment is required to determine the discount rate. For EIP sales, the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk of the customer. Customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. See \u201cReceivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d above, for additional discussion on how we assess credit risk.\nFor indirect channel loans to the end service customer in which the sale of the device was to the dealer (sell-in basis), the effect of imputing interest is recognized as a reduction to service revenue, the only performance obligation with the service customer as the device sale was recognized when transferred to the dealer, over the service contract period.\nOur policies for imputed interest on EIP receivables are applied to loans originated for Sprint and Boost (up to the sale of the Prepaid Business to DISH on July 1, 2020) customers subsequent to Merger close.\nContract Balances\nGenerally, our devices and service plans are available at standard prices, which are maintained on price lists and published on our website and/or within our retail stores.\nFor contracts that involve more than one product or service that are identified as separate performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell the good or service separately to a customer and is most commonly evidenced by the price at which we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.\nA contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to receive consideration (i.e., we must perform additional services in order to receive consideration). Amounts are recorded as receivables when our right to consideration is unconditional. When consideration is received, or we have an unconditional right to consideration in advance of delivery of goods or services, a contract liability is recorded. The transaction price can include non-refundable upfront fees, which are allocated to the identifiable performance obligations.\nContract assets are included in Other current assets and Other assets and contract liabilities are included in Deferred revenue in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nContract Modifications\nOur service contracts allow customers to frequently modify their contracts without incurring penalties, in many cases. Each time a contract is modified, we evaluate the change in scope or price of the contract to determine if the modification should be treated as a separate contract, as if there is a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract, or if the modification should be considered a change associated with the existing contract. We typically do not have significant impacts from contract modifications.\nContract Costs\nWe incur certain incremental costs to obtain a contract that we expect to recover, such as sales commissions. We record an asset when these incremental costs to obtain a contract are incurred and amortize them on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates.\nWe capitalize postpaid sales commissions for service activation as costs to acquire a contract and amortize them over the estimated period of benefit, currently 24 months. For capitalized contract costs, determining the amortization period over which such costs are recognized as well as assessing the indicators of impairment may require significant judgment. Prepaid commissions are expensed as incurred as their estimated period of benefit does not extend beyond 12 months. Commissions\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\npaid upon device upgrade are not capitalized if the remaining customer contract is less than one year. Commissions paid when the customer has a lease are treated as initial direct costs and recognized over the lease term.\nOur policies for the capitalization and amortization of costs to acquire a contract are applied to the Sprint, Boost (up to the sale of the Prepaid Business to Dish on July 1, 2020) and Assurance Wireless brands subsequent to the Merger close.\nIncremental costs to obtain equipment contracts (e.g., commissions paid on device and accessory sales) are recognized when the equipment is transferred to the customer.\nBrightstar Distribution\nWe had arrangements with Brightstar US, Inc. (\u201cBrightstar\u201d), a subsidiary of SoftBank, whereby Brightstar provided supply chain and inventory management services to us in our indirect channels. T-Mobile sold devices through Brightstar to T-Mobile indirect channels who then sold the device to an end customer.\nThe supply chain and inventory management arrangement included, among other things, that Brightstar may purchase inventory from the original equipment manufacturers to sell through to our indirect channels. As compensation for these services, we remitted per unit fees to Brightstar for each device sold to these indirect dealers.\nDevices sold from T-Mobile to Brightstar do not meet the criteria for a sale. Devices transferred from T-Mobile to Brightstar remain in inventory until control is transferred upon the sale of the device to the end customer, and in some circumstances to the indirect dealer.\nFor customers who choose to lease a device previously sold to the indirect dealer, T-Mobile will repurchase the device from the indirect dealer and originate a lease directly with the end customer. Repurchase activity from the indirect dealer is estimated and treated as a right of return, reducing equipment revenue at the time of sale to the indirect dealer. Upon lease to the end customer, T-Mobile recognizes lease revenue over the associated lease term within Equipment revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nBy December 31, 2020, we had terminated or restructured most of our arrangements with Brightstar, except for reverse logistics and trade-in services.\nLeases (effective January 1, 2019)\nCell Site, Retail Store and Office Facility Leases\nWe are a lessee for non-cancelable operating and financing leases for cell sites, switch sites, retail stores, network equipment and office facilities with contractual terms that generally extend through 2035. Additionally, we lease dark fiber through non-cancelable operating leases with contractual terms that generally extend through 2041. The majority of cell site leases have a non-cancelable term of five to 15 years with several renewal options that can extend the lease term from five to 35 years. Some of these leases have escalating rentals during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal periods. We recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for operating leases based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments. The right-of-use asset for an operating lease is based on the lease liability. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably certain.\nIn addition, we have financing leases for certain network equipment that generally have a non-cancelable lease term of two to five years. The financing leases do not have renewal options and contain a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease. We recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for financing leases based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments. The right-of-use asset for a finance lease is based on the lease liability. Lease expense for our financing leases is comprised of the amortization of the right-of-use asset and interest expense recognized based on the effective interest method.\nWe consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably certain of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our nationwide network, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. We have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend or terminate our leases. Therefore, as of the lease commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nIn determining the discount rate used to measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability, we use rates implicit in the lease, or if not readily available, we use our incremental borrowing rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on an estimated secured\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nrate comprised of a risk-free LIBOR rate plus a credit spread as secured by our assets. Determining a credit spread as secured by our assets may require significant judgment.\nCertain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on changes in the consumer price index (\u201cCPI\u201d). Lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the CPI; instead, changes in the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. These payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nGenerally, we elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components in arrangements where we are the lessee. For arrangements in which we are the lessor of wireless devices, we did not elect this practical expedient. We did not elect the short-term lease recognition exemption; as such, leases with terms shorter than 12-months are included as a right-of-use asset and lease liability.\nRental revenues and expenses associated with co-location tower sites are presented on a net basis under Topic 842. These revenues and expenses were presented on a gross basis under Topic 840. See Note 17 - Leases for further information.\nSee Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for additional discussion regarding the accounting policies that governed leases prior to January 1, 2019.\nCell Tower Monetization Transactions\nIn 2012, we entered into a prepaid master lease in which we as the lessor provided the rights to utilize tower sites and we leased back space on certain of those towers. Prior to the Merger, Sprint entered into a similar lease-out and leaseback arrangement which we assumed in the Merger.\nThese arrangements are treated as failed sale leasebacks in which the proceeds received are reported as a financing obligation. The principal payments on the tower obligations are included in Other, net within Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our historical tower site asset costs are reported in Property and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are depreciated. See Note 9 - Tower Obligations for further information.\nSprint Retirement Pension Plan\nThrough the Merger, we acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities associated with the Sprint Retirement Pension Plan (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d), which is a defined benefit pension plan providing postretirement benefits to certain employees. As of December 31, 2005, the Pension Plan was amended to freeze benefit plan accruals for participants.\nThe investments in the Pension Plan are measured at fair value on a recurring basis each quarter using quoted market prices or the net asset value per share as a practical expedient. The projected benefit obligations associated with the Pension Plan are determined based on actuarial models utilizing mortality tables and discount rates applied to the expected benefit term. See Note 11 - Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans for further information on the Pension Plan.\nAdvertising Expense\nWe expense the cost of advertising and other promotional expenditures to market our services and products as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, advertising expenses included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income were $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nassess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) consists of adjustments, net of tax, related to unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, available-for-sale securities, foreign currency translation and pension and other postretirement benefits. This is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity until realized in earnings.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and performance-based restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d), is measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of expected forfeitures, over the related service period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. RSUs are recognized as expense using the straight-line method. PRSUs are recognized as expense following a graded vesting schedule with their performance re-assessed and updated on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as changes in facts and circumstances warrant.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing Net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of outstanding stock options, RSUs and PRSUs, calculated using the treasury stock method. See Note 16 - Earnings Per Share for further information.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is a special purpose entity (\u201cSPE\u201d). SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPEs\u2019 assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets, these SPEs are commonly referred to as being bankruptcy remote.\nThe primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party which has both the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could potentially be significant to the VIE. We consolidate VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary or when the VIE cannot be deconsolidated. See Note 4 - Sales of Certain Receivables and Note 9 - Tower Obligations for further information.\nIn assessing which party is the primary beneficiary, all the facts and circumstances are considered, including each party\u2019s role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers and servicers) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.\nDevice Purchases Cash Flow Presentation\nWe classify all device purchases, whether acquired for sale or lease, as operating cash outflows as our predominant strategy is to sell devices to customers rather than lease them. See Note 20 - Additional Financial Information for disclosures of Leased devices transferred from inventory to property and equipment and Returned leased devices transferred from property and equipment to inventory.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current Year\nReceivables and Expected Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d and has since modified the standard with several ASUs (collectively, the \u201cnew credit loss standard\u201d). The new credit loss standard requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The new credit loss standard became effective for us, and we adopted the standard, on January 1, 2020. The new credit loss standard required a cumulative-effect adjustment to Accumulated deficit at the date of initial application, and as a result, we did not restate prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nUnder the new credit loss standard, we recognize lifetime expected credit losses at the inception of our credit risk exposures, whereas we previously recognized credit losses only when it was probable that they had been incurred. We also recognize expected credit losses on our EIP receivables, which are inclusive of all installment receivables acquired in the Merger or issued thereafter, separately from, and in addition to, any unamortized discount on those receivables. Prior to the adoption of the new credit loss standard, we had offset our estimate of probable losses on our EIP receivables by the amount of the related unamortized discounts on those receivables. We have developed an expected credit loss model incorporating forward-looking loss indicators. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new credit loss standard on our receivables portfolio on January 1, 2020 was an increase to our allowance for credit losses of $91 million, a decrease to our net deferred tax liabilities of $24 million and an increase to our Accumulated deficit of $67 million.\nFor EIP receivables acquired in the Merger, we also recognize expected credit losses separately from, and in addition to, the acquisition date fair value of the acquired EIP receivables.\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Topic 350): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract.\u201d The standard aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard also requires the presentation of the amortization of the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as the fees associated with the hosting arrangement. The standard became effective for us, and we adopted the standard, on January 1, 2020. We adopted the standard on a prospective basis applying it to implementation costs incurred subsequent to January 1, 2020 and, as a result, did not restate the prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d The standard removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. We early adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and have applied the standard retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nOn March 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities, as well as for affiliates whose securities collateralize a registrant\u2019s securities. The amendments revise Rules 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X, and relocate part of Rule 3-10 and all of Rule 3-16 to the new Article 13 in Regulation S-X, which is comprised of new Rules 13-01 and 13-02. We early adopted the requirements of the amendments on January 1, 2020, which included replacing guarantor condensed consolidating financial information with summarized financial information for the consolidated obligor group (Parent, Issuer, and Guarantor Subsidiaries) and no longer requiring guarantor cash flow information, financial information for non-guarantor subsidiaries, or a reconciliation to the consolidated results.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nRegulation S-K Modernization Amendments\nOn August 26, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to modernize the description of business (Item 101), legal proceedings (Item 103), and risk factor disclosures (Item 105) that registrants are required to make pursuant to Regulation S-K. The amendments are intended to elicit improved disclosures for investors and add efficiencies to the compliance efforts of registrants. The amendments are also intended to improve the readability of disclosure documents, as well as discourage repetition and reduce the disclosure of unnecessary information. The amendments became effective for us, and we adopted the amendments on November 9, 2020, which included making certain updates to our description of business and risk factor disclosures within our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nReference Rate Reform\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\u201d The standard provides temporary optional expedients and allows for certain exceptions to applying existing GAAP for contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. The standard is available for adoption for a limited time through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have, including optional expedients, on our consolidated financial statements.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data and Supplementary Information Amendments\nOn January 11, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to eliminate the requirement for Selected Financial Data, streamline the requirement to disclose Supplementary Financial Information and amend Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d). These amendments are intended to eliminate duplicative disclosures and modernize and enhance MD&A for the benefit of investors, while simplifying compliance efforts for registrants. The amendments became effective on February 10, 2021. We are currently evaluating the impact these amendments will have on our consolidated financial statements. We will apply the amendments, as applicable, to relevant filings made with the SEC subsequent to this Form 10-K.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not have, or are not expected to have, a significant impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2 - Business Combination\nBusiness Combination Agreement and Amendments\nOn April 29, 2018, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement for the Merger. The Business Combination Agreement was subsequently amended to provide that, following the closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (collectively, the \u201cTransactions\u201d), SoftBank Group Corp. (\u201cSoftBank\u201d) would indemnify us against certain specified matters and the loss of value arising out of, or resulting from, cessation of access to spectrum under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations and qualifications.\nOn February 20, 2020, T-Mobile, SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom AG (\u201cDT\u201d) entered into a letter agreement (the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, SoftBank agreed to cause its applicable affiliates to surrender to T-Mobile, for no additional consideration, an aggregate of 48,751,557 shares of T-Mobile common stock (such number of shares, the \u201cSoftBank Specified Shares Amount\u201d), effective immediately following the Effective Time (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), making SoftBank\u2019s exchange ratio 11.31 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock. This resulted in an effective exchange ratio of approximately 11.00 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock immediately following the closing of the Merger, an increase from the originally agreed 9.75 shares. Sprint stockholders other than SoftBank received the original fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile common stock for each share of Sprint common stock, or the equivalent of approximately 9.75 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock.\nThe Letter Agreement requires T-Mobile to issue to SoftBank 48,751,557 shares of T-Mobile common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Letter Agreement, for no additional consideration, if certain conditions are met. The\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nissuance of these shares is contingent on the trailing 45-day volume-weighted average price per share of T-Mobile common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market being equal to or greater than $150.00, at any time during the period commencing on April 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2025. If the threshold price is not met, then none of the SoftBank Specified Shares Amount will be issued.\nClosing of Sprint Merger\nOn April 1, 2020, we completed the Merger, and as a result, Sprint and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of T-Mobile. Sprint was the fourth-largest telecommunications company in the U.S. offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communication products and services. As a combined company, we expect to be able to rapidly launch a broad and deep nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations. We combined the Sprint and T-Mobile operations under the T-Mobile brand nationwide on August 2, 2020.\nUpon completion of the Merger, each share of Sprint common stock was exchanged for 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile common stock, or 9.75 shares of Sprint common stock for each share of T-Mobile common stock. After adjustments, including the holdback of the SoftBank Specified Shares Amount and fractional shares, we issued 373,396,310 shares of T-Mobile common stock to Sprint stockholders. The fair value of the T-Mobile common stock provided in exchange for Sprint common stock was approximately $31.3 billion.\nAdditional components of consideration included the repayment of certain of Sprint\u2019s debt, replacement equity awards attributable to pre-combination services, contingent consideration and a cash payment received for certain reimbursed Merger expenses.\nImmediately following the closing of the Merger and the surrender of the SoftBank Specified Shares Amount, pursuant to the Letter Agreement described above, DT and SoftBank held, directly or indirectly, approximately 43.6% and 24.7%, respectively, of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 31.7% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock held by other stockholders.\nConsideration Transferred\nThe acquisition-date fair value of consideration transferred in the Merger totaled $40.8 billion, comprised of the following:\n(1) Represents the fair value of T-Mobile common stock issued to Sprint stockholders pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, less shares surrendered by SoftBank pursuant to the Letter Agreement. The fair value is based on 373,396,310 shares of Sprint common stock issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2020, an exchange ratio of 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile common stock per share of Sprint common stock, less 48,751,557 T-Mobile shares surrendered by SoftBank which are treated as contingent consideration, and the closing price per share of T-Mobile common stock on NASDAQ on March 31, 2020, of $83.90, as shares were transferred to Sprint stockholders prior to the opening of markets on April 1, 2020.\n(2) Equity-based awards held by Sprint employees prior to the acquisition date have been replaced with T-Mobile equity-based awards. The portion of the equity-based awards that relates to services performed by the employee prior to the acquisition date is included within consideration transferred, and includes stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units.\n(3) Represents the cash consideration paid concurrent with the close of the Merger to retire certain Sprint debt, as required by change in control provisions of the debt, plus interest and prepayment penalties.\n(4) Represents the fair value of the SoftBank Specified Shares Amount contingent consideration that may be issued as set forth in the Letter Agreement.\n(5) Represents receipt of a cash payment from SoftBank for certain expenses associated with the Merger and is presented in Cash paid for acquisition of companies, net of cash acquired within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe SoftBank Specified Shares Amount was determined to be contingent consideration with an acquisition-date fair value of $1.9 billion. We estimated the fair value using the income approach, a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, whereby a Monte Carlo simulation method estimated the probability of different outcomes as the likelihood of achieving the 45-day volume-weighted average price threshold is not easily predicted. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and, therefore, represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The key\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nassumptions in applying the income approach include estimated future share-price volatility, which was based on historical market trends and estimated future performance of T-Mobile.\nThe maximum amount of contingent consideration that could be issued to SoftBank has an estimated value of $7.3 billion, based on SoftBank Specified Shares Amount of 48,751,557 multiplied by the defined volume-weighted average price per share of $150.00. The contingent consideration that could be delivered to SoftBank is classified within equity and is not subject to remeasurement.\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\nWe accounted for the Merger as a business combination. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Sprint were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and consolidated with those of T-Mobile. Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires the use of significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. For the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we used the cost, income and market approaches, including market participant assumptions.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values for each major class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. We retained the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete except for the finalization of certain aspects of spectrum valuation, the valuation of certain income tax matters and loss contingencies.\n(1) Included in Other assets acquired is $80 million in restricted cash.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nAmounts previously disclosed for the estimated values of certain acquired assets and liabilities assumed have been revised based on additional information arising subsequent to the initial valuation.\nSignificant Measurement Period Adjustments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the date of the Merger. These adjustments included:\n\u2022An increase of $1.2 billion in Property and equipment related to the finalization of valuations related to certain tower assets and an increase of $1.7 billion in Other long-term liabilities associated with contract terms that are unfavorable to market terms. See Note 9 - Tower Obligations for further information; and\n\u2022A decrease of $690 million in Deferred tax liabilities resulting from a $357 million reclassification from deferred tax liabilities to current liabilities and the continued assessment of valuation allowance necessary as of the date of the Merger along with tax effecting measurement period adjustments. See Note 13 - Income Taxes for further information.\nThe measurement period adjustments did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net impact of the measurement period adjustments resulted in a net increase to goodwill.\nIntangible Assets and Liabilities\nGoodwill with a provisionally assigned value of $9.4 billion represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary goodwill recognized includes synergies expected to be achieved from the operations of the combined company, the assembled workforce of Sprint and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Expected synergies include the cost savings from the planned integration of network infrastructure, facilities, personnel and systems. None of the goodwill resulting from the Merger is deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill acquired is allocated to the wireless reporting unit.\nOther intangible assets include $4.9 billion of customer relationships with a weighted-average useful life of eight years and tradenames of $207 million with a useful life of two years. Leased spectrum arrangements that have favorable (asset) and unfavorable (liability) terms compared to current market rates were assigned preliminary fair values of $790 million and $197 million, respectively, with 18 year and 19 year weighted average useful lives, respectively.\nThe preliminary fair value of Spectrum licenses of $45.4 billion was estimated using the income approach, specifically a Greenfield model. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and, therefore, represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The key assumptions in applying the income approach include the discount rate, market share, estimated capital and operating expenditures, forecasted service revenue and long-term growth rate for a hypothetical market participant that enters the wireless industry and builds a nationwide wireless network.\nAcquired Receivables\nThe fair value of the assets acquired include Accounts receivable of $1.8 billion and EIP receivables of $1.3 billion. The unpaid principal balance under these contracts as of the Merger date was $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. The difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance primarily represents amounts expected to be uncollectible.\nIndemnification Assets and Contingent Liabilities\nPursuant to Amendment No 2. to the Business Combination Agreement, SoftBank agreed to indemnify us against certain specified matters and losses. As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a contingent liability and an offsetting indemnification asset for the expected reimbursement by SoftBank for certain Lifeline matters that have not been resolved. The liability is presented in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and the indemnification asset is presented in Other current assets within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In November 2020, we entered into a consent decree with the FCC to resolve certain Lifeline matters, which resulted in a payment of $200 million by SoftBank. We expect that any additional liabilities related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by SoftBank.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nTransaction Costs\nWe recognized transaction costs of $201 million, $106 million and $71 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs were associated with legal and professional services and were recognized as Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nPro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information gives effect to the Transactions as if they had been completed on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma information was prepared in accordance with the requirements of ASC 805, which is a different basis than pro forma information prepared under Article 11 of Regulation S-X (\u201cArticle 11\u201d). As such, they are not directly comparable with historical results for stand-alone T-Mobile prior to April 1, 2020, historical results for T-Mobile from April 1, 2020 that reflect the Transactions and are inclusive of the results and operations of Sprint, nor our previously provided pro forma financials prepared in accordance with Article 11. The pro forma results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include the impact of several adjustments to previously reported operating results. The pro forma adjustments are based on historically reported transactions by the respective companies. The pro forma results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisition.\nSignificant nonrecurring pro forma adjustments include:\n\u2022Transaction costs of $559 million are assumed to have occurred on January 1, 2019, and are recognized as if incurred in the first quarter of 2019;\n\u2022The Prepaid Business divested on July 1, 2020, is assumed to have been classified as discontinued operations as of January 1, 2019, and the related activities are presented in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax;\n\u2022Permanent financing issued and debt redemptions occurring in connection with the closing of the Merger are assumed to have occurred on January 1, 2019, and historical interest expense associated with repaid borrowings is removed;\n\u2022Tangible and intangible assets are assumed to be recorded at their estimated fair values as of the pro forma close date of January 1, 2019 and are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives; and\n\u2022Accounting policies of Sprint are conformed to those of T-Mobile including depreciation for leased devices, Brightstar distribution, amortization of costs to acquire a contract and certain tower lease transactions as described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9 - Tower Obligations.\nThe selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on January 1, 2019, nor do they purport to project the future consolidated results of operations.\nFor the periods subsequent to the Merger close date, the acquired Sprint subsidiaries contributed total revenues and operating income of $20.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, that were included in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nFinancing\nIn connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, T-Mobile USA, Inc. (\u201cT-Mobile USA\u201d) entered into a commitment letter, dated as of April 29, 2018 (as amended and restated on May 15, 2018 and on September 6, 2019, the \u201cCommitment Letter\u201d). On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we drew down on our $19.0 billion New Secured Bridge Loan Facility and our $4.0 billion New Secured Term Loan Facility (each as defined below). We used the net proceeds from the drawdown of the secured facilities to refinance certain existing debt of us, Sprint and our and Sprint\u2019s respective subsidiaries and for post-closing general corporate purposes of the combined company. See Note 8 - Debt for further information.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn connection with the financing provided for in the Commitment Letter, we incurred certain fees payable to the financial institutions. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we paid $355 million in Commitment Letter fees to certain financial institutions. See Note 8 - Debt for further information.\nIn connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, DT and T-Mobile USA entered into a Financing Matters Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2018 (the \u201cFinancing Matters Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which DT agreed, among other things, to consent to, subject to certain conditions, amendments to certain existing debt owed to DT, in connection with the Merger. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we made a payment for requisite consents to DT of $13 million. See Note 8 - Debt for further information.\nOn May 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the Consent Solicitation Statement dated as of May 14, 2018 (the \u201cConsent Solicitation Statement\u201d), we obtained consents necessary to effect amendments to certain existing debt of us and our subsidiaries. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we made payments for requisite consents to third-party note holders of $95 million. See Note 8 - Debt for further information.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Transactions were the subject of various legal and regulatory proceedings involving a number of state and federal agencies. In connection with those proceedings and the approval of the Transactions, we have certain commitments and other obligations to various state and federal agencies and certain nongovernmental organizations. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies for further information.\nPrepaid Transaction\nOn July 26, 2019, we entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with Sprint and DISH, pursuant to which, following the consummation of the Merger, DISH would acquire the Prepaid Business.\nOn June 17, 2020, T-Mobile, Sprint and DISH entered into the First Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment of the Asset Purchase Agreement, T-Mobile, Sprint and DISH agreed to proceed with the closing of the Prepaid Transaction in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement on July 1, 2020, subject to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Consent Decree.\nOn July 1, 2020, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we completed the Prepaid Transaction. Upon closing of the Prepaid Transaction, we received $1.4 billion from DISH for the Prepaid Business, subject to working capital adjustments. See Note 12 - Discontinued Operations for further information.\nShenandoah Personal Communications Company Affiliate Relationship\nSprint PCS (specifically Sprint Spectrum L.P.) is party to a variety of publicly filed agreements with Shenandoah Personal Communications Company LLC (\u201cShentel\u201d), pursuant to which Shentel is the exclusive provider of Sprint PCS\u2019s wireless mobility communications network products in certain parts of Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Pursuant to one such agreement, the Sprint PCS Management Agreement, dated November 5, 1999 (as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time, the \u201cManagement Agreement\u201d), Sprint PCS was granted an option to purchase Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunications assets used to provide services pursuant to the Management Agreement. On August 26, 2020, Sprint, now our direct subsidiary, on behalf of and as the direct or indirect owner of Sprint PCS, exercised its option by delivering a binding notice of exercise to Shentel. The exercise of this option triggered a requirement for the parties to engage three independent valuation providers (the \u201cValuation Providers\u201d) to calculate the \u201centire business value\u201d (the \u201cEntire Business Value\u201d) of such wireless telecommunications assets, pursuant to a formula and valuation process prescribed in the Management Agreement.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on February 1, 2021, in accordance with the Management Agreement and other agreed-upon terms, the Valuation Providers determined and calculated the Entire Business Value of Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunication assets used to provide services pursuant to the Management Agreement to be $2.1 billion, and correspondingly, the base purchase price for such wireless telecommunication assets shall be ninety percent (90%) of that Entire Business Value amount ($1.9 billion), subject to certain other purchase price adjustments prescribed by the Management Agreement and such additional purchase price adjustments agreed by the parties. The parties are negotiating the remaining outstanding terms of a definitive agreement to govern the purchase of Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunication assets and expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021 after satisfying customary conditions to closing.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 3 - Receivables and Expected Credit Losses\nOur portfolio of receivables is comprised of two portfolio segments: accounts receivable and EIP receivables.\nAccounts Receivable Portfolio Segment\nOur accounts receivable segment primarily consists of amounts currently due from customers, including service and leased device receivables, device insurance administrators, wholesale partners, third-party retail channels and other carriers.\nWe estimate expected credit losses associated with our accounts receivable portfolio using an aging schedule methodology that utilizes historical information and current conditions to develop expected credit losses by aging bucket, including for receivables that are not past due.\nTo determine the appropriate credit loss percentages by aging bucket, we consider a number of factors, including our overall historical credit losses, net of recoveries and timely payment experience as well as current collection trends such as write-off frequency and severity, credit quality of the customer base, and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions, including the expected economic impacts of the Pandemic.\nWe consider the need to adjust our estimate of expected credit losses for reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. To do so, we monitor professional forecasts of changes in real U.S. gross domestic product and forecasts of consumer credit behavior for comparable credit exposures. We also periodically evaluate other economic indicators such as unemployment rates to assess their level of correlation with our historical credit loss statistics.\nEIP Receivables Portfolio Segment\nBased upon customer credit profiles at the time of customer origination, we classify the EIP receivables segment into two customer classes of \u201cPrime\u201d and \u201cSubprime.\u201d Prime customer receivables are those with lower credit risk and Subprime customer receivables are those with higher credit risk. Customers may be required to make a down payment on their equipment purchases. In addition, certain customers within the Subprime category are required to pay an advance deposit.\nTo determine a customer\u2019s credit profile, we use a proprietary credit scoring model that measures the credit quality of a customer using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores and service and device plan characteristics.\nInstallment loans acquired in the Merger are included in EIP receivables. We applied our proprietary credit scoring model to the customers acquired in the Merger with an outstanding EIP receivable balance. Based on tenure, consumer credit risk score and credit profile, these acquired customers were classified into our customer classes of Prime or Subprime. Our proprietary credit scoring model is applied to all EIP arrangements originated after the Merger close date.\nThe following table summarizes the EIP receivables, including imputed discounts and related allowance for credit losses:\n(1) Through the Merger, we acquired EIP receivables with a fair value of $1.3 billion as of April 1, 2020. As they were recorded at fair value, an imputed discount was not recognized on the acquired receivables.\n(2) Allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 was impacted by the cumulative effect of initially applying the new credit loss standard on our receivables portfolio on January 1, 2020, which resulted in an increase to our allowance for credit losses of $91 million.\nWe manage our EIP receivables portfolio using delinquency and customer credit class as key credit quality indicators. As a part of the adoption of the new credit loss standard, we now disclose our EIP receivables portfolio disaggregated by origination year. EIP receivables acquired through the Merger are also presented by origination year. The following table presents the\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\namortized cost of our EIP receivables by delinquency status, customer credit class, and year of origination as of December 31, 2020.\nWe estimate expected credit losses on our EIP receivables by using historical data adjusted for current conditions to calculate default probabilities for our outstanding EIP loans. We consider various risk characteristics when calculating default probabilities, such as how long such loans have been outstanding, customer credit ratings, customer tenure, delinquency status and other correlated variables identified through statistical analyses. We multiply these estimated default probabilities by our estimated loss given default, which considers recoveries.\nAs we do for our accounts receivable portfolio segment, we consider the need to adjust our estimate of expected losses on EIP receivables for reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions through monitoring of external professional forecasts and periodic internal statistical analyses, including the expected economic impacts of the Pandemic.\nFor EIP receivables acquired in the Merger, the difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan at the\nacquisition date is accreted to interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. EIP receivables had a combined weighted average effective interest rate of 6.7% and 8.8% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nActivity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 in the allowance for credit losses and unamortized imputed discount balances for the accounts receivable and EIP receivables segments were as follows:\nOff-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures\nWe do not have material, unmitigated off-balance-sheet credit exposures as of December 31, 2020. In connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates and credit worthiness, dilutions and recoveries. See Note 4 - Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.\nNote 4 - Sales of Certain Receivables\nWe have entered into transactions to sell certain service accounts receivable and EIP receivables. The transactions, including our continuing involvement with the sold receivables and the respective impacts to our consolidated financial statements, are described below.\nIn conjunction with the Merger, the total principal amount outstanding under Sprint\u2019s accounts receivable facility of $2.3 billion was repaid on April 1, 2020, and the facility was terminated.\nSales of Service Accounts Receivable\nOverview of the Transaction\nIn 2014, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis (the \u201cservice receivable sale arrangement\u201d). The maximum funding commitment of the service receivable sale arrangement is $950 million, and the facility expires in March 2021. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the service receivable sale arrangement provided funding of $772 million and $924 million, respectively. Sales of receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis. The receivables consist of service charges currently due from customers and are short-term in nature.\nIn connection with the service receivable sale arrangement, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity, to sell service accounts receivable (the \u201cService BRE\u201d). The Service BRE does not qualify as a VIE, and due to the significant level of control we exercise over the entity, it is consolidated. Pursuant to the service receivable sale arrangement, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries transfer selected receivables to the Service BRE. The Service BRE then sells the receivables to an unaffiliated entity (the \u201cService VIE\u201d), which was established to facilitate the sale of beneficial ownership interests in the receivables to certain third parties.\nVariable Interest Entity\nWe determined that the Service VIE qualifies as a VIE as it lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities. We have a variable interest in the Service VIE but are not the primary beneficiary as we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Service VIE\u2019s economic performance. Those activities include committing the Service VIE to legal agreements to purchase or sell assets, selecting which receivables are purchased in the service receivable sale arrangement, determining whether the Service VIE will sell interests in the purchased service receivables to other parties, funding of the entity and servicing of receivables. We do not hold the power to direct the key decisions underlying these activities. For example, while we act as the servicer of the sold receivables, which is considered a significant activity of the Service VIE, we are acting as an agent in our capacity as the servicer, and the counterparty to the service receivable sale arrangement has the ability to remove us as the servicing agent of the receivables at will with no recourse available to us. As we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary, the balances and results of the Service VIE are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consist primarily of the deferred purchase price, and liabilities included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to our variable interest in the Service VIE:\nSales of EIP Receivables\nOverview of the Transaction\nIn 2015, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis (the \u201cEIP sale arrangement\u201d). The maximum funding commitment of the sale arrangement is $1.3 billion. In February 2020, we amended the\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nsale arrangement to provide for an alternative advance rate methodology for the EIP accounts receivable sold in the sale arrangement and to make certain other administrative changes. On November 2, 2020, we extended the scheduled expiration date of the EIP sale arrangement to November 18, 2021.\nOn April 30, 2020, we agreed with the purchaser banks to update our collection policies to temporarily allow for flexibility for modifications to the accounts receivable sold that are impacted by COVID-19 and exclusion of such accounts receivable from all pool performance triggers.\nAs of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the EIP sale arrangement provided funding of $1.3 billion. Sales of EIP receivables occur daily and are settled on a monthly basis.\nIn connection with this EIP sale arrangement, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, which qualifies as a bankruptcy remote entity (the \u201cEIP BRE\u201d). Pursuant to the EIP sale arrangement, our wholly owned subsidiary transfers selected receivables to the EIP BRE. The EIP BRE then sells the receivables to a non-consolidated and unaffiliated third-party entity over which we do not exercise any level of control, nor does the third-party entity qualify as a VIE.\nVariable Interest Entity\nWe determined that the EIP BRE is a VIE as its equity investment at risk lacks the obligation to absorb a certain portion of its expected losses. We have a variable interest in the EIP BRE and have determined that we are the primary beneficiary based on our ability to direct the activities which most significantly impact the EIP BRE\u2019s economic performance. Those activities include selecting which receivables are transferred into the EIP BRE and sold in the EIP sale arrangement and funding of the EIP BRE. Additionally, our equity interest in the EIP BRE obligates us to absorb losses and gives us the right to receive benefits from the EIP BRE that could potentially be significant to the EIP BRE. Accordingly, we include the balances and results of operations of the EIP BRE in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amounts and classification of assets, which consist primarily of the deferred purchase price, and liabilities included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets of the EIP BRE:\nIn addition, the EIP BRE is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, prior to any liquidation of the EIP BRE, to be satisfied prior to any value in the EIP BRE becoming available to us. Accordingly, the assets of the EIP BRE may not be used to settle our general obligations and creditors of the EIP BRE have limited recourse to our general credit.\nSales of Receivables\nThe transfers of service receivables and EIP receivables to the non-consolidated entities are accounted for as sales of financial assets. Once identified for sale, the receivable is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Upon sale, we derecognize the net carrying amount of the receivables.\nWe recognize the cash proceeds received upon sale in Net cash provided by operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We recognize proceeds net of the deferred purchase price, consisting of a receivable from the purchasers that entitles us to certain collections on the receivables. We recognize the collection of the deferred purchase price in Net cash used in investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions.\nThe deferred purchase price represents a financial asset that is primarily tied to the creditworthiness of the customers and which can be settled in such a way that we may not recover substantially all of our recorded investment, due to default by the customers on the underlying receivables. At inception, we elected to measure the deferred purchase price at fair value with changes in fair value included in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The fair value of the deferred purchase price is determined based on a discounted cash flow model which uses primarily unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), including customer default rates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ndeferred purchase price related to the sales of service receivables and EIP receivables was $884 million and $781 million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of the sale of certain service receivables and EIP receivables in our Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nWe recognized losses from sales of receivables, including adjustments to the receivables\u2019 fair values and changes in fair value of the deferred purchase price, of $36 million, $130 million and $157 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nContinuing Involvement\nPursuant to the sale arrangements described above, we have continuing involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables we sell as we service the receivables and are required to repurchase certain receivables, including ineligible receivables, aged receivables and receivables where write-off is imminent. We continue to service the customers and their related receivables, including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. As the receivables are sold on a revolving basis, the customer payment collections on sold receivables may be reinvested in new receivable sales. At the direction of the purchasers of the sold receivables, we apply the same policies and procedures while servicing the sold receivables as we apply to our owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with our customers. Pursuant to the EIP sale arrangement, under certain circumstances, we are required to deposit cash or replacement EIP receivables primarily for contracts terminated by customers under our JUMP! On Demand program.\nIn addition, we have continuing involvement with the sold receivables as we may be responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the sale arrangements. Our maximum exposure to loss related to the involvement with the service receivables and EIP receivables sold under the sale arrangements was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. The maximum exposure to loss, which is a required disclosure under U.S. GAAP, represents an estimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances whereby we would not receive the deferred purchase price portion of the contractual proceeds withheld by the purchasers and would also be required to repurchase the maximum amount of receivables pursuant to the sale arrangements without consideration for any recovery. We believe the probability of these circumstances occurring is remote and the maximum exposure to loss is not an indication of our expected loss.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 5 - Property and Equipment\nThe components of property and equipment were as follows:\nTotal depreciation expense relating to property and equipment and financing lease right-of-use assets was $13.1 billion, $6.5 billion and $6.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts include depreciation expense related to leased wireless devices of $3.1 billion, $543 million and $940 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment and spectrum intangible assets. We recognized capitalized interest of $440 million, $473 million and $362 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAsset retirement obligations are primarily for certain legal obligations to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative assets are located.\nActivity in our asset retirement obligations was as follows:\nThe corresponding assets, net of accumulated depreciation, related to asset retirement obligations were $912 million and $159 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPostpaid Billing System Impairment\nIn connection with the continuing integration of the businesses following the Merger, we evaluated the long-term billing system architecture strategy for our postpaid customers. In order to facilitate customer migration from the Sprint legacy billing platform, our postpaid billing system replacement plan and associated development will no longer serve our future needs. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment of $200 million related to capitalized software development costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, all of which relates to the impairment recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2020. The expense is included within Impairment expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. There were no impairments recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:\nOn April 1, 2020, we completed our Merger with Sprint, which was accounted for as a business combination resulting in $9.4 billion in goodwill. The acquired goodwill was allocated to the wireless reporting unit and will be tested for impairment at this level. See Note 2 - Business Combination for further information.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nCertain non-financial assets, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets such as Spectrum licenses, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, these assets are required to be assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The nonrecurring measurements of the fair value of these assets, for which observable market information may be limited, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In the event an impairment is required, the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value using market-based assumptions, to the extent they are available, as well as other assumptions that may require significant judgement.\nFor our assessment of the wireless reporting unit we employed a qualitative approach. The fair value of the wireless reporting unit is estimated using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. No events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit may be below its carrying amount at December 31, 2020.\nOur enhanced in-home broadband opportunity following the Merger, along with the acquisition of certain content rights, has created a strategic shift in our TVisionTM services offering, allowing us the ability to develop a video product that will be complementary to the in-home broadband offering. As a result of the change in the stand-alone product offering plans and timing, we completed an interim goodwill impairment analysis for the Layer3 reporting unit and recognized a goodwill impairment of $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, all of which relates to the impairment recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2020. This impairment reduced the goodwill assigned to the Layer3 reporting unit to zero. The expense is included within Impairment expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. There were no goodwill impairments recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit. We employed an income approach to assess the fair value of the Layer3 reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital and tax rates. We also made certain forecasts about future business strategies and economic conditions, market data, and other assumptions, such as estimates of subscribers for TVisionTM services, average revenue and content cost per subscriber. The discount rate used was based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business\u2019s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. As of December 31, 2020, Goodwill was only assigned to the wireless reporting unit as the Goodwill assigned to the Layer3 reporting unit was written-off to a zero balance during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nIntangible Assets\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets Acquired\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in the Merger:\n(1) Tradenames include the Sprint brand\nSpectrum licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, typically up to 15 years; however, the FCC has granted license renewals routinely and at a nominal cost. The spectrum licenses acquired expire at various dates and we believe we will be able to meet all requirements necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum licenses at a nominal cost. Moreover, we determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our spectrum licenses. Therefore, we determined the spectrum licenses should be treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of spectrum licenses includes the value associated with aggregating a nationwide portfolio of owned and leased spectrum.\nFavorable spectrum leases represent a lease contract where the market rate is higher than the future contractual lease payments. We lease this spectrum from third parties who hold the spectrum licenses. As these contracts pertain to intangible assets, they are excluded from the lease accounting guidance (ASC 842) and are accounted for as service contracts in which the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease team. Favorable spectrum leases of $790 million were recorded as an intangible asset as a result of purchase accounting and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the associated remaining lease term. Additionally, we recognized unfavorable spectrum lease liabilities of $197 million, which are also amortized over their respective remaining lease terms and are included in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe customer relationship intangible assets represent the value associated with the acquired Sprint customers. The customer relationship intangible assets are amortized using the sum-of-the-years digits method over periods of up to eight years.\nOther intangible assets are amortized over the remaining period that the asset is expected to provide benefit to us.\nSpectrum Licenses\nThe following table summarizes our spectrum license activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nSpectrum Transactions\nIn March 2020, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder of 2,384 licenses in Auction 103 (37/39 GHz and 47 GHz spectrum bands) for an aggregate price of $873 million, net of an incentive payment of $59 million. At the inception of Auction 103 in October 2019, we deposited $82 million with the FCC. Upon conclusion of Auction 103 in March 2020, we made a down payment of $93 million for the purchase price of the licenses won in the auction. On April 8, 2020, we paid the FCC the remaining $698 million of the purchase price for the licenses won in the auction. Prior to the Merger, the FCC announced that Sprint was the winning bidder of 127 licenses in Auction 103 (37/39 GHz and 47 GHz spectrum bands). All payments related to the licenses won were made by Sprint prior to the Merger.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn November 2020, we executed an agreement with a third party for the exchange of certain AWS spectrum licenses. Upon the execution of the agreement, the spectrum licenses were classified as assets held for sale, included within Other current assets, and measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash impairment loss of $35 million, included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We received approval for the transaction from the FCC and the transaction closed in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe licenses are included in Spectrum licenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020. Cash payments to acquire spectrum licenses and payments for costs to clear spectrum are included in Purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits, in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn April 2020, we acquired FCC licenses in the 800 MHz, 1900 MHz, and 2.5 GHz bands as part of the Merger with Sprint at an estimated fair value of approximately $45.4 billion. See Note 2 - Business Combination for further information.\nImpairment assessment\nFor our assessment of Spectrum license impairment, we employed a qualitative approach. No events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate the fair value of the Spectrum licenses may be below its carrying amount at December 31, 2020.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe components of Other intangible assets were as follows:\nAmortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization was $1.2 billion, $82 million and $124 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe estimated aggregate future amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization are summarized below:\nSubstantially all of the estimated future amortization expense is associated with intangible assets acquired in the Merger.\nNote 7 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable, Accounts receivable from affiliates, Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and borrowings under vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nPeriodically, we use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, such as interest rate risk. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship (cash flow hedge) to help minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in cash flows caused by interest rate volatility. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Lock Derivatives\nIn October 2018, we entered into interest rate lock derivatives with notional amounts of $9.6 billion. In November 2019, we extended the mandatory termination date on our interest rate lock derivatives to June 3, 2020. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, we made net collateral transfers to certain of our derivative counterparties totaling $580 million, which included variation margin transfers to (or from) such derivative counterparties based on daily market movements. No amounts were transferred to the derivative counterparties subsequent to March 31, 2020. These collateral transfers are included in Net cash related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements within Net cash used in investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net collateral transfers to certain of our derivative counterparties totaled $632 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and was presented in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. There was no collateral receivable balance as of December 31, 2020.\nWe record interest rate lock derivatives on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value that is derived primarily from observable market data, including yield curves. Interest rate lock derivatives were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Cash flows associated with qualifying hedge derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the item being hedged.\nThe fair value of interest rate lock derivatives was a liability of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, and was included in Other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Aggregate changes in fair value, net of tax, of $1.6 billion and $868 million are presented in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nBetween April 2 to April 6, 2020, in connection with the issuance of an aggregate of $19.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 3.500% to 4.500% and maturing in 2025 through 2050, we terminated our interest rate lock derivatives. See Note 8 - Debt for further information regarding the issuance of Senior Secured Notes. At the time of termination, the interest rate lock derivatives were a liability of $2.3 billion, of which $1.2 billion was cash-collateralized. The cash flows associated with the settlement of interest rate lock derivatives are presented on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, with the total cash payments to settle the swaps of $2.3 billion presented in changes in Other current and long-term liabilities within Net cash provided by operating activities and the return of cash collateral of $1.2 billion presented as an inflow in Net cash related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements within Net cash used in investing activities.\nUpon the issuance of debt to which the hedged interest rate risk related, we began amortizing the Accumulated other comprehensive loss with the derivatives into Interest expense in a manner consistent with how the hedged interest payments affect earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $128 million was amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. No amounts were amortized into Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We expect to amortize $189 million of the Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the derivatives into Interest expense over the next 12 months.\nDeferred Purchase Price Assets\nIn connection with the sales of certain service and EIP accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable Level 3 inputs, including customer default rates. See Note 4 - Sales of Certain Receivables for further information.\nThe carrying amounts of our deferred purchase price assets, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $884 million and $781 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Fair value was equal to carrying amount at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDebt\nThe fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes, Senior Secured Notes, and Secured Term Loan Facility to third parties was determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, and therefore were classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of our Senior Notes to affiliates and Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates were determined\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nbased on a discounted cash flow approach using market interest rates of instruments with similar terms and maturities and an estimate for our standalone credit risk. Accordingly, our Senior Notes to affiliates and Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nAlthough we have determined the estimated fair values using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment was required in interpreting market data to develop fair value estimates for the Senior Notes to affiliates and Incremental Term Loan Facility to affiliates. The fair value estimates were based on information available as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. As such, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amount we could realize in a current market exchange.\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of our short-term and long-term debt included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\n(1) Excludes $240 million and $25 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in vendor financing arrangements and other debt as the carrying values approximate fair value primarily due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\nGuarantee Liabilities\nWe offer device trade-in programs that provide eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. For customers who enroll in these programs, we recognize a liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee, incorporating the expected probability and timing of handset upgrade and the estimated fair value of the handset which is returned. Accordingly, our guarantee liabilities were classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. When customers upgrade their devices, the difference between the EIP balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. Guarantee liabilities are included in Other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe carrying amounts of our guarantee liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $50 million and $62 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe total estimated remaining gross EIP receivable balances of all enrolled handset upgrade program customers, which are the remaining EIP amounts underlying the trade-in right guarantee, including EIP receivables that have been sold, was $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. This is not an indication of our expected loss exposure as it does not consider the expected fair value of the used handset or the probability and timing of the trade-in.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 8 - Debt\nDebt was as follows:\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1)On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we amended the $1.25 billion of 5.125% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2025 and $1.25 billion of 5.375% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2027, to change the maturity date thereof to April 15, 2021 and April 15, 2022, respectively. See \u201cFinancing Matters Agreement\u201d section below for further information.\nOur effective interest rate, excluding the impact of derivatives and capitalized interest, was approximately 4.6% and 5.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on weighted average debt outstanding of $58.4 billion and $25.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted average debt outstanding was calculated by applying an average of the monthly ending balances of total short-term and long-term debt and short-term and long-term debt to affiliates, net of unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs and consent fees.\nIssuances and Borrowings\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued the following Senior Secured Notes and entered into the following Secured loan facilities:\nCredit Facilities\nIn connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, T-Mobile USA entered into the Commitment Letter, with certain financial institutions named therein that committed to provide up to $27.0 billion in secured debt financing through May 1, 2020, including a $4.0 billion secured revolving credit facility, a $4.0 billion secured term loan facility, and a $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility. The funding of the debt facilities provided for in the Commitment Letter was subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein, including consummation of the Merger.\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a Bridge Loan Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions named therein, providing for a $19.0 billion secured bridge loan facility (\u201cNew Secured Bridge Loan Facility\u201d). The New Secured Bridge Loan Facility had an interest rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% and had a maturity date of March 31, 2021.\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a Credit Agreement (the \u201cNew Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain financial institutions named therein, providing for a $4.0 billion secured term loan facility (\u201cNew Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (\u201cNew Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). On September 16, 2020, we increased the aggregate commitment under the New Revolving Credit Facility to $5.5 billion through an amendment (the \u201cIncremental Amendment\u201d) to the New Credit Agreement. The New Secured Term Loan Facility had an interest rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 3.00% and had a maturity\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ndate of April 1, 2027. The New Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% with the margin subject to a reduction to 1.00% if T-Mobile\u2019s Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 0.75 to 1.00. The commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility mature on April 1, 2025. The New Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial maintenance covenant of 3.3x with respect to T-Mobile\u2019s Total First Lien Net Leverage Ratio commencing with the period ending September 30, 2020.\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we drew down on our $19.0 billion New Secured Bridge Loan Facility and our $4.0 billion New Secured Term Loan Facility. We used the net proceeds of $22.6 billion from the drawdown of the secured facilities to repay our $4.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT and to repurchase from DT $4.0 billion of indebtedness to affiliates, consisting of $2.0 billion of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021 and $2.0 billion of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, as well as to redeem certain debt of Sprint and Sprint\u2019s subsidiaries, including the secured term loans due 2024 with a total principal amount outstanding of $5.9 billion, accounts receivable facility with a total amount outstanding of $2.3 billion, and Sprint\u2019s 7.250% Guaranteed Notes due 2028 with a total principal amount outstanding of $1.0 billion, and for post-closing general corporate purposes of the combined company.\nIn connection with the financing provided for in the Commitment Letter, we incurred certain fees payable to the financial institutions, including certain financing fees on the secured term loan commitment and fees for structuring, funding, and providing the commitments. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we paid $355 million in Commitment Letter fees to certain financial institutions.\nOn October 30, 2020, we entered into a $5.0 billion senior secured term loan commitment with certain financial institutions. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 14, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion in Senior Notes. A portion of the senior secured term loan commitment was reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Senior Notes, which reduced the commitment to $2.0 billion. Up to $2.0 billion of loans under the commitment may be drawn at any time (subject to customary conditions precedent) through June 30, 2021. If drawn, the facility matures in 364 days with one six-month extension exercisable at our discretion. Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% per annum.\nSenior Notes\nOn April 9, 2020, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $19.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 3.500% to 4.500% and maturing in 2025 through 2050, and used the net proceeds of $18.8 billion together with cash on hand to repay all of the outstanding amounts under, and terminate, our $19.0 billion New Secured Bridge Loan Facility, as described above.\nOn June 24, 2020, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $4.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 1.500% to 2.550% and maturing in 2026 through 2031. The Senior Secured Notes were issued for refinancing callable Senior Notes and, subsequent to the issuance, we redeemed certain Senior Notes as set forth below under \u201cSenior Secured Notes - Redemptions and Repayments\u201d and \u201cSenior Notes to Affiliates.\u201d\nOn October 6, 2020, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $4.0 billion in Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 2.050% to 3.300% and maturing in 2028 through 2051. On October 9, 2020, we used the net proceeds of $4.0 billion to repay at par all of the outstanding amounts under, and terminate, our New Secured Term Loan Facility.\nOn October 28, 2020, T-Mobile USA and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, issued an aggregate of $4.75 billion in Senior Secured Notes bearing interest rates ranging from 2.250% to 3.600% and maturing in 2031 through 2060. We intend to use the net proceeds of $4.6 billion for general corporate purposes, which may include among other things, acquisitions of additional spectrum and refinancing existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis.\nThe Senior Secured Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with an applicable exemption from the registration requirements thereof. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes were offered and sold only (1) to persons reasonably believed to be \u201cqualified institutional buyers\u201d under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (2) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThe Senior Secured Notes are secured by a first priority security interest, subject to permitted liens, in substantially all of our present and future assets, other than certain excluded assets. They are redeemable at our discretion, in whole or in part, at any\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ntime. If redeemed prior to their contractually specified Par Call Date, the redemption price is subject to a make-whole premium calculated by reference to then-current U.S. Treasury rates plus a fixed spread; if redeemed on or after their respective Par Call Date, the make-whole premium does not apply. The amount of time by which the Par Call Date precedes the maturity date of the respective note varies from one to six months.\nWe have entered into a Registration Rights Agreement that is in effect through the maturity of the applicable Senior Secured Notes. This agreement calls for us to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement and have it declared effective within a particular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a certain period of time. If a default occurs, we will pay additional interest up to a maximum increase of 0.50% per annum. We have not accrued any obligations associated with the Registration Rights Agreement as compliance with the agreements is considered probable.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 14, 2021, T-Mobile USA issued $1.0 billion of 2.250% Senior Notes due 2026, $1.0 billion of 2.625% Senior Notes due 2029, and $1.0 billion of 2.875% Senior Notes due 2031. We intend to use the net proceeds of $3.0 billion for general corporate purposes, which may include among other things, financing acquisitions of additional spectrum and refinancing existing indebtedness on an ongoing basis.\nDebt Assumed\nIn connection with the Merger, we assumed the following indebtedness of Sprint:\n(1)In connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed Sprint\u2019s spectrum-backed notes, which are collateralized by the acquired directly held and third-party leased Spectrum licenses. See \u201cSpectrum Financing\u201d section below for further information.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nRedemptions and Repayments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repaid the following loan facilities and redeemed the following Senior Notes held by third parties and Senior Notes held by affiliates:\n(1)Write-off of premiums, discounts and issuance costs are included in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Write-off of issuance costs are included in Loss on redemption of debt within Net cash provided by operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n(2)Primarily represents a reimbursement of a portion of the commitment letter fees that were paid to financial institutions when we drew down on the Secured Bridge Loan Facility on April 1, 2020 and is included in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n(3)Pursuant to the Financing Matters Agreement, the Senior Notes were effectively redeemed through a repurchase and were cancelled and retired in full on April 1, 2020.\nOn April 9, 2020, we repaid all of the outstanding amounts under, and terminated, our $19.0 billion New Secured Bridge Loan Facility. Additionally, in connection with the repayment of our New Secured Bridge Loan Facility, we received a reimbursement of $71 million, which represents a portion of the Commitment Letter fees that were paid to certain financial institutions when we drew down on the New Secured Bridge Loan Facility on April 1, 2020. The reimbursement is presented in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nOn July 4, 2020, we redeemed $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 102.167% of the principal amount of the notes (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon), and were paid on July 6, 2020. The redemption premium was approximately $22 million and the write off of issuance costs and consent fees was approximately $12 million, which were included in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Losses on redemption of debt in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nOn July 4, 2020, we also redeemed $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2021, as further described below under \u201cSenior Notes to Affiliates.\u201d\nOn August 15, 2020, we redeemed at maturity $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7.000% Senior Notes due 2020 (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon).\nOn September 1, 2020, we redeemed $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6.375% Senior Notes due 2025.

The write off of discounts and issuance costs was approximately $100 million, which were included in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nFinancing Matters Agreement\nPursuant to the Financing Matters Agreement, DT agreed, among other things, to consent to the incurrence by T-Mobile USA of secured debt in connection with and after the consummation of the Merger, and to provide a lock up on sales thereby as to certain Senior Notes of T-Mobile USA held thereby. In connection with receiving the requisite consents, we made upfront payments to DT of $7 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt to affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we:\n\u2022Repaid our $4.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT, consisting of a $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility due 2022 and a $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility due 2024;\n\u2022Terminated our revolving credit facility;\n\u2022Repurchased from DT $4.0 billion of indebtedness to affiliates, consisting of $2.0 billion of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021 and $2.0 billion of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024;\n\u2022Amended the $1.25 billion of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and $1.25 billion of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027, which represent indebtedness to affiliates, to change the maturity dates thereof to April 15, 2021 and April 15, 2022, respectively (the \u201c2025 and 2027 Amendments\u201d); and\n\u2022Made an additional payment for requisite consents to DT of $13 million. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt to affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn accordance with the consents received from DT, on December 20, 2018, T-Mobile USA, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 38th supplemental indenture to the Indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to certain T-Mobile USA Senior Notes held by DT, the Debt Amendments (as defined below under \u201cConsents on Debt to Third Parties\u201d) and the 2025 and 2027 Amendments became effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.\nSenior Notes to Affiliates\nOn July 4, 2020, we redeemed $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2021. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount of the notes (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon), and were paid on July 6, 2020. The write off of discounts was approximately $15 million and was included in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Losses on redemption of debt in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nConsents on Debt to Third Parties\nOn May 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the Consent Solicitation Statement, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to our Senior Notes to third parties in connection with the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Consent Solicitation Statement, third-party note holders agreed, among other things, to consent to increasing the amount of Secured Indebtedness under credit facilities that can be incurred from the greater of $9.0 billion and 150% of Consolidated Cash Flow to the greater of $9.0 billion and an amount that would not cause the Secured Debt to Cash Flow Ratio (calculated net of cash and cash equivalents) to exceed 2.00x (the \u201cRatio Secured Debt Amendments\u201d) and in each case as such capitalized term is defined in the Indenture. In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Ratio Secured Debt Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $17 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt.\nIn addition, note holders agreed, among other things, to allow certain entities related to Sprint\u2019s existing spectrum securitization notes program (\u201cExisting Sprint Spectrum Program\u201d) to be non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, provided that the principal amount of the spectrum notes issued and outstanding under the Existing Sprint Spectrum Program does not exceed $7.0 billion and that the principal amount of such spectrum notes reduces the amount available under the credit facilities ratio basket, and to\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nrevise the definition of GAAP to mean generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time, unless the Company elects to \u201cfreeze\u201d GAAP as of any date, and to exclude the effect of the changes in the accounting treatment of lease obligations (the \u201cExisting Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Amendments,\u201d and together with the Ratio Secured Debt Amendments, the \u201cDebt Amendments\u201d). In connection with receiving the requisite consents for the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $14 million during the second quarter of 2018. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt.\nIn connection with obtaining the requisite consents, on May 20, 2018, T-Mobile USA, the guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 37th supplemental indenture to the Indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to each of our Senior Notes to third parties, all the amendments mentioned above (collectively, the \u201cDebt Amendments\u201d) would become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.\nWe paid third-party bank fees associated with obtaining the requisite consents related to the Debt Amendments of $6 million during the second quarter of 2018, which we recognized as Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we made additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the Ratio Secured Debt Amendments of $54 million and related to the Existing Sprint Spectrum and GAAP Amendments of $41 million. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt.\nSpectrum Financing\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed Sprint\u2019s spectrum-backed notes, which are collateralized by the acquired directly held and third-party leased Spectrum licenses (collectively, the \u201cSpectrum Portfolio\u201c) transferred to wholly owned bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (collectively, the \u201cSpectrum Financing SPEs\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the total outstanding obligations under these Notes was $4.6 billion.\nIn October 2016, certain subsidiaries of Sprint Communications, Inc. transferred the Spectrum Portfolio to the Spectrum Financing SPEs, which was used as collateral to raise an initial $3.5 billion in senior secured notes (the \u201c2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes\u201d) bearing interest at 3.360% per annum under a $7.0 billion securitization program. The 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes are repayable over a five-year term, with interest-only payments over the first four quarters and amortizing quarterly principal payments thereafter commencing December 2017 through September 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we made scheduled principal repayments of $656 million, resulting in a total principal amount outstanding related to the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes of $656 million as of December 31, 2020, which was classified as Short-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn March 2018, Sprint issued approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the \u201c2018 Spectrum-Backed Notes\u201d and together with the 2016 Spectrum-Backed Notes, the \u201cSpectrum-Backed Notes\u201d) under the existing $7.0 billion securitization program, consisting of two series of senior secured notes. The first series of notes totaled $2.1 billion in aggregate principal amount, bears interest at 4.738% per annum, and has quarterly interest-only payments until June 2021, and amortizing quarterly principal amounts thereafter commencing in June 2021 through March 2025. As of December 31, 2020, $394 million of the aggregate principal amount was classified as Short-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The second series of notes totaled approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount, bears interest at 5.152% per annum, and has quarterly interest-only payments until June 2023, and amortizing quarterly principal amounts thereafter commencing in June 2023 through March 2028. The Spectrum Portfolio, which also serves as collateral for the Spectrum-Backed Notes, remains substantially identical to the original portfolio from October 2016.\nSimultaneously with the October 2016 offering, Sprint Communications, Inc. entered a long-term lease with the Spectrum Financing SPEs for the ongoing use of the Spectrum Portfolio. Sprint Communications, Inc. is required to make monthly lease payments to the Spectrum Financing SPEs in an aggregate amount that is market-based relative to the spectrum usage rights as of the closing date and equal to $165 million per month. The lease payments, which are guaranteed by T-Mobile subsidiaries, are sufficient to service all outstanding series of the 2016 Spectrum Backed Notes and the lease also constitutes collateral for the senior secured notes. Because the Spectrum Financing SPEs are wholly owned T-Mobile subsidiaries, these entities are consolidated and all intercompany activity has been eliminated.\nEach Spectrum Financing SPE is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, prior to and upon the liquidation of the respective Spectrum Financing SPE, to be satisfied out of the Spectrum Financing SPE\u2019s assets prior to any assets of such Spectrum Financing SPE becoming available to T-Mobile. Accordingly, the assets of each Spectrum\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFinancing SPE are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations owed to other creditors of T-Mobile until the obligations of such Spectrum Financing SPE under the spectrum-backed senior secured notes are paid in full. Certain provisions of the Spectrum Financing facility require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash.\nRestricted Cash\nCertain provisions of our debt agreements require us to maintain specified cash collateral balances. Amounts associated with these balances are considered to be restricted cash.\nStandby Letters of Credit\nFor the purposes of securing our obligations to provide device insurance services and for purposes of securing our general purpose obligations, we maintain standby letters of credit with certain financial institutions. We assumed certain of Sprint\u2019s standby letters of credit in the Merger. Our outstanding standby letters of credit were $555 million and $113 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 9 - Tower Obligations\nExisting CCI Tower Lease Arrangements\nIn 2012, we conveyed to Crown Castle International Corp. (\u201cCCI\u201d) the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 7,100 tower sites (\u201cCCI Lease Sites\u201d) via a master prepaid lease with site lease terms ranging from 23 to 37 years (the \u201c2012 Tower Transaction\u201d). CCI has fixed-price purchase options for the CCI Lease Sites totaling approximately $2.0 billion, exercisable at the end of the lease term. We lease back a portion of the space at certain tower sites for an initial term of 10 years, followed by optional renewals at customary terms.\nAssets and liabilities associated with the operation of the tower sites were transferred to special purpose entities (\u201cSPEs\u201d). Assets included ground lease agreements or deeds for the land on which the towers are situated, the towers themselves and existing subleasing agreements with other mobile network operator tenants that lease space at the tower sites. Liabilities included the obligation to pay ground lease rentals, property taxes and other executory costs.\nWe determined the SPEs containing the CCI Lease Sites (\u201cLease Site SPEs\u201d) are VIEs as they lack sufficient equity to finance their activities. We have a variable interest in the Lease Site VIE but are not the primary beneficiary as we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Lease Site VIE\u2019s economic performance. These activities include managing tenants and underlying ground leases, performing repair and maintenance on the towers, the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive the expected future residual returns from the purchase option to acquire the CCI Lease Sites. As we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary and do not have a controlling financial interest in the Lease Site SPEs, the Lease Site SPEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\nHowever, we also considered if this arrangement resulted in the sale of the CCI Lease Sites for which we would de-recognize the tower assets. By assessing whether control had transferred, we concluded that transfer of control criteria, as discussed in the revenue standard, were not met. Accordingly, we recorded this arrangement as a financing whereby we recorded debt, a financial obligation, and the CCI Lease Sites tower assets remained on our balance sheet. We recorded long-term financial obligations in the amount of the net proceeds received and recognize interest on the tower obligations at a rate of approximately 8% using the effective interest method. The tower obligations are increased by interest expense and amortized through contractual leaseback payments made by us to CCI and through net cash flows generated and retained by CCI from operation of the tower sites.\nAcquired CCI Tower Lease Arrangements\nPrior to the Merger, Sprint entered into a lease-out and leaseback arrangement with Global Signal Inc., a third party that was subsequently acquired by CCI, that conveyed to CCI the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 6,400 tower sites (\u201cMaster Lease Sites\u201d) via a master prepaid lease. These agreements were assumed upon the close of the Merger, at which point the remaining term of the lease-out was approximately 17 years with no renewal options. CCI has a fixed price purchase option for all (but not less than all) of the leased or subleased sites for approximately $2.3 billion, exercisable one year prior to the\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nexpiration of the agreement and ending 120 days prior to the expiration of the agreement. We lease back a portion of the space at certain tower sites for an initial term of 10 years, followed by optional renewals at customary terms.\nWe considered if this arrangement resulted in the sale of the Master Lease Sites for which we would de-recognize the tower assets. By assessing whether control had transferred, we concluded that transfer of control criteria, as discussed in the revenue standard, were not met. Accordingly, we recorded this arrangement as a financing whereby we recorded debt, a financial obligation, and the Master Lease Sites tower assets remained on our balance sheet.\nAs of the Merger date, we recognized Property and equipment with a fair value of $2.8 billion and tower obligations related to amounts owed to CCI under the leaseback of $1.1 billion. Additionally, we recognized $1.7 billion in Other long-term liabilities associated with contract terms that are unfavorable to current market rates, which includes unfavorable terms associated with the fixed-price purchase option in 2037.\nWe recognize interest expense on the tower obligations at a rate of approximately 6% using the effective interest method. The tower obligations are increased by interest expense and amortized through contractual leaseback payments made by us to CCI. The tower assets are reported in Property and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the expected useful life of the tower, which is 20 years.\nThe following table summarizes the balances associated with both of the tower arrangements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nFuture minimum payments related to the tower obligations are approximately $397 million for the year ending December 31, 2021, $716 million in total for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023, $598 million in total for years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, and $624 million in total for years thereafter.\nWe are contingently liable for future ground lease payments through the remaining term of the CCI Lease Sites and the Master Lease Sites. These contingent obligations are not included in Operating lease liabilities as any amount due is contractually owed by CCI based on the subleasing arrangement. Under the arrangement, we remain primarily liable for ground lease payments on approximately 900 sites and have included lease liabilities of $282 million in our Operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\nNote 10 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nWe provide wireless communications services to three primary categories of customers:\n\u2022Postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, wearables, DIGITS, or other connected devices which includes tablets and SyncUP products. Our postpaid customers include customers of T-Mobile;\n\u2022Prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communications services in advance. Our prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile; and\n\u2022Wholesale customers include Machine-to-Machine and Mobile Virtual Network Operator customers that operate on our network but are managed by wholesale partners.\nPostpaid service revenues, including postpaid phone revenues and postpaid other revenues, were as follows:\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe operate as a single operating segment. The balances presented within each revenue line item in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income represent categories of revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by type of product and service. Service revenues also include revenues earned for providing value added services to customers, such as device insurance services. Revenue generated from the lease of mobile communication devices is included within Equipment revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nWe provide wireline communication services to domestic and international customers. Wireline service revenues of $626 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, relate to the wireline operations acquired in the Merger and are presented in Roaming and other service revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nEquipment revenues from the lease of mobile communication devices were as follows:\nContract Balances\nThe opening and closing balances of our contract asset and contract liability balances from contracts with customers as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, were as follows:\nContract assets primarily represent revenue recognized for equipment sales with promotional bill credits offered to customers that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract. Through the Merger, we acquired contracts assets associated with promotional bill credits and subsidized devices with a value of $154 million as of April 1, 2020.\nThe change in the existing and acquired contract asset balance includes customer activity related to new promotions, offset by billings on existing contracts and impairment which is recognized as bad debt expense. The current portion of our Contract assets of approximately $204 million and $50 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nContract liabilities are recorded when fees are collected, or we have an unconditional right to consideration (a receivable) in advance of delivery of goods or services. Through the Merger, we assumed contract liabilities with a value of $336 million as of April 1, 2020. Additional changes in contract liabilities are primarily related to the volume and rate plans of active prepaid customers. Contract liabilities are primarily included in Deferred revenue in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRevenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, include the following:\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining service performance obligations for postpaid contracts with subsidized devices and promotional bill credits that result in an extended service contract is $1.5 billion. We expect to recognize revenue as service is provided on these postpaid contracts over an extended contract term of 24 months. Transaction price allocated to remaining service performance obligations associated with subsidized devices and promotional bill credits acquired through the Merger at April 1, 2020, was $1.0 billion.\nThrough the Merger, on April 1, 2020, we acquired contracts associated with lease promotional credits with aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining service and lease performance obligations of $4.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining service and lease\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nperformance obligations associated with operating leases was $2.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. We expect to recognize this revenue as service is provided over the lease contract term of 18 months.\nInformation about remaining performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less have been excluded from the above, which primarily consists of monthly service contracts.\nCertain of our wholesale, roaming and other service contracts include variable consideration based on usage. This variable consideration has been excluded from the disclosure of remaining performance obligations. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the contractual minimum consideration for wholesale, roaming and other service contracts is $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $317 million for 2021, 2022, and 2023 and beyond, respectively. These contracts have a remaining duration ranging from less than one year to nine years.\nContract Costs\nThe total balance of deferred incremental costs to obtain contracts was $1.1 billion and $906 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred contract costs incurred to obtain postpaid service contracts are amortized over a period of 24 months. The amortization period is monitored to reflect any significant change in assumptions. Amortization of deferred contract costs is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and was $865 million and $604 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nImmediately preceding the close of the Merger, Sprint had deferred costs to obtain postpaid contracts of approximately $1.7 billion. This balance was adjusted to zero as part of our purchase price allocation. Contract costs capitalized for new postpaid contracts will accumulate in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets from the Merger close date. As a result, there was a net benefit to Operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the year ended December 31, 2020, as capitalization of costs exceed amortization. As capitalized costs amortize into expense over time, the accretive benefit to Operating income is expected to moderate in 2021 and normalize in 2022.\nThe deferred contract cost asset is assessed for impairment on a periodic basis. There were no impairment losses recognized on deferred contract cost assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nNote 11 - Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans\nUnder our 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the Sprint Corporation Amended and Restated 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan that T-Mobile assumed in connection with the closing of the Merger, as described below (the \u201cIncentive Plans\u201d), we are authorized to issue up to 101 million shares of our common stock. Under our Incentive Plans, we can grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), and performance awards to eligible employees, consultants, advisors and non-employee directors. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 25 million shares of common stock available for future grants under our Incentive Plans.\nWe grant RSUs to eligible employees, key executives and certain non-employee directors and performance-based restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d) to eligible key executives. RSUs entitle the grantee to receive shares of our common stock upon vesting (with vesting generally occurring annually over a three-year period), subject to continued service through the applicable vesting date. PRSUs entitle the holder to receive shares of our common stock at the end of a performance period of generally up to three years if the applicable performance goals are achieved and generally subject to continued service through the applicable performance period. The number of shares ultimately received by the holder of PRSUs is dependent on our business performance against the specified performance goal(s) over a pre-established performance period. We also maintain an employee stock purchase plan (\u201cESPP\u201d), under which eligible employees can purchase our common stock at a discounted price.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nStock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:\nStock Awards\nOn April 1, 2020, we closed the Merger to combine T-Mobile and Sprint pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, upon the completion of the Merger, T-Mobile assumed Sprint\u2019s stock compensation plans. In addition, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Sprint common stock (other than under Sprint\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase Plan), each award of time-based RSUs in respect of shares of Sprint common stock and each award of performance-based RSUs in respect of shares of Sprint common stock, in each case, that was outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was automatically adjusted by the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and converted into an equity award of the same type covering shares of T-Mobile common stock, on the same terms and conditions, (including, if applicable, any continuing vesting requirements (but excluding any performance-based vesting conditions)) under the applicable Sprint plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the \u201cAssumed Awards\u201d). The applicable amount of performance-based RSUs eligible for conversion was based on formulas and approximated 100% of target. Any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents with respect to any such award of time-based RSUs or performance-based RSUs were assumed by T-Mobile at the Effective Time and became an obligation with respect to the applicable award of RSUs in respect of shares of T-Mobile common stock.\nOn April 22, 2020, we filed a Form S-8 to register a total of 25,304,224 shares of common stock, representing those covered by the Sprint Corporation 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Program, the Sprint Corporation 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the Sprint Corporation Amended and Restated 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d) that T-Mobile assumed in connection with the closing of the Merger. This included 7,043,843 shares of T-Mobile common stock issuable upon exercise or settlement of the Assumed Awards held by current directors, officers, employees and consultants of T-Mobile or its subsidiaries who were directors, officers, employees and consultants of Sprint or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, as well as (i) 12,420,945 shares of T-Mobile common stock that remain available for issuance under the 2015 Plan and (ii) 5,839,436 additional shares of T-Mobile common stock subject to awards granted under the 2015 Plan that may become available for issuance under the 2015 Plan if any awards under the 2015 Plan are forfeited, lapse unexercised or are settled in cash.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Awards\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Awards\nPRSUs included in the table above are shown at target. Share payout can range from 0% to 200% based on different performance outcomes. Weighted average grant date fair value of RSU and PRSU assumed through acquisition is based on the fair value on the date assumed.\n(1)Represents PRSUs granted prior to 2020 for which the performance achievement period was completed in 2020, resulting in incremental unit awards. These PRSU awards are also included in the amount vested in 2020.\nPayment of the underlying shares in connection with the vesting of RSU and PRSU awards generally triggers a tax obligation for the employee, which is required to be remitted to the relevant tax authorities. We have agreed to withhold shares of common stock otherwise issuable under the RSU and PRSU awards to cover certain of these tax obligations, with the net shares issued to the employee accounted for as outstanding common stock. We withheld 4,441,107 and 2,094,555 shares of common stock to cover tax obligations associated with the payment of shares upon vesting of stock awards and remitted cash of $439 million and $156 million to the appropriate tax authorities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 15% of their eligible earnings toward the semi-annual purchase of our shares of common stock at a discounted price, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. Employees can purchase stock at a 15% discount applied to the closing stock price on the first or last day of the six-month offering period, whichever price is lower. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was 2,144,036 and 2,091,650 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the number of securities remaining available for future sale and issuance under the ESPP was 4,253,858. Sprint\u2019s ESPP was terminated prior to the Merger close and legacy Sprint employees were eligible to enroll in our ESPP on August 15, 2020.\nOur ESPP provides for an annual increase in the aggregate number of shares of our common stock reserved for sale and authorized for issuance thereunder as of the first day of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2016) equal to the lesser of (i) 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, and (ii) the number of shares of T-Mobile common stock determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d). For fiscal years 2016 through 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that no such increase in shares of our common stock was necessary. However, an additional 5,000,000 shares of our common stock were automatically added to the ESPP share reserve as of January 1, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nStock Options\nStock options outstanding relate to the Metro Communications, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, the Amended and Restated Metro Communications, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, the Layer3 TV, Inc. 2013 Stock Plan, and the Sprint 2015 Plan (collectively, the \u201cStock Option Plans\u201d). No new awards may be granted under the Stock Option Plans, and no awards were granted during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following activity occurred under the Stock Option Plans:\nWeighted average grant date fair value of stock options assumed through acquisition is based on the fair value on the date assumed.\nStock options exercised under the Stock Option Plans generated proceeds of approximately $48 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe grant-date fair value of share-based incentive compensation awards attributable to post-combination services, including restricted stock units and stock options, from our Merger with Sprint was approximately $163 million.\nPension and Other Post Retirement Benefits Plans\nUpon the completion of our Merger with Sprint, we acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities associated with the Sprint Retirement Pension Plan (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d) as well as other postretirement employee benefit plans. As of December 31, 2005, the Pension Plan was amended to freeze benefit plan accruals for the participants. The plan assets acquired and obligations assumed were recognized at fair value on the Merger close date.\nThe objective for the investment portfolio of the Pension Plan is to achieve a long-term nominal rate of return, net of fees, that exceeds the Pension Plan's long-term expected rate of return on investments for funding purposes. To meet this objective, our investment strategy is governed by an asset allocation policy, whereby a targeted allocation percentage is assigned to each asset class as follows: 24% to U.S. equities; 17% to international equities; 44% to fixed income investments; 11% to real estate investments; and 4% to other investments including hedge funds. Actual allocations are allowed to deviate from target allocation percentages within a range for each asset class as defined in the investment policy. The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets was 5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, while the actual rate of return on plan assets was 21% during that period. The long-term expected rate of return on investments for funding purposes is 4% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe components of net expense recognized for the Pension Plan were as follows:\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe net expense associated with the Pension Plan is included in Other expense, net of our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nInvestments of the Pension Plan are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which is determined using quoted market prices or estimated fair values. As of December 31, 2020, 12% of the investment portfolio was valued at quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, 85% was valued using quoted prices for similar assets in active or inactive markets, or other observable inputs, and 3% was valued using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, the majority of which used the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to measure the fair value.\nThe fair values of our Pension Plan assets and certain other postretirement benefit plan assets in aggregate were $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion and our accumulated benefit obligations in aggregate were $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion as of April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As a result, the plans were underfunded by approximately $892 million and $828 million as of April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and were recorded in Other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In determining our pension obligation for the year ended December 31, 2020, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 3%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we made contributions of $58 million to the benefit plans. No contributions were made by T-Mobile in fiscal periods prior to 2020. We expect to make contributions to the Plan of $89 million through the year ending December 31, 2021.\nFuture benefits expected to be paid are approximately $97 million for the year ending December 31, 2021, $198 million in total for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023, $206 million in total for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, and $548 million in total for the years ending December 31, 2026, through December 31, 2030.\nEmployee Retirement Savings Plan\nWe sponsor retirement savings plans for the majority of our employees under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and similar plans. The plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their pretax and post-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. The plans provide that we match a percentage of employee contributions up to certain limits. Employer matching contributions were $179 million, $119 million and $102 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNote 12 - Discontinued Operations\nOn July 26, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Sprint and DISH. On June 17, 2020, T-Mobile, Sprint and DISH entered into the First Amendment. Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement, T-Mobile, Sprint and DISH agreed to proceed with the closing of the Prepaid Transaction in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement on July 1, 2020, subject to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Consent Decree.\nOn July 1, 2020, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we completed the Prepaid Transaction. Upon closing of the Prepaid Transaction, we received $1.4 billion from DISH for the Prepaid Business, subject to a working capital adjustment. The close of the Prepaid Transaction did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe assets of the Prepaid Business included EIP receivables originated pursuant to financed equipment purchases by customers of the Prepaid Business. At the time of the Prepaid Transaction, DISH did not hold certain licenses required to purchase or originate such contracts. In order to transfer the economics of the contracts to DISH without transferring ownership of them, the parties entered into a Participation Agreement under which we agreed to transfer a 100% participation interest in the contracts to DISH. Under the terms of the agreement, DISH retains all cash flows collected on these assets, and there is no recourse against us for any credit losses on such loans. The proceeds received from DISH in exchange for this participation interest was a component of total consideration received for the Prepaid Transaction. We will temporarily continue to originate equipment installment contracts on DISH\u2019s behalf under the same terms in exchange for an amount equal to the initial outstanding principal balance of the originated contracts, again without recourse against us for any credit losses.\nOf the total $1.4 billion of proceeds received under the Prepaid Transaction, approximately $162 million was allocated to the EIP receivables to which we transferred DISH a 100% participation interest. We accounted for this portion of the proceeds as a secured borrowing and present it in Other, net, within Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows accordingly. The remaining $1.2 billion was allocated to the divested net assets of the Prepaid\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nBusiness. The net cash received for the Prepaid Business is presented in Proceeds from the divestiture of prepaid business within Net cash used in investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe results of the Prepaid Business include revenues and expenses directly attributable to the operations disposed. Corporate and administrative expenses, including Interest expense, not directly attributable to the operations were not allocated to the Prepaid Business. The results of the Prepaid Business from April 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, are presented in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe components of discontinued operations from the Merger close date of April 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, were as follows:\nNet cash provided by operating activities from the Prepaid Business included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $611 million, all of which relates to the operations of the Prepaid Business during the three months ended June 30, 2020. There were no cash flows from investing or financing activities related to the Prepaid Business for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nContinuing Involvement\nUpon the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, we and DISH entered into (i) a License Purchase Agreement pursuant to which (a) DISH has the option to purchase certain 800 MHz spectrum licenses for a total of approximately $3.6 billion in a transaction to be completed, subject to certain additional closing conditions, following an application for FCC approval to be filed three years following the closing of the Merger and (b) we will have the option to lease back from DISH, as needed, a portion of the spectrum sold for an additional two years following the closing of the spectrum sale transaction, (ii) a Transition Services Agreement providing for our provisioning of transition services to DISH in connection with the Prepaid Business for a period of up to three years following the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, (iii) a Master Network Services Agreement providing for the provisioning of network services to customers of the Prepaid Business for a period of up to seven years following the closing of the Prepaid Transaction, and (iv) an Option to Acquire Tower and Retail Assets, offering DISH the option to acquire certain decommissioned towers and retail locations from us, subject to obtaining all necessary third-party consents, for a period of up to five years following the closing of the Prepaid Transaction.\nIn the event DISH breaches the License Purchase Agreement or fails to deliver the purchase price following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions, DISH\u2019s sole liability is to pay us a fee of approximately $72 million. Additionally, if DISH does not exercise the option to purchase the 800 MHz spectrum licenses, we have an obligation to offer the licenses for sale through an auction. If the specified minimum price of $3.6 billion was not met in the auction, we would retain the licenses. As the sale of 800 MHz spectrum licenses is not expected to close within one year, the criteria for presentation as an asset held for sale is not met.\nCash flows associated with the Master Network Services Agreement and Transition Services Agreement are included within Net cash provided by operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 13 - Income Taxes\nOur sources of Income before income taxes were as follows:\nIncome tax expense is summarized as follows:\nThe reconciliation between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate is as follows:\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSignificant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, tax effected, are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have tax effected federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of $3.5 billion, state NOL carryforwards of $1.5 billion and foreign NOL carryforwards of $67 million, expiring through 2040. Federal and certain state NOLs generated in and after 2018 do not expire. As of December 31, 2020, our tax effected federal, state and foreign NOL carryforwards for financial reporting purposes were approximately $176 million, $455 million and $26 million, respectively, less than our NOL carryforwards for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes, due to unrecognized tax benefits of the same amount. The unrecognized tax benefit amounts exclude offsetting tax effects of $144 million in other jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have research and development, foreign tax and other general business credit carryforwards with a combined value of $569 million for federal income tax purposes, an immaterial amount of which begins to expire in 2021.\nAs a result of the Merger, we acquired additional deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance reserve is deemed to be necessary, as well as additional uncertain tax benefit reserves. Due to the size and complexity of the Merger, our estimate of these amounts is preliminary and is subject to finalization and adjustment, which could be material, during the measurement period of up to one year from the Merger close date. During the measurement period, we will adjust these amounts if new information is obtained about facts or circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have changed these amounts. See Note 2 - Business Combination for further information.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our valuation allowance was $878 million, $129 million and $210 million, respectively. The change from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, primarily related to $848 million of deferred tax assets acquired via the Merger for which a valuation allowance is deemed necessary, partially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in federal and certain other jurisdictions associated with additional tax attribute utilization and expiration. The change from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, primarily related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions resulting from legal entity reorganizations. We will continue to monitor positive and negative evidence related to the utilization of the remaining deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance continues to be provided. It is possible that our valuation allowance may change within the next 12 months.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by various states. Management does not believe the resolution of any of the audits will result in a material change to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The IRS has concluded its audits of our federal tax returns through the 2009 tax year; however, NOL and other carryforwards for certain audited periods remain open for examination. U.S. federal, state and foreign examination for years prior to 2001 are generally closed.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had $857 million, $310 million and $263 million, respectively, in unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our annual effective tax rate. The balance as of December 31, 2020 includes measurement period adjustments associated with the Merger to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the effective time of the Merger. Our estimate of these unrecognized tax benefits is preliminary and is subject to finalization and adjustment, which could be material, during the measurement period of up to one year from the Merger close date. Penalties and interest on income tax assessments are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Interest expense, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are insignificant.\nNote 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction\nOn June 22, 2020, we entered into a Master Framework Agreement (the \u201cMaster Framework Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, SoftBank, SoftBank Group Capital Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of SoftBank (\u201cSBGC\u201d), Delaware Project 4 L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SoftBank, Delaware Project 6 L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SoftBank, Claure Mobile LLC (\u201cCM LLC\u201d), DT, and T-Mobile Agent LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nThe Master Framework Agreement and related transactions were entered into to facilitate SoftBank\u2019s monetization of a portion of our common stock held by SoftBank (the \u201cSoftBank Monetization\u201d). In connection with the Master Framework Agreement, DT waived the restriction on the transfer under its Proxy, Lock-Up and ROFR Agreement, dated April 1, 2020, with SoftBank (the \u201cSoftBank Proxy Agreement\u201d) with respect to approximately 198 million shares of our common stock held by SoftBank (the \u201cReleased Shares\u201d). Upon the close of the Public Equity Offering (as defined below), we received a payment from SoftBank for $304 million for our role in facilitating the SoftBank Monetization. The payment received from SoftBank, net of tax, of $230 million was recorded as Additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is presented as a reduction of Repurchases of common stock within Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nUnder the terms of the Master Framework Agreement and the agreements contemplated thereby, SBGC sold the Released Shares to us, and we participated in the following transactions:\nPublic Equity Offering\nOn June 26, 2020, we completed a registered public offering of approximately 154.1 million shares of our common stock (the \u201cPublic Equity Offering\u201d) at a price of $103.00 per share. The net proceeds of the Public Equity Offering were used to repurchase an equal number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from SBGC, pursuant to a Share Repurchase Agreement, dated as of June 22, 2020 (the \u201cShare Repurchase Agreement\u201d), between us and SBGC.\nMandatory Exchangeable Offering\nConcurrent with the Public Equity Offering, we sold approximately 19.4 million shares of our common stock to a third-party trust. The net proceeds from the sale of shares to the trust were used to repurchase an equal number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from SBGC.\nThe trust issued mandatory exchangeable trust securities, which entitle holders to receive quarterly distributions from the trust and a final mandatory exchange price to be settled on June 1, 2023 (\u201cMandatory Exchangeable Offering\u201d).\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe trust was required to use a portion of the net proceeds from the Mandatory Exchangeable Offering to purchase U.S. Treasury securities, to fund quarterly distributions on the mandatory exchangeable trust securities, and the holders of the mandatory exchangeable trust securities will be entitled to a final mandatory exchange amount on June 1, 2023 that will depend on the daily volume-weighted average price of shares of our common stock.\nThe sale of shares through the Public Equity Offering and to the trust occurred simultaneously with the purchase of shares from SBGC. These simultaneous transactions did not result in a net change to our treasury shares or shares of common stock outstanding.\nAs these transactions occurred with separate counterparties, the exchange of shares and cash are presented on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statement of Stockholders\u2019 Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. The shares sold are presented in Shares issued in secondary offering and the shares purchased from SBGC are presented in Shares repurchased from SoftBank within our Consolidated Statement of Stockholders\u2019 Equity. The cash received from the sale of shares is presented in Issuance of common stock and the cash paid to purchase shares from SoftBank are presented in Repurchases of common stock within Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe Company is not affiliated with the trust, will not retain any proceeds from the offering of the trust securities, and will have no ongoing interest, economic or otherwise, in the trust securities.\nRights Offering\nThe Master Framework Agreement provides for the issuance of registered, transferable subscription rights (the \u201cRights Offering\u201d) resulting in the sale of 19,750,000 shares of our common stock to our stockholders (other than SoftBank, DT and Marcelo Claure and their respective affiliates, who agreed to waive their ability to exercise or transfer such rights). The subscription rights provided the stockholders the option to purchase one share of common stock for every 20 shares of common stock owned, at the same price per share as the common stock sold in the Public Equity Offering of $103.00 per share.\nThe Rights Offering exercise period expired on July 27, 2020. On August 3, 2020, the Rights Offering closed, resulting in the sale of 19,750,000 shares of our common stock. The net proceeds from the Rights Offering were used to purchase an equal number of shares from SBGC pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement.\nMarcelo Claure\nThe Master Framework Agreement provided for the purchase of 5.0 million shares of our common stock by Marcelo Claure, a member of our board of directors, from us at the same price per share as the common stock sold in the Public Equity Offering of $103.00 per share.\nFollowing receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals on July 16, 2020, the sale of shares to Marcelo Claure occurred simultaneously with our purchase of an equivalent number of shares from SBGC at the same price per share pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement.\nOwnership Following the SoftBank Monetization\nAs of December 31, 2020, DT and SoftBank held, directly or indirectly, approximately 43.4% and 8.6%, respectively, of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 48.0% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock held by other stockholders.\nThe SoftBank Proxy Agreement remains in effect with respect to the remaining shares of our common stock held by SoftBank. In addition, on June 22, 2020, DT, CM LLC, and Marcelo Claure entered into a Proxy, Lock-Up and ROFR Agreement (the \u201cClaure Proxy Agreement,\u201d together with the SoftBank Proxy Agreement, the \u201cProxy Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which any shares of our common stock acquired after June 22, 2020 by Mr. Claure or CM LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Claure, other than shares acquired as a result of Mr. Claure\u2019s role as a director or officer of the Company, will be voted in the manner as directed by DT.\nAccordingly, as a result of the Proxy Agreements, DT has voting control as of December 31, 2020 over approximately 52.3% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nDT Call Option\nIn exchange for DT consenting to the transfer of the Released Shares and as provided for in the Master Framework Agreement, DT received direct and indirect call options over up to approximately 101.5 million shares of our common stock held by SBGC. The arrangement provided DT with a fixed-price call option to purchase up to approximately 44.9 million shares at a price of $101.46 per share indirectly from SBGC through a back-to-back arrangement where (i) DT could purchase such shares from us (the \u201cDT Fixed-Price Call Option\u201d) and (ii) we would fulfill our obligations under the DT Fixed-Price Call Option by simultaneously purchasing the same number of shares on the same economic terms from SBGC (the \u201cT-Mobile Fixed-Price Call Option\u201d). In addition, DT has a floating-price call option to purchase up to approximately 56.6 million shares from SBGC directly.\nThe DT Fixed-Price Call Option and the T-Mobile Fixed-Price Call Option represented free-standing derivatives and were recorded at fair value and marked-to-market each period. As the mark-to-market valuations of the T-Mobile Fixed-Price Call Option and the DT Fixed-Price Call Option moved in equal and offsetting directions, there was no net impact on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nOn October 6, 2020, we assigned our rights under the T-Mobile Fixed-Price Call Option to DT and DT terminated its right to purchase shares from us under the DT Fixed-Price Call Option, resulting in derecognition of the related derivative asset and liability in equal and offsetting amounts of $1.0 billion such that there was no net impact to our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNote 15 - Repurchases of Common Stock\n2017 Stock Repurchase Program\nOn December 6, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2018 (the \u201c2017 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). Repurchased shares are retired. The 2017 Stock Repurchase Program completed on April 29, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding repurchases of our common stock under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program:\n(In millions, except shares and per share price)\nStock Purchases by Affiliate\nIn the first quarter of 2018, DT, our majority stockholder and an affiliated purchaser, purchased 3.3 million additional shares of our common stock at an aggregate market value of $200 million in the public market or from other parties, in accordance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. There were no purchases in 2019 and 2020. We did not receive proceeds from these purchases.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 16 - Earnings Per Share\nThe computation of basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows:\n(1) Represents the weighted average SoftBank Specified Shares outstanding from April 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020.\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we amended and restated the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation in the form of the Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cRestated Certificate\u201d). Pursuant to the Restated Certificate, the authorized capital stock of T-Mobile consists of 2,000,000,000 shares of T-Mobile common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had authorized 100 million shares of preferred stock, with a par value of $0.00001 per share. There was no preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share if to do so would have been anti-dilutive or if there was a loss from continuing operations for the period.\nThe SoftBank Specified Shares Amount of 48,751,557 was determined to be contingent consideration for the Merger and is not dilutive until the defined volume-weighted average price per share is reached.\nNote 17 - Leases\nLessee\nThrough the Merger, we acquired leases of real property, including cell sites, switch sites, dark fiber, retail stores and office facilities and recorded lease liabilities and associated right-of-use assets based on the discounted lease payments. Lease terms that are favorable or unfavorable to market terms were recorded as an adjustment to lease right-of-use assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Favorable and unfavorable leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the associated remaining lease term.\nOn September 14, 2020, T-Mobile and American Tower Corporation (\u201cAmerican Tower\u201d) entered into a lease agreement (the \u201cAmerican Tower Lease Agreement\u201d) that will enable us to lease American Tower towers through April 2035. The American Tower Lease Agreement extended the term and modified the rental payments for approximately 20,729 American Tower towers currently leased by us. As a result of this modification, we remeasured the associated right-of-use assets and lease liabilities resulting in an increase of $11.0 billion to each on the effective date of the modification.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nInformation relating to the lease term and discount rate is as follows:\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020, were as follows:\nInterest payments for financing leases were $79 million and $82 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have additional operating leases for cell sites and commercial properties that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of approximately $227 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were contingently liable for future ground lease payments related to certain tower obligations. These contingent obligations are not included in the above table as the amounts owed are contractually owed by Crown Castle International Corp. based on the subleasing arrangement. See Note 9 - Tower Obligations for further information.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nLessor\nThrough the Merger, we acquired leased wireless devices with a fair value of $5.8 billion as of April 1, 2020.\nThe components of leased wireless devices under our Leasing Programs were as follows:\nFor equipment revenues from the lease of mobile communication devices, see Note 10 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nFuture minimum payments expected to be received over the lease term related to leased wireless devices, which exclude optional residual buy-out amounts at the end of the lease term, are summarized below:\nNote 18 - Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nWe have commitments for non-dedicated transportation lines with varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2029. In addition, we have commitments to purchase wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business, with various terms through 2043.\nOur purchase commitments, including purchase commitments assumed through the Merger, are approximately $5.0 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021, $4.5 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023, $2.4 billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 and $1.7 billion in total for the years thereafter. These amounts are not reflective of our entire anticipated purchases under the related agreements but are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated.\nSpectrum Leases\nIn connection with the Merger, we assumed certain spectrum lease contracts from Sprint that include service obligations to the lessors. Certain of the spectrum leases provide for minimum lease payments, additional charges, renewal options and escalation clauses. Leased spectrum agreements have varying expiration terms that generally extend through 2050. We expect that all renewal periods in our spectrum leases will be exercised by us.\nOur spectrum lease and service credit commitments, including renewal periods, are approximately $338 million for the year ending December 31, 2021, $675 million in total for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023, $594 million in total for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 and $5.1 billion in total for the years thereafter.\nWe accrue a monthly obligation for the services and equipment based on the total estimated available service credits divided by the term of the lease. The obligation is reduced by services provided and as actual invoices are presented and paid to the lessors. The maximum remaining service commitment on December 31, 2020 was $92 million and is expected to be incurred over the term of the related lease agreements, which generally range from 15 to 30 years.\nMerger Commitments\nIn connection with the regulatory proceedings and approvals of the Transactions, we have commitments and other obligations to various state and federal agencies and certain nongovernmental organizations, including pursuant to the Consent Decree agreed to by us, DT, Sprint, SoftBank and DISH and entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and the\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFCC\u2019s memorandum opinion and order approving our applications for approval of the Merger. These commitments and obligations include, among other things, extensive 5G network build-out commitments, obligations to deliver high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans, including Americans residing in rural areas, and the marketing of an in-home broadband product where spectrum capacity is available. Other commitments relate to national security, pricing, service, employment and support of diversity initiatives. Many of the commitments specify time frames for compliance. Failure to fulfill our obligations and commitments in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions.\nWe expect that our monetary commitments associated with these matters are approximately $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $37 million in total for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 and $13 million in total for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2025. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated costs to achieve specified network coverage and performance requirements, employment targets or commitments to provide access to affordable rate plans, but represent only those amounts for which we are required to make a specified payment in connection with our commitments or settlements.\nContingencies and Litigation\nLitigation Matters\nWe are involved in various lawsuits and disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings (\u201cLitigation Matters\u201d) that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include claims of patent infringement (most of which are asserted by non-practicing entities primarily seeking monetary damages), class actions, and proceedings to enforce FCC rules and regulations. Those Litigation Matters are at various stages, and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing, or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate, which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements but that is not considered to be, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including, but not limited to, uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these Litigation Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, but we note that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the specific matters identified below could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future.\nOn February 28, 2020, we received a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture and Admonishment from the FCC, which proposed a penalty against us for allegedly violating section 222 of the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s regulations governing the privacy of customer information. We recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount as of December 31, 2020, which was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we assumed the contingencies and litigation matters of Sprint.\nThose matters include a wide variety of disputes, claims, government agency investigations and enforcement actions, and other proceedings. These matters include, among other things, certain ongoing FCC and state government agency investigations into Sprint\u2019s Lifeline program. In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving subscribers even though these subscribers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint's usage policy for the Lifeline program, due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying subscriber usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated. Sprint has made a number of payments to reimburse the federal government and certain states for excess subsidy payments. Resolution of these matters could require making additional reimbursements and paying additional fines and penalties.\nIn November 2020, we entered into a consent decree with the FCC to resolve certain of these Lifeline matters, which resulted in a payment of $200 million by SoftBank. We note that pursuant to Amendment No. 2 to the Business Combination Agreement, SoftBank agreed to indemnify us against certain specified matters and losses, including those relating to these Lifeline matters. As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a contingent liability and an offsetting indemnification asset for the expected reimbursement by SoftBank for certain Lifeline matters which have not been resolved. We expect that any additional liabilities related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by SoftBank. See Note 2 - Business Combination for further information.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 19 - Restructuring Costs\nUpon close of the Merger, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies and reduce redundancies. The major activities associated with the restructuring initiatives to date include contract termination costs associated with the rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative backhaul services and other agreements, severance costs associated with the integration of redundant processes and functions and the decommissioning of network infrastructure including cell sites and equipment to achieve synergies in network costs.\nThe following table summarizes the expenses incurred in connection with our restructuring initiatives:\nThe expenses associated with the restructuring initiatives are included in Costs of services and Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. No expenses were incurred related to our restructuring initiatives for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur restructuring initiatives also include the acceleration or termination of certain of our operating and financing leases for cell sites, switch sites, retail stores, network equipment and office facilities. Incremental expenses associated with accelerating amortization of the right-of-use assets on lease contracts were $153 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are included within Costs of services and Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe changes in the liabilities associated with our restructuring initiatives, including expenses incurred and cash payments, are as follows:\n(1) Non-cash items consists of non-cash stock-based compensation included within Severance costs and the write-off of assets within Network decommissioning.\nThe liabilities accrued in connection with our restructuring initiatives are presented in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur restructuring activities are expected to occur over the next three years with substantially all costs incurred by the end of fiscal year 2023. We are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives, which are dependent on consultations and negotiation with certain counterparties and the expected impact on our business operations, which could affect the amount or timing of the restructuring costs and related payments.\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 20 - Additional Financial Information\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities are summarized as follows:\nBook overdrafts included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were $628 million and $463 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDeutsche Telekom\nWe have related party transactions associated with DT or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, which are included in the consolidated financial statements.\nOn April 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we:\n\u2022Repaid our $4.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility with DT, consisting of a $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility due 2022 and a $2.0 billion Incremental Term Loan Facility due 2024;\n\u2022Terminated our revolving credit facility with DT;\n\u2022Repurchased from DT $4.0 billion of indebtedness to affiliates, consisting of $2.0 billion of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2021 and $2.0 billion of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024;\n\u2022Amended the $1.25 billion of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and $1.25 billion of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027, which represent indebtedness to affiliates, to change the maturity dates thereof to April 15, 2021 and April 15, 2022, respectively (the \u201c2025 and 2027 Amendments\u201d); and\n\u2022Made an additional payment for requisite consents to DT of $13 million. These payments were recognized as a reduction to Long-term debt to affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn July 4, 2020, we redeemed $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.125% Senior Notes to affiliates due 2021.\nAmounts associated with the debt owed to DT are reflected as Short-term debt to affiliates and Long-term debt to affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest related to this debt is reflected as Interest expense to affiliates in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of significant transactions with DT or its affiliates included in Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income:\nWe have an agreement with DT in which we receive reimbursement of certain administrative expenses, which was $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $11 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Amounts due\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfrom and to DT related to these agreements are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as \u201cAccounts Receivables from affiliates\u201d and \u201cPayables to affiliates,\u201d respectively.\nSoftBank\nOn June 22, 2020, we entered into a Master Framework Agreement and related transactions with SoftBank related to the SoftBank Monetization as described in Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction. On July 27, 2020, in connection with the SoftBank Monetization, the Rights Offering exercise period closed, and on August 3, 2020, the Rights Offering closed, resulting in the sale of 19,750,000 shares of our common stock. On August 3, 2020, upon completion of the SoftBank Monetization, DT and SoftBank held, directly or indirectly, approximately 43.4% and 8.6%, respectively, of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 48.0% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock held by other stockholders. As a result of the Proxy Agreements, DT has voting control as of August 3, 2020 over approximately 52.4% of the outstanding T-Mobile common stock. In addition, as provided for in the Master Framework Agreement, DT also holds certain call options over approximately 101.5 million shares of our common stock held by SBGC.\nOn October 6, 2020, we assigned our rights under the T-Mobile Fixed-Price Call Option to DT and DT terminated its right to purchase shares from us under the DT Fixed-Price Call Option, resulting in derecognition of the related derivative asset and liability in equal and offsetting amounts such that there was no net impact to our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nBrightstar\nWe had arrangements with Brightstar, a subsidiary of SoftBank, whereby Brightstar provided supply chain and inventory management services to us in our indirect channels. We have terminated or restructured most of our arrangements with Brightstar, except for reverse logistics and trade-in services. Revenue resulting from sale of devices distributed by Brightstar is generally recognized when sold to an end customer (commonly referred to as recognized on a sell-through basis). Amounts included in our consolidated financial statements associated with these supply chain and inventory management arrangements with Brightstar were not material.\nFor more information regarding our related party transactions with SoftBank, see Note 2 - Business Combination and Note 14 - SoftBank Equity Transaction of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSupplemental Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Information\nThe following table summarizes T-Mobile\u2019s supplemental cash flow information:\nIndex for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 21 - Subsequent Events\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 14, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $3.0 billion in Senior Notes. A portion of the senior secured term loan commitments were reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Senior Notes, which reduced the commitment to $2.0 billion. See Note 8 - Debt for further information.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on February 1, 2021, the valuation process was complete with respect to Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunication assets used to provide services pursuant to the Management Agreement, for which we previously exercised an option to purchase. The parties are negotiating the remaining outstanding terms of a definitive agreement to govern the purchase of Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunication assets and expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021 after satisfying customary conditions to closing. The base purchase price of the wireless telecommunication assets is $1.9 billion, subject to certain other purchase price adjustments prescribed by the Management Agreement and such additional purchase price adjustments agreed by the parties. See Note 2 - Business Combination for further information.\nSupplementary Data\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe following table includes the impact of the Merger on a prospective basis from the Merger close date of April 1, 2020. Historical results have not been restated and reflect standalone T-Mobile.\nEarnings per share is computed independently for each quarter and the sum of the quarters may not equal earnings per share for the full year. There were no discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.",
    "item_9": "Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.",
    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K.\nThe certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOn April 1, 2020, we completed our Merger with Sprint and have implemented new processes and internal controls to assist us in the preparation and disclosure of financial information. Other than the integration of Sprint, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions, providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization, and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nOn April 1, 2020, we completed our Merger with Sprint and have implemented new processes and internal controls to assist us\nin the preparation and disclosure of financial information. We have also integrated certain Sprint business processes into our existing processes, systems and internal control over financial reporting. Given the significance of the Sprint acquisition and the complexity of systems and business processes, we have excluded certain acquired Sprint processes and internal controls that were not integrated from our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. This exclusion is in accordance with the guidance issued by the SEC that permits registrants to exclude an acquired business from management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting for the first year after the acquisition is completed. The total assets of Sprint, excluding the elements related to processes that have been integrated with our processes, and excluding goodwill, spectrum licenses and other\nidentifiable intangible assets that were subject to our evaluation, represent approximately 14% of consolidated assets as of December 31, 2020. The total revenues of Sprint represent approximately 30% of the consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report herein.",
