    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nBaker Hughes Company (Baker Hughes, the Company, we, us, or our) is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We conduct business in more than 120 countries and employ approximately 68,000 employees. The Company was formed as the result of a combination between Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI) and the oil and gas business (GE O&G) of General Electric Company (GE) (the Transactions), which resulted in GE owning approximately 62.5% of the Company. As a result of the Transactions, substantially all of the business of GE O&G and of Baker Hughes, was transferred to a subsidiary of the Company, Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC (BHGE LLC). As of September 16, 2019, GE ceased to hold more than 50% of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock. Subsequently, on October 17, 2019, the Company changed its name from Baker Hughes, a GE company to Baker Hughes Company. On October 18, 2019, the Company began trading as BKR on the New York Stock Exchange.\nSEPARATION FROM GE\nIn June 2018, GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from Baker Hughes over time. To that end, in November 2018, we completed a secondary public offering in which GE and its affiliates sold 101.2 million shares of our Class A common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by GE and its affiliates. The offering included the exchange by GE and its affiliates of common units of BHGE LLC (LLC Units), together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock, for our Class A common stock. Also, in November 2018, we repurchased 65 million of our Class B common stock, together with an equal number of associated LLC Units, from GE and its affiliates for $1.5 billion. In connection with this repurchase, the corresponding shares of Class B common stock and LLC Units were canceled. As a result of this secondary offering and repurchase, GE's interest in Baker Hughes was reduced from approximately 62.5% to approximately 50.4%.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a Master Agreement and a series of related ancillary agreements and binding term sheets with GE and BHGE LLC (collectively, the Master Agreement Framework, which were later negotiated into definitive agreements) designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaboration between us and GE. The Master Agreement Framework focuses on areas where we work most closely with GE on developing leading technology and executing for customers. First, we defined the parameters for long-term collaboration and partnership with GE on critical rotating equipment technology. Second, for our digital software and technology business we agreed to maintain the status quo as the exclusive supplier of GE Digital oil and-gas applications, although this commercial arrangement was modified pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, discussed below, including by rendering the relationship with GE Digital to be nonexclusive with respect to digital offerings in the oil and gas space. Finally, we reached agreements on a number of other areas including our controls business, pension, taxes, and intercompany services. All agreements within the Master Agreement Framework were finalized by the first quarter of 2019.\nIn July 2019, we also entered into an Omnibus Agreement, a general framework agreement that addresses certain outstanding matters under existing long-term commercial agreements between us and GE. The Omnibus Agreement contains provisions regarding, among other things, (i) the repayment of certain outstanding amounts mutually owed by the parties, (ii) certain employee and assets transfers (including the allocation of costs and expenses associated therewith), and (iii) certain matters related to three international joint ventures. Modifications to the commercial arrangements between us and GE included, among other things, modification of the relationship between BHGE LLC and GE Digital to be nonexclusive with respect to digital offerings in the oil and gas space.\nIn September 2019, we completed another secondary public offering in which GE and its affiliates sold 132.3 million shares of our Class A common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by GE and its affiliates in this offering. The offering included the exchange by GE and its affiliates of LLC Units, together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock, for our Class A common stock. Also, in September 2019, we repurchased 11.9 million shares of our Class B common stock, together with an equal number of associated LLC Units, from GE and its affiliates for $250 million. In connection with this repurchase, the corresponding shares of Class B common stock and LLC Units were canceled. As a result of this secondary offering and repurchase, GE's interest in Baker Hughes was reduced to approximately 36.8%, and therefore, GE ceased to hold more than 50% of\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 1\nthe voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock. As of December 31, 2019, GE's interest in us was 36.7%.\nFor a discussion of certain risks associated with the separation, including risks related to our business, financial condition and results of operations, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Factors Related to the Separation from GE.\u201d For further details on the Master Agreement Framework and Omnibus Agreement, see \"Note 19. Related Party Disclosures\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nOUR VISION\nWe are an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in the current year.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 5\nOur products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive environment varies by product line, as discussed below:\nOilfield Services\nOur OFS segment believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product and service quality, reliability and availability, health, safety and environmental standards, technical proficiency, and price. Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and revenue and earnings are affected by changes in commodity prices, fluctuations in the level of drilling, workover and completion activity in major markets, general economic conditions, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and governmental regulations. While we may have contracts with customers that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period of time ranging from two to four years, our services and products are generally provided on a well-by-well basis. Most contracts cover our pricing of the products and services, but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use our products and services. OFS segment competitors include Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Weatherford International.\nOilfield Equipment\nOur OFE segment believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product and service quality, reliability and on time delivery, health, safety and environmental standards, technical proficiency, availability of spare parts, and price. Its strong track record of innovation enables OFE to enter into long-term, performance-based service agreements with our customers. In the SPS product line, the primary competitors of OFE include Schlumberger, TechnipFMC, Aker Solutions ASA, Proserv, and Dril-Quip Inc. In the flexible pipe product line, competitors include TechnipFMC, National Oilwell Varco (NOV), Airborne, and Magma. In the drilling product line, competitors include NOV and Schlumberger. In the surface pressure control product line, the primary competitors include Cactus Wellhead, TechnipFMC, and Schlumberger.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nOur TPS segment believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product range (or power range measured in megawatts) coverage, efficiency, product reliability and availability, service capabilities, references, emissions, and price. Our primary equipment competitors include Siemens (Power and Gas business unit), Solar (a Caterpillar company), MAN Turbo, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Elliot Ebara. In the valves and pumps product line, competitors include Emerson, Flowserve, Metso and Sulzer. Our aftermarket equipment product line competes with independent service providers such as Masaood John Brown, EthosEnergy, Sulzer, MTU, and Chromalloy.\nDigital Solutions\nOur DS segment believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are superior product technology, service, quality, and reliability. Our DS segment competes across a wide range of industries, including oil & gas, power generation, aerospace, and light and heavy industrials. The products and services are sold in a diversified, fragmented arena with a broad range of competitors. Although no single company competes directly with DS across all its product lines, various companies compete in one or more products. Competitors include Emerson, Honeywell Process Solutions, Olympus, Schneider Electric, and Siemens.\nCONTRACTS\nWe conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments, including fixed-fee or turnkey contracts, transactional agreements for products and services, and long-term aftermarket service agreements.\nWe enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts and master service agreements. Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer\u2019s technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances, such as changes in local laws, or industry or geopolitical events. In some cases, failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims. We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 6\nWe strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices. Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of their employees and often their other contractors; the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment, and often that of their other contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well control, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment; and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while under our control. Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices, we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence, and include an overall limitation of liability clause. It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer contracts.\nOur indemnity structure may not protect us in every case. Certain U.S. states have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract. State law, laws in countries outside the U.S., public policy, or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct. We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products. It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always possible. Similarly, government agencies and other third parties, including in some cases other contractors of our customers, may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault. Deviations from our standard contracting practices are examined through an established risk deviation process.\nThe Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable; however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products, services, technology, and other solutions, as well as the improvement of existing products, services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs. We continue to invest across all operating segments in products to enhance safety, develop capability, improve performance, and reduce costs aligned with our operational strategy. In OFS, we invested in a range of formation evaluation capabilities as well as drilling, completions, and production hardware. In OFE, the recent focus has been to expand capability into deeper water, longer offsets and at higher pressures as well as modular designs that allow for simpler and more integrated subsea systems as with our AptaraTM product line. Additionally, subsea power and processing is also an area in which we are investing, covering both pumping and compression. In TPS, we continue to invest in our latest generation of gas turbines for energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint such as our LM9000TM and Nova LTTM products. DS continues to invest in advanced digital solutions designed to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of oil & gas production operations. These systems integrate operational data and provide analytics from producing oil and gas facilities helping to prevent unplanned downtime and improve facility reliability. In addition, DS invests in a broad range of measurement and control solutions spanning multiple industries, including methane detection systems like LumenTM used for oil and gas operations, and additionally inspection technologies for consumer electronics. Our Enterprise Technology Operations expanded its investments in the fields of additive manufacturing, AI, edge computing, and broader data science capabilities.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 7\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur technology, brands and other intellectual property (IP) rights are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Many patents and patent applications comprise the Baker Hughes portfolio and are owned by us. Other patents and patent applications applicable to our products and services are licensed to us by GE and, in some cases, third parties.

Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations with regard to air, land and water quality and other environmental matters. Regulations continue to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment of new legislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation. Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly.\nWe recognize that environmental challenges including climate change warrant meaningful action. In 2019, we announced our commitment to reduce our carbon equivalent emissions 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. This goal encompasses emissions from our direct operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) as compared to our baseline year of 2012 and was set to align with the Paris Accord and the specific recommendations of the United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5oC. We have proactively worked to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade and continue efforts to reduce our overall environmental footprint by using materials wisely and preserving land, water and air quality. Our sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the UN Global Compact, which commenced in 2019 and requires annual communication of progress. This Compact requires commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and ten principles including a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, initiatives to promote a greater sense of environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies.\nWhile we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business, we are, and may in the future be, involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties, typically related to historical operations. On rare occasions, our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 9\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (known as \"Superfund\") imposes liability for the release of a \"hazardous substance\" into the environment. Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault, even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at various Superfund sites, and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs for the site. PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs.\nIn some cases, it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage, or superfund allocation information is not yet available. Based upon current information, we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations, including remediation obligations, environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost, based on available information, is not expected to be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements. Our total accrual for environmental remediation was $82 million and $84 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our assurance programs.\nAVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION FOR STOCKHOLDERS\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), are made available free of charge on our Internet website at www.bakerhughes.com as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves various risks. When considering an investment in the Company, one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below, as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and matters not listed below, that we are unaware of, or that we currently consider immaterial. Any of these may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in the Company.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment and trained personnel. Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. In order to be competitive, we must provide new technologies, reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers, and successfully recruit, train and retain competent personnel.\nIn addition, our investments in new technologies and properties, plants and equipment may not provide competitive returns. Our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry\u2019s capacity relative to customer demand, and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors\u2019 products and services. Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in various markets in which we operate, or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services, any competitive advantage that we may hold, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are also developing artificial intelligence products and services with a third party. There are no assurances that we will be able to successfully develop an artificial intelligence platform that will effectively address the artificial intelligence related needs of our customers. In addition, the agreement with the third party is subject to term limitations and there are no assurances that a future agreement, if any, will have the same terms as the current agreement.\nThe high cost or unavailability of infrastructure, materials, equipment, supplies and personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials, component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories. Our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business, including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals, control costs, and avoid shortages or over-supply of raw materials and component parts.\nPeople are a key resource to developing, manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world. Our ability to manage the recruiting, training, retention and efficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business. A well-trained, motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business. Periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit, train and retain our employees, while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified labor in the markets where we operate.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 12\nOur business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest, government expropriations and/or epidemic outbreaks.\nGeopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business. Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our or our customers\u2019 ability to conduct operations.\nIn addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks, civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business. Our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest. Epidemic outbreaks may also impact our business operations by, among other things, restricting travel to protect the health and welfare of our employees and decisions by our customers to curtail or stop operations in impacted areas.\nCompliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results. In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.\nWe have operations in the United States and in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. Compliance-related issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings. Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate. In addition, changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws, rules, and regulations that affect our operations. Government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. The continued success of our global business and operations depends, in part, on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political, legal and regulatory risks.\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose risks to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose risks to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data. Cybersecurity attacks also pose risks to our customers\u2019, partners\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and third-party service providers\u2019 products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our and our customers\u2019 data. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, we remain vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. Given our global footprint, the large number of customers with which we do business, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nWe also may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action, fines and penalties.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 13\nOur failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nOur ability to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to successfully manage our agents, distributors and other business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees.\nAnti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us.\nWe maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and geographic locale. These controls establish procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. We cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions, fines, penalties and reputational harm, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws, tax rates, tariffs, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities, and tax audits could impact operating results.\nChanges in tax laws, tax rates, tariffs, changes in interpretation of tax laws, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results, including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization. If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially impacted.\nOur operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses.\nThe products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex, and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers\u2019 costs. In addition, many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries, such as the offshore oilfield business. These hazards include blowouts, explosions, nuclear-related events, fires, collisions, capsizings and severe weather conditions. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards. Our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event, against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompliance with, and rulings and litigation in connection with, environmental and climate change regulations and the environmental and climate change impacts of our or our customers\u2019 operations may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe and our business are impacted by material changes in environmental laws, regulations, rulings and litigation. Our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including (without limitation) our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, are only our forecasts regarding these matters. These forecasts may be substantially different from actual results, which may be affected by factors such as: changes in law that impose restrictions on air emissions, wastewater management, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing, or wetland and land use practices; more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations; a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected, adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party, including (without limitation) Superfund sites; the discovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations; and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 14\nInternational, national, and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. The EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among others, certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry, which in turn may include data from certain of our wellsite equipment and operations. In addition, the U.S. government has proposed rules in the past setting GHG emission standards for, or otherwise aimed at reducing GHG emissions from, the oil and natural gas industry. Caps or fees on carbon emissions, including in the United States, have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossil-fuel energy sector. We are unable to predict whether and when the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they ultimately will require, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business.\nOther developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol; the European Union Emission Trading System; Article 8 of the European Union Energy Efficiency Directive and the United Kingdom\u2019s Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme(ESOS); and, in the United States, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Western Climate Action Initiative, and various state programs implementing the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (known as Assembly Bill 32).\nThe potential for climate related changes may pose future risks to our operations and those of our customers. These changes can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency of severe weather, rising mean temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns. Such changes have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results, particularly at facilities in coastal areas.\nRegulatory requirements related to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) or sustainability reporting have been issued in the European Union that applies to financial market participants, with implementation and enforcement expected in 2021. In the United States, such regulations have been issued related to pension investments in California, and for the responsible investment of public funds in Illinois. Additional regulation is pending in other states. We expect regulatory requirements related to ESG matters to continue to expand globally. The Company is committed to transparent and comprehensive reporting of our sustainability performance, and considers existing standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s G4 guidelines, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\u2019s documentation, International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association's (IPIECA) Sustainability Reporting Guidance and recommendations issued by the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures. If we are not able to meet future sustainability reporting requirements of regulators or current and future expectations of investors, customers or other stakeholders, our business and ability to raise capital may be adversely affected.\nUninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation, as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings. While we have insurance coverage against operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products, to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available; no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation.\nControl of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.\nMuch of the world\u2019s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by state-owned oil companies. State-owned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with state-owned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 15\nProviding services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require us to assume additional risks.\nWe may enter into integrated contracts or turnkey contracts with our customers and we may choose to provide services outside our core business. Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may subject us to additional risks, such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements.\nSome of our customers require bids in the form of fixed pricing contracts.\nSome of our customers require bids for contracts in the form of fixed pricing contracts that may require us to provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business and to act as project managers, as well as service providers, and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost over-runs.\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects which could impose additional costs and obligations on us.\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects. Under such arrangements, each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work, and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed. The failure or inability, financially or otherwise, of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us. These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project, liquidated damages or contract disputes.\nThe credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses.\nHaving a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers. Furthermore, countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices, which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries, particularly national oil companies. Laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming. We will perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers, we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less, or none, of the amounts owed to us by such customer.\nOur Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are subject to modification, termination or reduction of orders, which could negatively impact our sales.\nOur RPO is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services). Our RPO can be significantly affected by the timing of orders for large projects. Although modifications and terminations of orders may be partially offset by cancellation fees, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify orders. Our failure to replace canceled orders could negatively impact our sales and results of operations. The total dollar amount of the Company\u2019s RPO as of December 31, 2019 was $22.9 billion.\nWe may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements.\nOur products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service applications. Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services, which may also include extensive testing requirements. We anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts. In addition, recent scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications. We cannot provide assurance that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 16\nfull-scale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts, or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results.\nFluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business, as well as the costs of doing business of our customers.\nChanges in economic and/or market conditions may impact our ability to borrow and/or cost of borrowing.\nThe condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing, if necessary. If our credit rating is ever downgraded, it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs, as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining, or make it more difficult to renew, obtain or issue new debt financing.\nAn inability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate. Our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. The weakening of protection of our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business.\nWe are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business. Our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain, protect and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized. Without protection for the intellectual property rights we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products. Also, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future, and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms. We would be adversely affected in the event that any such license agreement was terminated without the right for us to continue using the licensed intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated its intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis. Regardless of the merits, any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe effects of Brexit may have a negative impact on our financial results and operations of the business.\nUnited Kingdom has exited (Brexit) the European Union (EU) on January 31, 2020. As per the terms of the exit the UK has ceased to be an EU member but will continue to follow its rules and contribute to its budget for an 11 month transition period ending December 31, 2020. The purpose of the transition period is to give time for the UK and EU to negotiate their future relationship, including a trade deal. There remains significant uncertainty on the outcome of the negotiations and the terms of a future trade deal, if any. This uncertainty could harm our business and financial results due to fluctuations in the value of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar, euro and other currencies. In addition, Brexit could result in delayed deliveries, which may impact our internal supply chain and our customer projects.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 17\nRisk Factors Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nPrices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis. As a result, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending for our products and services. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels.\nDemand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results. Changes in the global economy could impact our customers\u2019 spending levels and our revenue and operating results.\nDemand for oil and natural gas, as well as the demand for our services and products, is highly correlated with global economic growth. A prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset impairments. Such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nRequirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as increased climate change awareness, are likely to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas.\nInternational, national, and state governments, agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and promulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on restricting GHG emissions. These requirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb GHG emissions. In addition, these developments, and public perception relating to climate change, may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind, solar and other renewables. The renewable energy industry is developing enhanced technologies and becoming more competitive with fossil-fuel energy. If renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossil-fuel energy, particularly during periods of higher oil and natural gas prices, it could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nSupply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nProductive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers\u2019 decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells.\nOur customers\u2019 activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets.\nOur customers\u2019 access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices, required investments and resulting returns. Limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow. In addition, a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts.\nSeasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. For example, extreme winter conditions in Canada, Russia or the North Sea may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\u2019 operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 18\nRisk Factors Related to the Separation from GE\nWe may experience challenges relating to the separation from GE and the anticipated benefits from the Master Agreement Framework and the Omnibus Agreement.\nIf we experience difficulties with the separation from GE, the anticipated benefits of the Master Agreement Framework and the Omnibus Agreement, may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, or may be offset by the decrease in business from certain customers or other negative impacts. The impact of the separation from GE could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or other prospects on an ongoing basis.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs in connection with the separation from GE, the Master Agreement Framework and the Omnibus Agreement.\nActual costs related to the separation and the implementation of the changes contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework and the Omnibus Agreement may be higher than anticipated, and we may experience additional difficulties in effecting such changes.\nWe are also a party to a number of licenses with GE that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business. We would be adversely affected in the event these agreements were terminated without the right for us to continue accessing and using such licensed intellectual property as we might continue to improve current products and services or develop new ones.\nAlthough we no longer are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d after the completion of a secondary offering in September 2019, GE and its affiliates continue to own approximately 36.7% of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock, and the interests of GE may differ from the interests of other stockholders of the Company.\nGE and its affiliates are no longer a majority stockholder after the completion of a secondary offering in September 2019. GE may still exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval through its ownership of our Class B common stock, which at December 31, 2019 represented approximately 36.7% of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock. GE may also have influence over matters that do not require stockholder approval. GE may have different interests than other holders of our common stock on these and other matters. Among other things, GE\u2019s influence could delay, defer, or prevent a sale of the Company that other stockholders support, or, conversely, this influence could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other stockholders do not support. This concentrated influence could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire Class A common stock and, as a result, might harm the market price of that Class A common stock. In addition, pursuant to the provisions set forth in our charter, our bylaws and the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated as of November 13, 2018, by and between us and GE, as amended from time to time, the number of individuals who GE is entitled to designate to our board of directors is reduced from five to one. GE will continue to be entitled to designate one person for nomination to our board of directors until such time as GE and its affiliates own less than 20% of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock. Although we are no longer controlled by GE, our success will remain partially dependent on GE through, among other things, our reliance on the long-term agreements and transition services agreements between the Company and GE and the public perception of our affiliation with GE. Failure of GE to comply with these agreements could have an adverse impact on our business operations.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could be materially impacted due to the substantial number of shares of our capital stock eligible for sale in any future offerings by GE.\nGE and its affiliates beneficially owned (assuming full exchange of its shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement) as of December 31, 2019, approximately 36.7% of our outstanding Class A common stock. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, dated July 31, 2019, as further amended from time to time, GE has the right to cause us, in certain instances, at our expense, to register resales of our Class A common stock held by GE under the Securities Act. These shares also may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, subject to restrictions while GE is deemed to be our affiliate. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could substantially decrease the market price of our Class A common stock. We cannot assure you if or when any future offerings or resales of these shares may occur.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 19\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly, our stockholders may be unable to sell their shares of our Class A common stock at or above their purchase price, if at all. We cannot assure our stockholders that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock include: variations in our quarterly operating results; failure to meet our earnings estimates; publication of research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A common stock after the offering; additions or departures of our executive officers and other key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; actions by stockholders; offerings of our Class A common stock by GE or its affiliates or the perceived possibility of such offerings; changes in market valuations of similar companies; speculation in the press or investment community; changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; adverse publicity about our industry generally or individual scandals, specifically; and general market and economic conditions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that might be considered favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by permitting our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations, and placing limitations on convening stockholder meetings. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 20",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nFor management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 please refer to Part II, Item 7 \"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe are an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We conduct business in more than 120 countries and employ approximately 68,000 employees. We operate through our four business segments: Oilfield Services (OFS), Oilfield Equipment (OFE), Turbomachinery & Process Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions (DS).\nWe sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments. Throughout 2019, the industry experienced continued volatility, with North America activity declining versus 2018, and growth internationally. Offshore markets remained relatively stable, with approximately 300 subsea trees being awarded. 2019 was a strong year for liquefied natural gas (LNG) related markets, with 71 million tons per annum of final investment decisions being reached on projects. Lastly, global GDP growth remained healthy throughout 2019, with some headwinds across the power sector.\nIn 2019, we generated revenue of $23,838 million, compared to $22,877 million in 2018. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by increased activity in OFS and OFE partially offset by declines in TPS and DS. Income before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was $753 million in 2019, and included restructuring and impairment charges of $342 million and separation and merger related costs of $184 million. Separation and merger related costs include costs incurred in connection with the separation from GE and the finalization of the Master Agreement Framework. In 2018, loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was $680 million, which also included restructuring and impairment charges of $433 million, and separation and merger related costs of $153 million.\nIn June 2018, GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from us over time. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a Master Agreement Framework which includes a series of related ancillary agreements and binding term sheets (which were later negotiated into definitive agreements) designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaboration between us and GE. The Master Agreement Framework focuses on areas where we work most closely with GE on developing leading technology and executing for customers. First, we defined the parameters for long-term collaboration and partnership with GE on critical rotating equipment technology. Second, for our digital software and technology business we agreed to maintain the status quo as the exclusive supplier of GE Digital oil and-gas applications, although this commercial arrangement was modified pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, discussed below, including by rendering the relationship with GE Digital to be nonexclusive with respect to digital offerings in the oil and gas space. Finally, we reached agreements on a number of other areas including our controls business, pension, taxes, and intercompany services. All agreements within the Master Agreement Framework were finalized by the first quarter of 2019.\nOn July 31, 2019, we also entered into an Omnibus Agreement, a general framework agreement that addresses certain outstanding matters under existing long-term commercial agreements between us and GE. The Omnibus Agreement contains provisions regarding, among other things, (i) the repayment of certain outstanding amounts mutually owed by the parties, (ii) certain employee and assets transfers (including the allocation of costs and expenses associated therewith), and (iii) certain matters related to three international joint ventures. Modifications to the commercial arrangements between us and GE included, among other things, modification of the relationship between BHGE LLC and GE Digital to be nonexclusive with respect to digital offerings in the oil and gas space. For further details on these agreements see \"Note 19. Related Party Transactions\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein. On September 16, 2019, certain equity transactions were\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 27\ncompleted and GE\u2019s ownership of Baker Hughes was reduced from approximately 50.3% to approximately 36.8%. As of December 31, 2019, GE's interest in us was 36.7%.\nIn aggregate, we anticipate that the net financial impact of the agreements contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework will have a slightly negative impact on our operating margin rates of approximately 20 to 40 basis points. In addition, we expect to incur one-time charges related to the separation from GE of approximately $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion over three years. We expect these charges to be primarily related to the build-out of information technology infrastructure as well as customary transaction fees. For a discussion of certain risks associated with separation, including risks related to our business, financial condition and results of operations, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risk Factors Related to the Separation from GE.\u201d\nOUTLOOK\nOur business is exposed to a number of different macro factors, which influence our expectations and outlook. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today, and are subject to change given volatile conditions in the industry.\n\u2022\nNorth America onshore activity: in 2019, we experienced a decline in rig count, as compared to 2018 driven by lower commodity prices over the year. We expect North American onshore activity will continue to decline in 2020. Over the long-term, we remain optimistic about the outlook.\n\u2022\nInternational onshore activity: we have seen a moderate increase in rig count activity in 2019 and expect growth to continue into 2020, albeit at a slower rate. We expect most of the growth to come from Middle East, Latin America and Europe.\n\u2022\nOffshore projects: we have seen stable customer activity and final investment decisions on offshore projects through 2019. We expect the offshore market fundamentals to support another solid year of orders with subsea tree awards in 2020 expected to remain relatively consistent with 2019. We expect to see continued growth in the flexible pipe market, following a strong orders performance in 2019.\n\u2022\nLiquefied natural gas projects: we remain optimistic on the LNG market. While currently oversupplied, we believe a significant number of final investment decisions are needed to fill the projected supply-demand imbalance. In 2019, we have seen multiple large-scale LNG projects reach a positive final investment decision. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive.\n\u2022\nRefinery, petrochemical and industrial projects: in refining, we believe large, complex refineries should gain advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape in 2019 as the industry globalizes and refiners position to meet local demand and secure export potential. The industrial market continues to grow as outdated infrastructure is replaced, policy changes come into effect and power is decentralized. We continue to see growing demand across these markets in 2020.\nWe have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with different industrial metrics such as our Digital Solutions business. Overall, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to compete across the value chain, and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the industry, but are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing assumptions in the near term.\nWhile governments may change or may not continue incentives for renewable energy additions, in the long term, renewables' cost decline may accelerate to compete with new-built fossil capacity. However, we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future.\nDespite the near-term volatility, the long-term outlook for our industry remains positive. We believe the world\u2019s demand for energy will continue to rise, and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity, requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technology from oilfield service companies. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, cost-efficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 28\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes of the Company.\nWe operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nBrent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)\n$\n64.28\n$\n71.34\nWTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)\n56.98\n65.23\nNatural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)\n2.56\n3.15\n(1)\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA) Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\n(2)\nEIA Cushing, OK WTI (West Texas Intermediate) spot price\n(3)\nEIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\nOutside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices. After a volatile fourth quarter of 2018 when oil prices dropped nearly 40%, there was more stability and positive sentiment at the start of 2019. Brent oil prices increased from a low of $53.23/Bbl in January 2019, to a high of $74.94/Bbl in April 2019. However, the average Brent oil prices decreased to $64.28/Bbl in 2019 from $71.34/Bbl in 2018, primarily due to higher prices in the first three quarters of 2018.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which similar to Brent oil prices, on average decreased to $56.98/Bbl in 2019 from $65.23/Bbl in 2018, and ranged from a low of $46.31/Bbl in January 2019, to a high of $66.24/Bbl in April 2019.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $2.56/mmBtu in 2019, representing a 19% decrease over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $4.25/mmBtu in March 2019 to a low of $1.75/mmBtu in December 2019. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2019 was 3,192 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which was 15.3%, or 487 Bcf, above the corresponding week in 2018.\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 29\nother outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019, Ukraine was added to the Baker Hughes international rig count. The Company will continue tracking active drilling rigs in the country going forward. Historical periods will not be updated.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\nNorth America\n1,077\n1,223\nInternational\n1,097\nWorldwide\n2,174\n2,211\n2019 Compared to 2018\nOverall the rig count was 2,174 in 2019, a decrease of 2% as compared to 2018 due primarily to North American activity. The rig count in North America decreased 12% in 2019 compared to 2018, as a result of lower commodity prices and exploration and production capital expenditure reductions. Internationally, the rig count increased 11% in 2019 as compared to the same period last year. Excluding Ukraine, the international rig count was up 6% when compared to the same period last year.\nWithin North America, the decrease was primarily driven by the Canadian rig count, which was down 30% on average when compared to the same period last year, and a decrease in the U.S. rig count, which was down 9% on average. Internationally, the improvement in the rig count was driven primarily by increases in the Europe region of 72%, primarily related to the addition of Ukraine during the second quarter of 2019. Excluding Ukraine, the rig count in the Europe region was up 15%. The Africa region and Middle East region, were also up by 19% and 5%, respectively.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated and combined statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 30\nOur results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following: net interest expense, net other non operating income, corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, inventory impairment, separation and merger related costs, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following:\nVolume: Volume is the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. It also includes price, defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (FX): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation & benefits and overhead costs.\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume & price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations\nOur statement of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which \u201cgoods\u201d is required to include all sales of tangible products and \u201cservices\u201d must include all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between \u201cequipment\u201d and \u201cproduct services,\u201d where product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to \u201cproduct services\u201d simply as \u201cservices\u201d within Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOrders: We recognized orders of $26,973 million and $23,904 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, equipment orders were up 26% and service orders were up 3%, compared to 2018.\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $22.9 billion and $21.0 billion, respectively.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 31\nRevenue and Segment Operating Income Before Tax\nRevenue and segment operating income for each of our four operating segments is provided below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n$ Change\nFrom 2018 to 2019\nRevenue:\nOilfield Services\n$\n12,889\n$\n11,617\n$\n1,272\nOilfield Equipment\n2,921\n2,641\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\n5,536\n6,015\n(479\n)\nDigital Solutions\n2,492\n2,604\n(112\n)\nTotal\n$\n23,838\n$\n22,877\n$\nYear Ended December 31,\n$ Change\nFrom 2018 to 2019\nSegment operating income:\nOilfield Services\n$\n$\n$\nOilfield Equipment\n-\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nDigital Solutions\n(47\n)\nTotal segment operating income\n2,035\n1,796\nCorporate\n(433\n)\n(405\n)\n(28\n)\nInventory impairment and related charges (1)\n-\n(105\n)\nRestructuring, impairment and other\n(342\n)\n(433\n)\nSeparation and merger related\n(184\n)\n(153\n)\n(31\n)\nOperating income\n1,074\nOther non operating income (loss), net\n(84\n)\n(286\n)\nInterest expense, net\n(237\n)\n(223\n)\n(14\n)\nIncome before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate\nEquity in loss of affiliate\n-\n(139\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n(482\n)\n(258\n)\n(224\n)\nNet income\n$\n$\n$\n(12\n)\n(1)\nInventory impairments and related charges are reported in the \"Cost of goods sold\" caption of the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss).\nFiscal Year 2019 to Fiscal Year 2018\nRevenue in 2019 was $23,838 million, an increase of $961 million, or 4%, from 2018. This increase in revenue was largely a result of increased activity in OFS and OFE partially offset by declines in TPS and DS. OFS increased $1,272 million, OFE increased $280 million, TPS decreased $479 million and DS decreased $112 million.\nTotal segment operating income in 2019 was $2,035 million, an increase of $239 million, or 13%, from 2018. The increase was primarily driven by OFS, which increased $132 million, OFE, which increased $55 million and TPS, which increased $98 million, partially offset by DS, which decreased $47 million.\nOilfield Services\nOFS 2019 revenue was $12,889 million, an increase of $1,272 million from 2018, primarily as a result of increased international activity in 2019 compared to 2018. International revenue was $8,293 million in 2019, an increase of $1,386 million from 2018, with faster growth than the international rig count driven by activity in the\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 32\nMiddle East, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. North America revenue was $4,596 million in 2019, a decrease of $114 million from 2018 driven by declining rig counts in North America.\nOFS 2019 segment operating income was $917 million, compared to $785 million in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume and increased cost productivity.\nOilfield Equipment\nOFE 2019 revenue was $2,921 million, an increase of $280 million, or 11%, from 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume in the subsea production systems business and subsea services business. These increases were partially offset by lower volume in the flexible pipe business.\nOFE 2019 segment operating income was $55 million, compared to breakeven in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume and increased cost productivity.\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nTPS 2019 revenue was $5,536 million, a decrease of $479 million, or 8%, from 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower equipment installation volume and business dispositions, partially offset by higher contractual services revenue. Equipment revenue in 2019 represented 36% and Service revenue represented 64% of total revenue.\nTPS 2019 segment operating income was $719 million, compared to $621 million in 2018. The increase in profitability was driven primarily by higher cost productivity and favorable business mix.\nDigital Solutions\nDS 2019 revenue was $2,492 million, a decrease of $112 million, or 4%, from 2018, driven primarily by lower volume in Bentley, controls, pipeline and process solutions, and software businesses, partially offset by higher volume in the measurement & sensing business.\nDS 2019 segment operating income was $343 million, compared to $390 million in 2018. The decrease in profitability was driven by lower volume and negative cost productivity.\nCorporate\nIn 2019, corporate expenses were $433 million, an increase of $28 million compared to 2018, primarily from the additional expenses related to the separation from GE.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other\nIn 2019, we recognized $342 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges, a decrease of $91 million compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the accelerated amortization costs in 2018 that did not repeat in 2019, and reduced integration related restructuring activities partially offset by additional charges in our OFS segment focused on supply chain optimization, improving asset utilization, and driving down product and service delivery costs.\nSeparation and Merger related\nWe recorded $184 million of separation and merger related costs in 2019, an increase of $31 million from the prior year. Costs in 2019 primarily relate to the finalization of the Master Agreement Framework and the ongoing activities related to the separation from GE. In 2018, separation and merger related costs primarily included costs associated with the integration of BHI.\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn 2019, we incurred net interest expense of $237 million, an increase of $14 million from the prior year, primarily driven by costs associated with refinancing our Senior Notes due August 2021 and lower interest income.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 33\nEquity in Loss of Affiliate\nAs we have discontinued applying the equity method on our investment in BJ Services, we did not record any gain or loss during 2019 compared to a loss of $139 million in 2018. We will resume application of the equity method only after our share of unrecognized net income equals our share of net loss not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended.\nIncome Tax\nIn 2019, our income tax expense increased by $224 million, from $258 million in 2018 to $482 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher foreign taxes related to increased foreign earnings and geographical mix of earnings.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe, in the conduct of all of our activities, are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical and quality standards (Standards) as also reported in our Quality Management System (QMS). We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. To ensure that we live up to our high Standards, we devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program (Compliance Program) which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond in a timely fashion to any potential violations of the law, Our Way: The Baker Hughes Code of Conduct, and other Company policies and procedures.\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\n\u2022\nComprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations to government officials and other parties; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, there are policies and procedures to address customs requirements, visa processing risks, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-boycott laws.\n\u2022\nGlobal structure of Legal Compliance Counsel and other professionals providing compliance advice, customized training and governance, as well as investigating concerns across all regions and countries where we do business.\n\u2022\nComprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis.\n\u2022\nDue diligence procedures for third parties who conduct business on our behalf, including commercial sales agents, administrative service providers, and professional consultants, as well as an enhanced risk-based process for classifying channel partners and suppliers.\n\u2022\nDue diligence procedures for merger and acquisition activities.\n\u2022\nSpecifically tailored compliance risk assessments and audits focused on country and third party risk.\n\u2022\nCompliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as Product Company and regional compliance committees that meet quarterly.\n\u2022\nTechnology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a web-based anti-boycott reporting tool, global trade management systems and comprehensive watch list screening.\n\u2022\nA compliance program designed to create an \u201cOpen Reporting Environment\u201d where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in approximately 150 languages.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 34\n\u2022\nCentralized finance organization with company-wide policies.\n\u2022\nAnti-corruption audits of high-risk countries conducted by Legal Compliance and Internal Audit, as well as risk-based compliance audits of third parties conducted by Legal Compliance.\n\u2022\nWe have region-specific processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion into select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire compliance training module for all employees.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,249 million compared to $3,723 million at December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents includes $162 million and $747 million of cash held on behalf of GE at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nExcluding cash held on behalf of GE, our U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion of our cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., they will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.\nIn December 2019, BHGE LLC entered into a $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2019 Credit Agreement) with commercial banks maturing in December 2024. The 2019 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, BHGE LLC's obligations under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2019 Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. In connection with BHGE LLC\u2019s entry into the 2019 Credit Agreement, BHGE LLC terminated its then-existing five-year committed $3 billion revolving credit agreement dated as of July 3, 2017 (the 2017 Credit Agreement). During 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2019 or 2017 Credit Agreement.\nBHGE LLC has a commercial paper program under which it may issue from time to time up to $3 billion in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. At December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program.\nIf market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility. However, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs and restructuring costs, capital expenditures, the repayment of debt, payment of dividends, distributions to GE and share repurchases. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 35\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n(In millions)\nOperating activities\n$\n2,126\n$\n1,762\nInvesting activities\n(1,045\n)\n(578\n)\nFinancing activities\n(1,534\n)\n(4,363\n)\nFiscal Year 2019 to Fiscal Year 2018\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of goods and services.\nCash flows from operating activities generated cash of $2,126 million and $1,762 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased $364 million in 2019 primarily driven by improved operating performance. These cash inflows were supported by $553 million of working capital generation mainly due to net positive progress collections and receivables in TPS for equipment contracts, as well as continued improvement in our working capital processes. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2019 and 2018 are payments of $307 million and $473 million, respectively, made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and separation and merger related costs including the build-out of information technology infrastructure as a result of GE separation activities.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $1,045 million and $578 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $1,240 million and $995 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $264 million and $458 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lost-in-hole, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period. In 2019, we received $77 million from the sale of our high-speed reciprocating compression business. In 2018, we received $453 million from the sale of businesses primarily driven by the sale of our Natural Gas Solution (NGS) business for $375 million. Also in 2018, the Company and ADNOC signed a strategic partnership agreement under which we acquired a five percent stake in ADNOC Drilling for a cash consideration of $500 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities used cash of $1,534 million and $4,363 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDuring 2019, we paid aggregate dividends of $395 million to our Class A stockholders, and BHGE LLC made a distribution of $350 million to GE. Additionally, in September 2019, BHGE LLC repurchased 11.9 million Units from GE for a cash consideration of $250 million. In total, we returned $995 million of cash to our shareholders through share buybacks, dividends to our Class A stockholders and distributions to GE.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 36\nDuring 2018, we paid aggregate dividends of $315 million to our Class A stockholders, and BHGE LLC made a distribution of $495 million to GE. We used cash of $387 million and $638 million, respectively, to repurchase and cancel our shares of Class A and Class B common stock and corresponding paired Units in BHGE LLC, on a pro rata basis. Additionally, in November 2018, BHGE LLC repurchased 65 million Units from GE for a cash consideration of $1,461 million. In total, we returned $3.3 billion of cash to our shareholders through share buybacks, dividends to our Class A stockholders and distributions to GE.\nWe had net repayments of short-term debt of $542 million and $376 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Repayment of our long-term debt of $570 million and $684 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, consisted primarily of repayment of certain Senior Notes.\nIn November 2019, BHGE LLC issued $525 million of 3.138% Senior Notes due November 2029. We used the proceeds from this offering to repurchase all of our outstanding 3.2% Senior Notes due August 2021.\nCash Requirements\nIn 2020, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. When necessary, we issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. Based on current market conditions, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from disposal of assets, in 2020 will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $500 million to $600 million in 2020.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\nPayments Due by Period\n(In millions)\nTotal\nLess Than\n1 Year\n1 - 3\nYears\n4 - 5\nYears\nMore Than\n5 Years\nTotal debt and finance lease obligations (1)\n$\n6,410\n$\n$\n1,314\n$\n$\n4,624\nEstimated interest payments (2)\n3,609\n2,497\nOperating leases (3)\n1,020\nPurchase obligations (4)\n1,571\n1,304\nTotal\n$\n12,610\n$\n2,089\n$\n2,331\n$\n$\n7,454\n(1)\nAmounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including finance lease obligations. Amounts for debt do not include any deferred issuance costs or unamortized discounts or premiums including step up in the value of the debt on the acquisition of BHI. Expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts. Total debt and finance lease obligations includes $273 million payable to GE and its affiliates. As there is no fixed payment schedule on the amount payable to GE and its affiliates we have classified it as payable in less than one year.\n(2)\nAmounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and finance lease obligations.\n(3)\nAmounts represent the future minimum payments under operating leases with initial terms of one year or more. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 37\n(4)\nPurchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2020 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $573 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See \"Note 13. Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe have certain defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. and international employees. During 2019, we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately $39 million in connection with those plans, and we anticipate funding approximately $32 million during 2020. Amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change, therefore, we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2020. See \"Note 12. Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than those discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nRegistration Statements: In November 2018, Baker Hughes filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, guarantees of debt securities, purchase contracts and units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in 2021.\nIn December 2017, BHGE LLC and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to have the ability to sell up to $3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. The specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in December 2020.\nCustomer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2019, 19% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States. Other than the United States, no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross trade receivables at this date. As of December 31, 2018, 24% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United States.\nInternational operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S., is 88% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2019. We may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 38\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAccounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Many of these estimates include determining fair value. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles and longlived assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated and combined financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our TPS segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of 15 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates.\nRevenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review.\nThe difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset (revenue in excess of billings) or a contract liability (billings in excess of revenue). See \"Note 8. Contract and Other Deferred Assets\" and \"Note 9. Progress Collections and Deferred Income\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.\nWe regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 39\nthrough supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement\u2019s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $(1) million, $26 million and $44 million for the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident.\nOn December 31, 2019, our long-term product service agreements, net of related billings in excess of revenues, of $0.3 billion, represent approximately 2.9% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $10.3 billion. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 17% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1% would increase or decrease the long-term product service agreements balance by $0.04 billion.\nGoodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually using data as of July 1 of that year. The impairment test consists of two different steps: in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value, in step two, which is applied only when the carrying value is more than its fair value, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill. We determine fair values of each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed.\nPension Assumptions\nPension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits, lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 2.34% and 3.43%, respectively, reflecting market interest rates. Our expected return on assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 5.48% and 5.94%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and the GAAP in these various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management\u2019s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. However, as a result of U.S. tax reform, substantially all of our 2017 and prior unrepatriated foreign earnings were subject to U.S. tax and, accordingly, we expect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without incremental U.S. federal tax. As of December 31, 2019, the cumulative amount of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings is approximately $6.7\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 40\nbillion. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform) that lowers the statutory tax rate on U.S. earnings, taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from U.S. taxation at a reduced rate of tax (transition tax), establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations.\nThe impact of U.S. tax reform was initially recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provided for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on several provisions, including the computation of the transition tax. Based on guidance received to date, finalization of purchase accounting for the BHI acquisition and finalization of our 2017 U.S. income tax returns, we have recorded a $107 million tax benefit in 2018 for the impact of tax reform primarily related to the revaluation of deferred taxes.\nAdditionally, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on \"base eroding\" payments from the U.S. and a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low-taxed income). We have made an accounting policy election to account for these taxes as period costs.\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $451 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2019. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.\nOther Loss Contingencies\nOther loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments.\nThe preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 41\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $323 million and $327 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions, however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, inventory reserves totaled $429 million and $430 million of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required.\nAcquisitions-Purchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories, identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nSee \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of accounting standards to be adopted.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSee \"Note 19. Related Party Transactions\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of related party transactions.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 42\nOTHER ITEMS\nBrexit\nUnited Kingdom has exited (Brexit) the European Union (EU) on January 31, 2020. As per the terms of the exit the UK has ceased to be an EU member but will continue to follow its rules and contribute to its budget for an 11 month transition period ending December 31, 2020. The purpose of the transition period is to give time for the UK and EU to negotiate their future relationship, including a trade deal. There remains significant uncertainty on the outcome of the negotiations and the terms of a future trade deal, if any.\nAlthough our customer base is global with predominant exposure to the U.S. dollar, we have a manufacturing and service base in the UK with some euro procurement, thus we are exposed to fluctuations in value of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar, euro and other currencies. We have a hedging program which looks to accommodate this potential volatility.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K, including MD&A and certain statements in the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a \"forward-looking statement\"). Forward-looking statements concern future circumstances and results and other statements that are not historical facts and are sometimes identified by the words \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"potential,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"endeavor,\" \"seek,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"overestimate,\" \"underestimate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"project,\" \"predict,\" \"continue,\" \"target\" or other similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements are based upon current plans, estimates and expectations that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The inclusion of such statements should not be regarded as a representation that such plans, estimates or expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans, estimates or expectations include, among others, the risk factors in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Part 1 of Item 1A of this Form 10-K and those set forth from time-to-time in other filings by the Company with the SEC. These documents are available through our website or through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval (EDGAR) system at http://www.sec.gov.\nIn light of such risks and uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

We do not intend to, and disclaim any obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statements unless required by securities law.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. A discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 43\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nAll of our long-term debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments. We are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio. We may use interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.\n(In millions)\nThereafter\nTotal (2)\nAs of December 31, 2019\nLong-term debt (1)\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n1,250\n$\n-\n$\n$\n4,606\n$\n5,963\nWeighted average interest rates\n-\n%\n-\n%\n2.88\n%\n-\n%\n4.06\n%\n3.82\n%\n3.64\n%\n(1)\nFair market value of our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019.\n(2)\nAmounts represent the principal value of our long-term debt outstanding and related weighted average interest rates at the end of the respective period.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK\nWe conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies, and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency. As such, future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies.\nAdditionally, we buy, manufacture and sell components and products across global markets. These activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses. When the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates, it will affect the revenue earned on the sale. These sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates. Changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing. We use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures, where appropriate.\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts. We had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with net notional amounts aggregating $1.8 billion and $2.8 billion to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates that a 1% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar would result in an impact of less than $5 million to our pre-tax earnings, however, the Company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure, where there are liquid financial markets, through use of foreign currency derivative transactions. Also, see \"Note 17.

    "item_8": "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. This conclusion is based on the recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal control. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nKPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n/s/ LORENZO SIMONELLI\nLorenzo Simonelli\nChairman, President and\nChief Executive Officer\n/s/ BRIAN WORRELL\nBrian Worrell\nChief Financial Officer\n/s/ KURT CAMILLERI\nKurt Camilleri\nSenior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 13, 2020\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 45\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nBaker Hughes Company:\nOpinion on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Baker Hughes Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated and combined statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated and combined financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated and combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 13, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated and combined financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and combined financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and combined financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and combined financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated and combined financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated and combined financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated and combined financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated and combined financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated and combined financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of revenue recognition on agreements for sales of goods manufactured to unique customer specifications\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, the Company enters into agreements for sales of goods manufactured to unique customer specifications. Revenue from these types of contracts is recognized to the extent of progress towards completion measured by actual costs incurred relative to total expected costs.\nWe identified revenue recognition for contracts from the sales of goods manufactured to unique customer specifications as a critical audit matter because of the complex auditor judgment required in evaluating the Company's long-term estimates of the expected costs to be incurred in order to complete the contract.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 46\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process for contracts from the sales of goods manufactured to unique customer specifications. Such controls included controls pertaining to the Company's estimation of costs expected to be incurred to complete the contract. We selected certain contracts from the sales of goods manufactured to unique customer specifications to evaluate the Company's ability to accurately estimate costs expected to be incurred to complete a contract. For the selected contracts, we evaluated the estimated costs expected to be incurred to complete the contract by:\n-\nquestioning the Company's finance and project managers regarding progress to date based on the latest project reports and the costs expected to still be incurred until completion;\n-\nobserving project review meetings performed by the Company and inspecting relevant minutes of those meetings to identify changes in the estimated costs expected to be incurred to complete the contract and related contract margins;\n-\nassessing the remaining estimated costs expected to be incurred by expenditure category on contracts in progress by comparing to the actual costs incurred during the current year for the selected project and similar projects; and\n-\ninvestigating changes to the contract margin when compared to the prior year's estimated contract margin.\nAssessment of the carrying value of goodwill in the Oilfield Equipment and Oilfield Services reporting units\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, the Company has four reporting units which are monitored for impairment on the basis of market condition. The Company performs a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis on July 1 or whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might exceed its fair value. The goodwill balance as of December 31, 2019 was $20,690 million, of which $3,319 million and $13,043 million were related to the Oilfield Equipment and Oilfield Services reporting units, respectively. The Oilfield Equipment and Oilfield Services reporting units had fair values that were not significantly in excess of their carrying values. Projected revenue, projected operating profit, and the discount rates are elements of the estimated future cash flows used by the Company in determining the fair value of each reporting unit.\nWe identified the evaluation of projected revenue, projected operating profit and the discount rates used in the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill for the Oilfield Equipment and Oilfield Services reporting units as a critical audit matter. Specifically, the evaluation of projected revenue, projected operating profit, and the discount rates required the application of subjective auditor judgement because these projections involve assumptions about future events and changes to the discount rate assumptions may have a significant effect on the Company's assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill of the reporting units.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s goodwill impairment process, including controls over the development of projected financial information and the discount rates, and management\u2019s review of the projections and comparison to historical results. We evaluated the projected revenue and projected operating profit assumptions by comparing the projected amounts to (a) the past performance of the reporting unit, including historical results and growth rates, and (b) relevant and reliable industry benchmark data related to future events. We also considered evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. We evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to accurately prepare projections by comparing the projected revenues and projected operating profit to historical results for the same period. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n-\nevaluating the industry benchmark data used by the Company in developing its projected financial information;\n-\nevaluating the discount rates used by comparing them against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities; and\n-\nperforming sensitivity analysis related to key inputs including revenue growth rates, discount rates and projected operating profit.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2017.\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 13, 2020\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 47\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nBaker Hughes Company:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Baker Hughes Company and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated and combined statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated and combined financial statements), and our report dated February 13, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated and combined financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 13, 2020\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 48\nBAKER HUGHES COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS)\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue:\nSales of goods\n$\n13,689\n$\n13,113\n$\n11,062\nSales of services\n10,149\n9,764\n6,117\nTotal revenue\n23,838\n22,877\n17,179\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of goods sold\n11,798\n11,524\n9,486\nCost of services sold\n7,608\n7,367\n4,657\nSelling, general and administrative\n2,832\n2,699\n2,535\nRestructuring, impairment and other\nSeparation and merger related\nTotal costs and expenses\n22,764\n22,176\n17,463\nOperating income (loss)\n1,074\n(284\n)\nOther non operating income (loss), net\n(84\n)\nInterest expense, net\n(237\n)\n(223\n)\n(131\n)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate\n(335\n)\nEquity in loss of affiliate\n-\n(139\n)\n(11\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n(482\n)\n(258\n)\n(45\n)\nNet income (loss)\n(391\n)\nLess: Net income attributable to GE O&G pre-merger\n-\n-\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(330\n)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Baker Hughes Company\n$\n$\n$\n(103\n)\nPer share amounts:\nBasic income (loss) per Class A common share\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.46\n$\n(0.24\n)\nDiluted income (loss) per Class A common share\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.45\n$\n(0.24\n)\nCash dividend per Class A common share\n$\n0.72\n$\n0.72\n$\n0.35\nSpecial dividend per Class A common share\n$\n17.50\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 49\nBAKER HUGHES COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n$\n$\n(391\n)\nLess: Net income attributable to GE O&G pre-merger\n-\n-\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(330\n)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Baker Hughes Company\n(103\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss):\nInvestment securities\n(3\n)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n(502\n)\n(14\n)\nCash flow hedges\n(4\n)\nBenefit plans\n(75\n)\n(64\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n(8\n)\n(573\n)\nLess: Other comprehensive loss attributable to GE O&G pre-merger\n-\n-\n(69\n)\nLess: Other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(1\n)\n(343\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Baker Hughes Company\n(7\n)\n(230\n)\nComprehensive income (loss)\n(290\n)\n(334\n)\nLess: Comprehensive loss attributable to GE O&G pre-merger\n-\n-\n(27\n)\nLess: Comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(255\n)\n(250\n)\nComprehensive income (loss) attributable to Baker Hughes Company\n$\n$\n(35\n)\n$\n(57\n)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 50\nBAKER HUGHES COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nDecember 31,\n(In millions, except par value)\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents (1)\n$\n3,249\n$\n3,723\nCurrent receivables, net\n6,416\n5,969\nInventories, net\n4,608\n4,620\nAll other current assets\nTotal current assets\n15,222\n14,971\nProperty, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation\n6,240\n6,228\nGoodwill\n20,690\n20,717\nOther intangible assets, net\n5,381\n5,719\nContract and other deferred assets\n1,881\n1,894\nAll other assets\n3,001\n1,838\nDeferred income taxes\n1,072\nTotal assets (1)\n$\n53,369\n$\n52,439\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n4,268\n$\n4,025\nShort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt (1)\nProgress collections and deferred income\n2,870\n1,765\nAll other current liabilities\n2,555\n2,288\nTotal current liabilities\n10,014\n9,020\nLong-term debt\n6,301\n6,285\nDeferred income taxes\nLiabilities for pensions and other employee benefits\n1,079\n1,018\nAll other liabilities\n1,425\nEquity:\nClass A common stock, $0.0001 par value -

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\nBaker Hughes Company (Baker Hughes, the Company, we, us, or our) is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We conduct business in more than 120 countries and employ approximately 68,000 employees. The Company was formed as the result of a combination between Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI) and the oil and gas business (GE O&G) of General Electric Company (GE). As of September 16, 2019, GE ceased to hold more than 50% of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock. Subsequently, on October 17, 2019, the Company changed its name from Baker Hughes, a GE company to Baker Hughes Company. On October 18, 2019, the Company began trading as BKR on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. and such principles, U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for annual financial information. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nOn July 3, 2017, we closed the business combination (the Transactions) of GE O&G and BHI. As a result, substantially all of the businesses of GE O&G and of BHI were transferred to a subsidiary of the Company, Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC (BHGE LLC). Following the Transactions, we held a minority economic interest in BHGE LLC. However, we conducted and exercised full control over all activities of BHGE LLC without the approval of any other member. Accordingly, we consolidated the financial results of BHGE LLC and reported a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated and combined financial statements for the economic interest in BHGE LLC not held by us.\nThe Company's financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis, effective July 3, 2017. Under this basis of presentation, our financial statements consolidate all of our subsidiaries (entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest). For all periods prior to July 3, 2017, the Company's financial statements were prepared on a combined basis. The combined financial statements combine certain accounts of GE and its subsidiaries that were historically managed as part of its oil & gas business and contributed to BHGE LLC as part of the Transactions. Additionally, it also includes certain assets, liabilities and results of operations of other businesses of GE that were also contributed to BHGE LLC as part of the Transactions on a fully retrospective basis (in accordance with the guidance applicable to transactions between entities under common control) based on their carrying values, as reflected in the accounting records of GE. The consolidated and combined statements of income reflect intercompany expense allocations made to us by GE for certain corporate functions and for shared services provided by GE. Where possible, these allocations were made on a specific identification basis, and in other cases, these expenses were allocated by GE based on relative percentages of net operating costs or some other basis depending on the nature of the allocated cost. See \"Note 19. Related Party Transactions\" for further information on expenses allocated by GE. The historical financial results in the consolidated and combined financial statements presented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had GE O&G operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during those periods.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership interest in BHGE LLC and certain intercompany and tax related balances. BHGE LLC is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Registrant with separate filing requirements with the SEC and its separate financial information can be obtained from www.sec.gov. The 2019 and 2018 results may not be comparable to 2017 as the 2017 results include the results of BHI from July 3, 2017 forward.\nIn the Company's financial statements and notes, certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. In the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements, all dollar and share amounts in tabulations are in millions of dollars and shares, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Certain columns and rows in our financial statements and notes thereto may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 54\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nSEPARATION FROM GE\nIn June 2018, GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from Baker Hughes over time. To that end, in November 2018, we completed a secondary public offering in which GE and its affiliates sold 101.2 million shares of our Class A common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by GE and its affiliates. The offering included the exchange by GE and its affiliates of common units of BHGE LLC (LLC Units), together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock, for our Class A common stock. Also, in November 2018, we repurchased 65 million of our Class B common stock, together with an equal number of associated LLC Units, from GE and its affiliates for $1.5 billion. In connection with this repurchase, the corresponding shares of Class B common stock and LLC Units were canceled. As a result of this secondary offering and repurchase, GE's interest in Baker Hughes was reduced from approximately 62.5% to approximately 50.4%.\nIn September 2019, we completed a secondary public offering in which GE and its affiliates sold 132.3 million shares of our Class A common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by GE and its affiliates in this offering. The offering included the exchange by GE and its affiliates of LLC Units, together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock, for our Class A common stock. Also, in September 2019, we repurchased 11.9 million shares of our Class B common stock, together with an equal number of associated LLC Units, from GE and its affiliates for $250 million. In connection with this repurchase, the corresponding shares of Class B common stock and LLC Units were canceled. As a result of this secondary offering and repurchase, GE's interest in Baker Hughes was reduced to approximately 36.8%, and therefore, GE ceased to hold more than 50% of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock. As of December 31, 2019, GE's interest in us was 36.7%.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets or liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty, and accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory valuation reserves; recoverability of long-lived assets, including revenue recognition on long-term contracts, valuation of goodwill; useful lives used in depreciation and amortization; income taxes and related valuation allowances; accruals for contingencies; actuarial assumptions to determine costs and liabilities related to employee benefit plans; stock-based compensation expense; valuation of derivatives and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions; and expense allocations for certain corporate functions and shared services provided by GE.\nForeign Currency\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated into U.S. dollars using our period end exchange rates, and revenue, expenses, and cash flows have been translated at average rates for the respective periods. Any resulting translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income (loss).\nGains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables in the non-functional currency and those resulting from remeasurements of monetary items, are included in the consolidated and combined statement of income (loss).\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 55\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nRevenue from Sale of Equipment\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time\nWe recognize revenue on agreements for sales of goods manufactured to unique customer specifications including long-term construction projects, on an over time basis utilizing cost inputs as the measurement criteria in assessing the progress toward completion. Our estimate of costs to be incurred to fulfill our promise to a customer is based on our history of manufacturing similar assets for customers and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or pricing of the inputs. We begin to recognize revenue on these contracts when the contract specific inventory becomes customized for a customer, which is reflective of our initial transfer of control of the incurred costs. We provide for potential losses on any of these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.\nOur billing terms for these over time contracts vary, but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point In Time\nWe recognize revenue for non-customized equipment at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good. Equipment for which we recognize revenue at a point in time include goods we manufacture on a standardized basis for sale to the market. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics associated with the shipment, whereas the delivery of other equipment is generally determined based on historical data of transit times between regions.\nOn occasion we sell products with a right of return. We use our accumulated experience to estimate and provide for such returns when we record the sale. In situations where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the goods and that acceptance is likely to occur.\nOur billing terms for these point in time equipment contracts vary, but are generally based on shipment of the goods to the customer.\nRevenue from Sale of Services\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time\nWe sell product services under long-term product maintenance or extended warranty agreements in our Turbomachinery & Process Solutions and Oilfield Equipment segments. These agreements require us to maintain the customers' assets over the service agreement contract terms, which generally range from 10 to 20 years. In general, these are contractual arrangements to provide services, repairs, and maintenance of a covered unit (gas turbines for mechanical drive or power generation, primarily on LNG applications, drilling rigs). These services are performed at various times during the life of the contract, thus the costs of performing services are incurred on other than a straight-line basis. We recognize related sales based on the extent of our progress toward completion measured by actual costs incurred in relation to total expected costs. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on any of these agreements when that loss is probable. The Company utilizes historical customer data, prior product performance data, statistical analysis, third-party data, and internal management estimates to calculate contract-specific margins. In certain contracts, the total transaction price is variable based on customer utilization, which is excluded from the contract margin until the period that the customer has utilized to appropriately reflect the revenue activity in the period earned. In addition, revenue for certain oilfield services is recognized on an over time basis as performed.\nOur billing terms for these contracts are generally based on asset utilization (i.e. usage per hour) or the occurrence of a major maintenance event within the contract. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 56\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point In Time\nWe sell certain tangible products, largely spare equipment, through our services business. We recognize revenues for this equipment at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is at the point in time we deliver the spare part to the customer. Our billing terms for these point in time service contracts vary, but are generally based on shipment of the goods to the customer.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and relate to the research and development of new products and services. These costs amounted to $687 million, $700 million and $501 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Research and development expenses were reported in cost of goods sold and cost of services sold.\nSeparation and Merger Related\nSeparation and merger related costs primarily include costs incurred in connection with the separation from GE and the finalization of the Master Agreement Framework and Omnibus Agreement. See \"Note 19. Related Party Transactions\" for further information on the Master Agreement Framework.\nPrior to 2019, separation and merger related costs primarily include costs associated with the combination of BHI and GE O&G. Such costs include professional fees of advisors and integration and synergy costs related to the combination of BHI and GE O&G.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nShort-term investments with original maturities of three months or less are included in cash equivalents unless designated as available-for-sale and classified as investment securities.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $1,102 million and $1,208 million, respectively, of cash held in bank accounts that cannot be released, transferred or otherwise converted into a currency that is regularly transacted internationally, due to lack of market liquidity, capital controls or similar monetary or exchange limitations limiting the flow of capital out of the jurisdiction. These funds are available to fund operations and growth in these jurisdictions and we do not currently anticipate a need to transfer these funds to the U.S. Included in these amounts are $142 million and $461 million, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, held on behalf of GE.\nCash and cash equivalents includes a total of $162 million and $747 million of cash at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, held on behalf of GE, and a corresponding liability is reported in short-term borrowings. See \"Note 19. Related Party Transactions\" for further details.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on various factors including the payment history and financial condition of our debtors and the economic environment. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the debtor accounts or when it becomes evident that the debtor will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nWe grant credit to our customers who primarily operate in the oil and natural gas industry. Although this concentration affects our overall exposure to credit risk, our current receivables are spread over a diverse group of customers across many countries, which mitigates this risk. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers' financial conditions, including monitoring our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to manage this risk. We do not generally require collateral in support of our current receivables, but we may require payment in advance or security in the form of a letter of credit or a bank guarantee.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 57\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nInventories\nAll inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable values and they are measured on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis or average cost basis. As necessary, we record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment (PP&E)\nProperty, plant and equipment is initially stated at cost and is depreciated over its estimated economic life. Subsequently, property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. We manufacture a substantial portion of our tools and equipment in our OFS segment and the cost of these items, which includes direct and indirect manufacturing costs, is capitalized and carried in inventory until it is completed.\nOther Intangible Assets\nWe amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. The cost of intangible assets is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated economic life. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In these circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and written down to fair value as required. Refer to the Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets accounting policy.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets\nWe perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill. However, if the assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value, which is generally calculated using a combination of market, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow approaches. See \"Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" for further information on valuation methodology and impairment of goodwill.\nWe review PP&E, intangible assets and certain other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. When testing for impairment, we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash and equivalents, current receivables, investments, accounts payables, short and long-term debt, and derivative financial instruments.\nWe monitor our exposure to various business risks including commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates and we regularly use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. At the inception of a new\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 58\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nderivative, we designate the derivative as a hedge or we determine the derivative to be undesignated as a hedging instrument. We document the relationships between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. We assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item at both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.\nWe have a program that utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to have gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the foreign currency transaction and translation gains or losses to the extent practical. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from changes in the value of assets (for example, current receivables) and liabilities (for example, current payables) which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity. We record all derivatives as of the end of our reporting period in our consolidated statement of financial position at fair value. For the forward contracts held as undesignated hedging instruments, we record the changes in fair value of the forward contracts in our consolidated and combined statements of income (loss) along with the change in the fair value, related to foreign exchange movements, of the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nFair Value Measurements\nFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date.\nObservable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. Preference is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\n\u2022\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n\u2022\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\n\u2022\nLevel 3 - Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\nWe maintain policies and procedures to value instruments using the best and most relevant data available. In addition, we perform reviews to assess the reasonableness of the valuations. With regard to Level 3 valuations (including instruments valued by third parties), we perform a variety of procedures to assess the reasonableness of the valuations. Such reviews include an evaluation of instruments whose fair value change exceeds predefined thresholds (and/or does not change) and consider the current interest rate, currency and credit environment, as well as other published data, such as rating agency market reports and current appraisals.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nDerivatives\nWhen we have Level 1 derivatives, which are traded either on exchanges or liquid over-the-counter markets, we use closing prices for valuation. The majority of our derivatives are valued using internal models and are included in Level 2. These internal models maximize the use of market observable inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent foreign currency and commodity forward contracts for the Company.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 59\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\nWhen available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment securities, and they are included in Level 1. Level 1 securities primarily include publicly traded equity securities.\nFor investment securities for which market prices are observable for identical or similar investment securities but not readily accessible for each of those investments individually (that is, it is difficult to obtain pricing information for each individual investment security at the measurement date), we use pricing models that are consistent with what other market participants would use. The inputs and assumptions to the models are derived from market observable sources including: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market-related data. Thus, certain securities may not be priced using quoted prices, but rather determined from market observable information. These investments are included in Level 2. When we use valuations that are based on significant unobservable inputs we classify the investment securities in Level 3.\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. These assets can include long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, equity securities without readily determinable fair value and equity method investments and long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nInvestments in equity securities (of entities in which we do not have either a controlling financial interest or significant influence, most often because we hold a voting interest of 0% to 20%) with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings and reported in the \"other non operating income, net\" caption in the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss). Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar equity securities of the same issuer.\nAssociated companies are entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence, most often because we hold a voting interest of 20% to 50%. Associated companies are accounted for as equity method investments. The results of associated companies are presented in the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss) as follows: (i) if the associated company is integral to our operations, their results are included in \"Selling, general and administrative,\" (ii) if the associated company is not integral to our operations, their results are included in \"Other non operating income, net,\" and (iii) our equity method investment in BJ Services, which is a U.S. limited liability corporation, is presented in \"Equity in loss of affiliate.\" Investments in, and advances to, associated companies are presented on a one-line basis in the caption \"All other assets\" in our consolidated statement of financial position.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file U.S. federal and state income tax returns which after the closing of the Transactions primarily includes our distributive share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of BHGE LLC which is treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. As such, BHGE LLC will not itself be subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws. Non-U.S. current and deferred income taxes owed by the subsidiaries of BHGE LLC are reflected in the financial statements.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 60\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nPrior to the closing of the Transactions, GE O&G was included in the consolidated U.S. federal, foreign and state income tax returns of GE, where allowable by law. Our prior year current and deferred taxes were determined based upon the separate return method (i.e., as if we were a taxpayer separate from GE).\nWe account for taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes actually are paid or recovered and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized.\nWe provide U.S. deferred taxes on our outside basis difference in our investment in BHGE LLC. In determining the basis difference, we exclude non-deductible goodwill and the basis difference related to certain foreign corporations owned by BHGE LLC where the undistributed earnings of the foreign corporation have been, or will be, reinvested indefinitely.\nDue to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax but may incur other taxes, such as withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management\u2019s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We operate in more than 120 countries and our tax filings are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts that we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. We recognize uncertain tax positions that are \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be sustained if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. For those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% chance of being realized in a final settlement with the relevant authority. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in the combined financial statements in the period they are recorded.\nAdditionally, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on \"base eroding\" payments from the U.S. and a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low-taxed income). In 2018, we made an accounting policy election to account for these taxes as period costs.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nWe are involved in numerous remediation actions to clean up hazardous waste as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs exclude possible insurance recoveries and, when dates and amounts of such costs are not known, are not discounted. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low end of such range. It is reasonably possible that our environmental remediation exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. The determination of the required accruals for remediation costs is subject to uncertainty, including the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the difficulty in estimating the extent and type of remediation activity that is necessary.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 61\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases, and the related amendments (ASC 842). This ASU requires lessees to recognize an operating lease asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet, with the exception of short-term leases. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach under which leases existing at, or entered into after January 1, 2019 were required to be recognized and measured. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reflected in accordance with our historical accounting. The Company has elected the practical expedients upon transition that allow entities not to reassess lease identification, classification and initial direct costs for leases that existed prior to adoption.\nThe most significant impact of the standard is the recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets and operating lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets are included in \"All other assets\" and operating lease liabilities are included in \"All other current liabilities\" and \"All other liabilities\" on our consolidated statement of financial position. Finance lease assets are included in \"Property, plant and equipment,\" and finance lease liabilities are included in \"Short-term debt,\" and \"Long-term debt\" on our consolidated statement of financial position.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the later of the lease commencement date or the effective date of adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, based on the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term. Finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental collateralized borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term leases under one year do not result in a ROU asset, but are recognized in the income statement only on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has made an election to include within our operating lease liability future payments for both lease and non-lease components. See \"Note 10. Leases\" for additional information.\nThe adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of $844 million as of January 1, 2019 on our consolidated statements of financial position with an immaterial impact on our consolidated and combined statements of equity and no related impact on our consolidated and combined statements of income (loss). Short-term leases have not been recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position. Our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. Since there was no impact from the new guidance to our consolidated and combined financial statements, no transition adjustments were recorded. ASU 2017-12 simplifies the application of hedge accounting and expands the strategies that qualify for hedge accounting. In accordance with the ASU, both the effective and ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ASU requires certain changes to the presentation of hedge accounting in the financial statements and some new or modified disclosures. See \"Note 17. Financial Instruments\" for additional information.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 62\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The ASU introduced a new accounting model, the Current Expected Credit Losses model (CECL), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses and additional disclosures related to credit risk. The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. This model replaces the multiple existing impairment models in current U.S. GAAP, which generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized. The new standard will also apply to financial assets arising from revenue transactions such as contract assets and accounts receivables and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Upon adoption, the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other -Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the requirement to calculate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment. Under the new ASU, an entity will perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. The new standard is effective for goodwill impairment tests in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and should be applied on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis.\nAll other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet effective are currently being evaluated and at this time are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nNOTE 2.

As of December 31, 2019, we expect to recognize revenue of approximately 53%, 65% and 91% of the total remaining performance obligations within 2, 5, and 15 years, respectively, and the remaining thereafter. Contract modifications could affect both the timing to complete as well as the amount to be received as we fulfill the related remaining performance obligations.\nNOTE 3. BUSINESS ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITIONS\nBUSINESS ACQUISITION\nOn July 3, 2017, we closed the Transactions to combine GE O&G and BHI. The Transactions were executed using a partnership structure, pursuant to which GE O&G and BHI each contributed their operating assets to a newly formed partnership, BHGE LLC. The fair value of the consideration exchanged was $24,798 million.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 63\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nThe tables below present the final fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the associated fair value of the noncontrolling interest related to the acquired net assets of BHI.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial data were adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that 1) are directly attributable to the Transactions, 2) factually supportable, and 3) expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of operations. The unaudited pro forma results do not include any incremental cost savings that may result from the integration.\nThe unaudited combined pro forma information is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company's results actually would have been had the acquisition been completed as of the beginning of the periods as indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma information does not purport to project the future results of the combined company.\nSignificant adjustments to the pro forma information below include amortization associated with an estimate of the acquired intangible assets and reduction of interest expense for fair value adjustments to debt.

Recip, based in Houston, Texas, was part of our TPS segment and provided high-speed reciprocating compression equipment and aftermarket parts and services for oil and gas production, gas processing, gas distribution and independent power industries. The sale resulted in a loss before income tax of $138 million reported in the \"Other non operating income (loss), net\" caption of the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss).\nIn October 2018, the Company completed the sale of its Natural Gas Solution (NGS) business for a sales price of $375 million. NGS was part of our TPS segment and provided commercial and industrial products such as gas meters, chemical injection pumps, pipeline repair products and electric actuators. The sale resulted in a gain before income tax of $171 million reported in the \"Other non operating income (loss), net\" caption of the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss).\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 65\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nNOTE 4.

The final determination of fair value of the assets and liabilities and the related goodwill associated with the acquisition of BHI was concluded in the second quarter of 2018. Of the total goodwill of $13,963 million resulting from the acquisition of BHI, $12,898 million is allocated to our Oilfield Services segment and the remainder to our other segments based on the expected benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.\nDuring the third quarter of each fiscal year, in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. Our reporting units are the same as our four reportable segments. In performing this quantitative assessment, we determine fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and market approach by assessing each of these valuation methodologies based upon availability and relevance of comparable company data and determining appropriate weighting.\nUnder the income approach, the fair value for each of our reporting units was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We used our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, including an estimate of long-term future growth rates, based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit, which includes assumptions about future commodity pricing and expected demand for our goods and services. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts.\nWe derived our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. We used discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 10.0% to 11.5% as of our testing date and these rates may change in future periods based on changes in the U.S. Treasury rate, inflation or other factors.\nValuations using the market approach were derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses was based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services.\nAfter quantifying the fair value, the carrying value of each reporting unit is then compared to its fair value and if the carrying value is more than its fair value, a step two analysis is performed. In the step two analysis, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity, and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 67\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nWe completed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of July 1, 2019 for all four of our reporting units. The step one impairment test performed included key assumptions related to macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, short and long-term forecasts, the impact, if any, of the separation from GE, among other factors, all of which require considerable judgment. In addition, we also considered the declines in our market capitalization below our book value including the magnitude and duration of those declines.\nBased on the results of our step one testing, the fair values of each of the four reporting units exceeded their carrying values; therefore, the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed for any of our reporting units and no goodwill impairment was recognized. The Turbomachinery & Process Solutions and Digital Solutions reporting units had fair values that were substantially in excess of their carrying values. The Oilfield Services (OFS) and Oilfield Equipment (OFE) reporting units had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by 8.0% and 10.0%, respectively. As part of our annual impairment test of goodwill, we performed sensitivity analyses for two key assumptions, discount rate and long-term growth rate for the OFS and OFE reporting units. We assumed a hypothetical 100-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term growth rate or a hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate. Both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for both the OFS and OFE reporting units below their carrying value.\nIn addition to our annual impairment testing, we also test goodwill for impairment between annual impairment testing dates whenever events or circumstances occur that, in our judgment, could more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more reporting units below its carrying amount. In assessing the possibility that a reporting unit\u2019s fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, we consider all available evidence, including, but not limited to, (i) the results of our most recent annual impairment testing, in particular the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed, (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts, and the magnitude thereof, if any, (iii) any negative impact as a result of any additional secondary offerings of our Class A common stock by GE (iv) declines in our market capitalization below our book value, and the magnitude and duration of those declines, if any. Between July 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, we have not identified any events or circumstances that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying amount.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the OFS and OFE reporting units remain at-risk for future goodwill impairments as it is reasonably possible that judgments and estimates of certain key assumptions could change in future periods and may result in a reduction in fair value. Any significant adverse changes in future periods to our internal forecasts or the external market conditions, if any, could reasonably be expected to negatively affect our key assumptions and may result in future goodwill impairment charges which could be material.\nOur stock price has historically experienced volatility as a result of industry-wide and macroeconomic factors, including global oil prices. In addition, more recently, we believe that our stock price has been subject to increased volatility resulting from, among other things, uncertainty around the impact of any additional secondary offerings of our Class A common stock by GE. While we believe that our stock price reflects transitory circumstances/conditions as described above, any future sustained declines in our stock price could be a triggering event which may require us to perform a quantitative test at that time.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 68\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets are comprised of the following at December 31:\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nTechnology\n$\n1,075\n$\n(626\n)\n$\n$\n1,107\n$\n(526\n)\n$\nCustomer relationships\n3,027\n(1,045\n)\n1,982\n3,085\n(944\n)\n2,141\nCapitalized software\n1,193\n(928\n)\n1,118\n(824\n)\nTrade names and trademarks\n(254\n)\n(229\n)\nOther\n(2\n)\n(2\n)\nFinite-lived intangible assets\n5,994\n(2,855\n)\n3,139\n6,022\n(2,525\n)\n3,497\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets (1)\n2,242\n-\n2,242\n2,222\n-\n2,222\nTotal intangible assets\n$\n8,236\n$\n(2,855\n)\n$\n5,381\n$\n8,244\n$\n(2,525\n)\n$\n5,719\n(1)\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are principally comprised of the Baker Hughes trade name.\nIntangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives ranging from one to 30 years.

These Senior Notes are presented net of issuance costs of $3 million in our consolidated statements of financial position. We used the proceeds from this offering to repurchase all of our outstanding 3.2% Senior Notes due August 2021. The total cash consideration paid for this repurchase excluding interest was $526 million, resulting in a loss of $7 million which was recorded in the \"Interest expense, net\" caption of the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss).\nThe estimated fair value of total borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $6,847 million and $6,629 million, respectively.

Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, BHGE LLC's obligations under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2019 Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. In connection with BHGE LLC\u2019s entry into the 2019 Credit Agreement, BHGE LLC terminated its then-existing five-year committed $3 billion revolving credit agreement dated as of July 3, 2017 (the 2017 Credit Agreement). During 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2019 or 2017 Credit Agreement.\nBHGE LLC has a commercial paper program under which it may issue from time to time up to $3 billion in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program.\nConcurrent with the Transactions associated with the acquisition of BHI on July 3, 2017, Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. became a co-obligor, jointly and severally with BHGE LLC, on our registered debt securities. This co-obligor is a 100%-owned finance subsidiary of BHGE LLC that was incorporated for the sole purpose of serving as a co-obligor of debt securities and has no assets or operations other than those related to its sole purpose. Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. is also a co-obligor of the $3,950 million senior notes issued in December 2017 by BHGE LLC in a private placement and subsequently registered in January 2018.\nCertain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict BHGE LLC's ability to take certain actions, including, but not limited to, the creation of certain liens securing debt, the entry into certain sale-leaseback transactions and engaging in certain merger, consolidation and asset sale transactions in excess of specified limits.\nSee \"Note 19.

Financial Instruments\" for additional information about borrowings and associated swaps.\nNOTE 12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nGE MULTI-EMPLOYER PLANS\nHistorically, we were allocated relevant participation costs for certain employees who participated in GE employee benefit plans as part of multi-employer plans. Certain of our U.S. employees were covered under various U.S. GE employee benefit plans, including GE's retirement plans (pension, retiree health and life insurance, and savings benefit plans). From January 1, 2019, these U.S. employees ceased to participate in the GE U.S. plans. In addition, certain United Kingdom (UK) employees participated in the GE UK Pension Plan. From May 1, 2019, these UK employees ceased to participate in the GE UK Pension Plan. Expenses associated with our participation in these plans were $3 million, $158 million and $132 million in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2019, the assets and liabilities of the GE UK Pension Plan related to the oil & gas businesses were transferred to us on a fully funded basis.\nDEFINED BENEFIT PLANS\nIn addition to these GE plans, certain of our employees are also covered by company sponsored pension plans. Our primary pension plans in 2019 included four U.S. plans and seven non-U.S. pension plans, primarily in the UK, Germany, and Canada, all with pension assets or obligations greater than $20 million. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans. These defined benefit plans generally provide benefits to employees based on formulas recognizing length of service and earnings; however, over half of these plans are either frozen or closed to new entrants. We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits (Other Postretirement Benefits), through an unfunded plan, to a closed group of U.S. employees who retire and meet certain age and service requirements.\nFunded Status\nThe funded status position represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the plan assets. The projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension benefits represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee services and compensation and includes an assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the actuarial present value of pension benefits attributed to employee\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 73\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nservice to date at present compensation levels. The ABO differs from the PBO in that the ABO does not include any assumptions about future compensation levels.

In 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved amendments to the BHIPP to close the plan to new participants and freeze accruals of future service-related benefits effective as of December 31, 2017. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded a curtailment gain of $45 million. The curtailment was recorded by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2017 and included in the \u201cOther non operating income (loss), net\u201d caption of the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss).\nThe service cost component of the net periodic cost (benefit) is included in \"operating income (loss)\" and all other components are included in \"Other non operating income, net\" caption of the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss).\nAssumptions Used in Benefit Calculations\nAccounting requirements necessitate the use of assumptions to reflect the uncertainties and the length of time over which the pension obligations will be paid. The actual amount of future benefit payments will depend upon when participants retire, the amount of their benefit at retirement and how long they live. To reflect the obligation in today\u2019s dollars, we discount the future payments using a rate that matches the time frame over which the payments will be made. We also need to assume a long-term rate of return that will be earned on investments used to fund these payments.\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for these plans are as follows for the years ended December 31:\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement\nBenefits\nDiscount rate\n2.34\n%\n3.43\n%\n2.89\n%\n3.92\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.11\n%\n3.78\n%\nn/a\nn/a\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 75\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost for these plans are as follows for the years ended December 31:\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement\nBenefits\nDiscount rate\n3.43\n%\n2.99\n%\n3.24\n%\n3.92\n%\n3.32\n%\n3.72\n%\nExpected long-term return on plan assets\n5.48\n%\n5.94\n%\n6.26\n%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nWe determine the discount rate using a bond matching model, whereby the weighted average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities have maturities consistent with the timing of benefit payments. Lower discount rates increase the size of the benefit obligations and pension expense in the following year; higher discount rates reduce the size of the benefit obligation and subsequent-year pension expense. The compensation assumption is used in our active plans to estimate the annual rate at which the pay for plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase.\nThe expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the pension obligations. To determine this rate, we consider the current and target composition of plan investments, our historical returns earned, and our expectations about the future.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for Other Postretirement Benefits. As of December 31, 2019, the health care cost trend rate was 6.50%, declining gradually each successive year until it reaches 4.50%. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have been immaterial in 2019.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe amount recorded before-tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to employee benefit plans consists of the following at December 31:\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement\nBenefits\nNet actuarial loss (gain)\n$\n$\n$\n(38\n)\n$\n(29\n)\nNet prior service cost (credit)\n(15\n)\n(18\n)\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n(53\n)\n$\n(47\n)\nThe estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in net periodic benefit cost in 2020 is $32 million and $1 million, respectively. The estimated net actuarial gain and prior service credit for the other postretirement benefits that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in net periodic benefit cost in 2020 is $3 million and $3 million, respectively.\nPlan Assets\nWe have investment committees that meet regularly to review the portfolio returns and to determine asset-mix targets based on asset/liability studies. Third-party investment consultants assist such committees in developing asset allocation strategies to determine our expected rates of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. The investment committees considered these strategies in the formal establishment of the current asset-mix targets based on the projected risk and return levels for all major asset classes.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 76\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nThe table below presents the fair value of the pension assets at December 31:\nEquity securities\nU.S. equity securities (1)\n$\n$\nGlobal equity securities (1)\nDebt securities\nFixed income and cash investment funds\n1,858\nOther debt securities\nPrivate equities\nReal estate\nOther investments (2)\nTotal plan assets\n$\n3,004\n$\n1,866\n(1)\nInclude direct investments and investment funds.\n(2)\nConsists primarily of asset allocation fund investments.\nPlan assets valued using Net Asset Value (NAV) as a practical expedient amounted to $2,988 million and $1,802 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The percentages of plan assets valued using NAV by investment fund type for equity securities, fixed income and cash, and alternative investments were 20%, 62%, and 18% as of December 31, 2019, respectively, and 30%, 48%, and 19% as of December 31, 2018, respectively. Those investments that were measured at fair value using NAV as practical expedient were excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The practical expedient was not applied for investments with a fair value of $14 million and $64 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no investments classified within Level 3 in 2019 and 2018. The remaining investments were considered Level 1 and 2.\nFunding Policy\nThe funding policy for our Pension Benefits is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus such additional amounts as we may determine to be appropriate. In 2019, we contributed approximately $23 million. We expect to contribute approximately $21 million to our pension plans in 2020.\nWe fund our Other Postretirement Benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. In 2019, we funded $16 million and in 2020, we expect to fund approximately $11 million to such benefits.\nThe following table presents the expected benefit payments over the next 10 years.

The 401(k) Plan allows eligible employees to elect to contribute portions of their eligible compensation to an investment trust. Employee contributions are matched by the Company in cash at the rate of $1.00 per $1.00 employee contribution for the first 5% of the employee's eligible compensation, and such contributions vest immediately. In addition, we make cash contributions for all eligible employees of 4% of their eligible compensation and such contributions are fully vested to the employee after three years of employment. During 2018, the legacy BHI employees participated in the 401(k) Plan whereas the legacy GE O&G employees continued to participate in the GE sponsored plan. Beginning in 2019, certain legacy GE O&G employees were eligible to participate in our defined contribution plans, including our 401(k) Plan. Legacy BHI employees continued to participate in the 401(k) Plan during 2019. The 401(k) Plan provides several investment options, for which the employee has sole investment discretion, however, the 401(k) Plan does not offer the Company's common stock as an investment option. Our costs for the 401(k) Plan and several other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans amounted to $235 million and $137 million, in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOther\nWe have two non-qualified defined contribution plans that are invested through trusts. The assets and corresponding liabilities were $276 million and $233 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in \"All other assets\" and \"Liabilities for pensions and other employee benefits\" captions in our consolidated and combined statements of financial position.\nNOTE 13. INCOME TAXES\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform) that lowers the statutory tax rate on U.S. earnings, taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from U.S. taxation at a reduced rate of tax (transition tax), establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations.\nThe impact of U.S. tax reform was initially recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provided for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax. Based on guidance received to date, finalization of purchase accounting for the BHI acquisition, and finalization of our 2017 U.S. income tax returns, we have recorded a $107 million tax benefit in 2018 for the impact of tax reform primarily related to the revaluation of deferred taxes.\nAdditionally, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on \"base eroding\" payments from the U.S. and a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low-taxed income). We have made an accounting policy election to account for these taxes as period costs.\nThe provision or benefit for income taxes is comprised of the following for the years ended December 31:\nCurrent:\nU.S.\n$\n(12\n)\n$\n$\n(75\n)\nForeign\nTotal current\nDeferred:\nU.S.\n(12\n)\n(211\n)\n(150\n)\nForeign\n(38\n)\n(183\n)\nTotal deferred\n(249\n)\n(333\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n$\n$\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 78\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nThe geographic sources of income (loss) before income taxes, inclusive of equity in loss of affiliate, are as follows for the years ended December 31:\nU.S.\n$\n(693\n)\n$\n(672\n)\n$\n(1,189\n)\nForeign\n1,446\n1,213\nIncome (loss) before income taxes, inclusive of equity in loss of affiliate\n$\n$\n$\n(346\n)\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the loss or income before income taxes for the reasons set forth below for the years ended December 31:\nIncome (loss) before income taxes, inclusive of equity in loss of affiliate\n$\n$\n$\n(346\n)\nTaxes at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate\n(121\n)\nEffect of foreign operations\n(19\n)\nTax impact of partnership structure\nChange in valuation allowances\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act enactment\n-\n(107\n)\n(132\n)\nOther - net\n(19\n)\n(19\n)\n(23\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n$\n$\nActual income tax rate\n64.0\n%\n47.7\n%\n(13.0\n)%\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nThe tax effects of our temporary differences and carryforwards are as follows at December 31:\nDeferred tax assets:\nReceivables\n$\n$\nInventory\nProperty\nGoodwill and other intangibles\nEmployee benefits\nInvestment in partnership\nOther accrued expenses\nOperating loss carryforwards\n1,654\n1,525\nTax credit carryforwards\nOther\nTotal deferred income tax asset\n3,815\n3,328\nValuation allowances\n(2,883\n)\n(2,372\n)\nTotal deferred income tax asset after valuation allowance\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nUndistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries\n-\n(9\n)\nOther\n(29\n)\n(18\n)\nTotal deferred income tax liability\n(29\n)\n(27\n)\nNet deferred tax asset\n$\n$\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 79\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $366 million of non-U.S. tax credits which may be carried forward indefinitely under applicable foreign law, $543 million of foreign tax credits and $32 million of other credits, the majority of which will expire after tax year 2027 under U.S. tax law. Additionally, we had $1,654 million of net operating loss carryforwards, of which approximately $331 million will expire within five years, $326 million will expire between 6 years and 20 years, and the remainder can be carried forward indefinitely.\nWe record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. At December 31, 2019, $2,883 million of valuation allowances are recorded against various deferred tax assets, including foreign net operating losses (NOL) of $1,257 million, U.S. federal and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $909 million, other U.S. NOL's and tax credit carryforwards of $109 million, and certain other U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets of $608 million. There are $290 million of deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards without a valuation allowance as we expect that the deferred tax assets will be realized within the carryforward period.\nSubstantially all of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management\u2019s intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. Substantially all of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. As of December 31, 2019, the cumulative amount of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings is approximately $6.7 billion. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $451 million of tax liabilities for total gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. In addition to these uncertain tax positions, we had $93 million and $29 million related to interest and penalties, respectively, for total liabilities of $573 million for uncertain positions. If we were to prevail on all uncertain positions, the net effect would result in an income tax benefit of approximately $515 million. The remaining $58 million comprised of $21 million for deferred tax assets that represent tax benefits that would be received in different taxing jurisdictions in the event that we did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions and increased valuation allowances of $37 million.\nThe following table presents the changes in our gross unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated and combined statements of financial position.\nAsset / (Liability)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n(472\n)\n$\n(395\n)\nBalance acquired from BHI\n-\n(142\n)\nAdditions for tax positions of the current year\n(25\n)\n(21\n)\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n(27\n)\n(95\n)\nReductions for tax positions of prior years\nSettlements with tax authorities\nLapse of statute of limitations\nBalance at end of year\n$\n(451\n)\n$\n(472\n)\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, and competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of litigation in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $67 million of tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, each of which are individually insignificant, and each of which are reasonably possible of being settled within the next twelve months.\nWe conduct business in more than 120 countries and are subject to income taxes in most taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. All Internal Revenue Service examinations have been completed and closed through year end 2016 for the most significant U.S. returns. We believe there are no other jurisdictions in which the outcome of\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 80\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nunresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.\nNOTE 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn July 2017, we adopted the Baker Hughes 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan) under which we may grant stock options and other equity-based awards to employees and non-employee directors providing services to the Company and our subsidiaries. A total of up to 57.4 million shares of Class A common stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the LTI Plan over its term which expires on the date of the annual meeting of the Company in 2027. A total of 35.5 million shares of Class A common stock are available for issuance as of December 31, 2019.\nStock-based compensation cost was $187 million, $121 million and $37 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant based on the calculated fair value of the award and is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the equity grant. The compensation cost is determined based on awards ultimately expected to vest; therefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures. There were no stock-based compensation costs capitalized as the amounts were not material.\nStock Options\nWe may grant stock options to our officers, directors and key employees. Stock options generally vest in equal amounts over a vesting period of 3 years provided that the employee has remained continuously employed by the Company through such vesting date. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used in the option pricing model for options granted under the LTI Plan. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding. The expected life is based on a simple average of the vesting term and original contractual term of the awards. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our five main competitors over a six year period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the observed U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time the options were granted. In 2019, the dividend yield is based on Baker Hughes' current annual cash dividend divided by the valuation date stock price. Prior to 2019, the dividend yield was based on a five year history of dividend payouts by BHI.\nExpected life (years)\nRisk-free interest rate\n2.6\n%\n2.5\n%\n2.1\n%\nVolatility\n36.5\n%\n33.7\n%\n36.4\n%\nDividend yield\n3.1\n%\n2.0\n%\n1.2\n%\nWeighted average fair value per share at grant date\n$\n6.37\n$\n10.34\n$\n12.32\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 81\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nThe following table presents the changes in stock options outstanding and related information (in thousands, except per option prices):\nNumber of\nOptions\nWeighted Average\nExercise Price\nPer Option\nOutstanding at December 31, 2018\n7,538\n$\n34.76\nGranted\n2,301\n22.98\nExercised\n(491\n)\n18.96\nForfeited\n(305\n)\n29.42\nExpired\n(633\n)\n36.85\nOutstanding at December 31, 2019\n8,410\n$\n32.50\nExercisable at December 31, 2019\n5,155\n$\n35.68\nThe weighted average remaining contractual term for options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2019 were 5.4 years and 3.4 years, respectively. The maximum contractual term of options outstanding is 9.1 years.\nThere were 867 thousand and 505 thousand options that vested in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total fair value of options vested in 2019 and 2018 was $10 million and $6 million, respectively. There were no options vested during 2017. As of December 31, 2019, there was $16 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years.\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised (defined as the amount by which the market price of our common stock on the date of exercise exceeds the exercise price of the option) in 2019 was $2 million. There is no income tax benefit realized from stock options exercised in 2019.\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2019 was $7 million, of which $2 million are exercisable. The intrinsic value of stock options outstanding is calculated as the amount by which the quoted price of $25.63 of our common stock as of the end of 2019 exceeds the exercise price of the options.\nRestricted Stock\nIn addition to stock options, our officers, directors and key employees may be granted restricted stock awards (RSA), which is an award of common stock with no exercise price, or restricted stock units (RSU), where each unit represents the right to receive, at the end of a stipulated period, one unrestricted share of stock with no exercise price. Certain RSAs and RSUs are subject to cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging over a period of 3 years, or over a one year period for non-employee directors. Cash dividend equivalents are accrued on RSUs and are payable upon vesting of the awards. We determine the fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, discounted by the present value of future dividends.\nThe following table presents the changes in RSUs outstanding and related information (in thousands, except per unit prices):\nNumber of\nUnits\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue Per Unit\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2018\n6,882\n$\n36.18\nGranted\n8,267\n23.10\nVested\n(2,813\n)\n35.98\nForfeited\n(1,051\n)\n29.54\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2019\n11,285\n$\n27.26\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 82\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nIn 2019, the total intrinsic value of RSUs vested (defined as the value of shares awarded based on the price of our common stock at vesting date) was $68 million and unvested RSUs was $289 million. The total fair value of RSUs vested in 2019 was $101 million. As of December 31, 2019, there was $180 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.\nPerformance Share Units\nDuring 2018, we initiated a new plan where we grant performance share units (PSUs) to certain officers and key employees. The PSUs are stock-based awards tied to predefined company metrics and total shareholder return (TSR), which determine the number of units to be received. PSUs generally cliff vest after a service period of 3 years. Cash dividend equivalents are accrued only on PSUs tied to predefined company metrics and are payable upon vesting of the awards. The fair value of the awards determined for the predefined company metrics are based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, discounted by the present value of future dividends. The fair value of the TSR awards are determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation method.\nThe following table presents the changes in PSUs outstanding and related information (in thousands, except per unit prices):\nNumber of\nUnits\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue Per Unit\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2018\n$\n35.13\nGranted\n1,275\n22.72\nVested\n-\n-\nForfeited\n(158\n)\n28.34\nUnvested balance at December 31, 2019\n2,044\n$\n27.91\nThe total intrinsic value of PSUs (defined as the value of the shares awarded at the year end market price) outstanding was $52 million as of December 31, 2019. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested PSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years, was $31 million as of December 31, 2019.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) provides for eligible employees to purchase shares of Class A common stock quarterly on an after-tax basis in an amount between 1% and 20% of their annual pay on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year at a 15% discount of the fair market value of our Class A common stock on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. An employee may not purchase more than $3,000 in any of the three-month measurement periods described above or $12,000 annually.\nA total of 15 million shares of Class A common stock are authorized for issuance, and at December 31, 2019, there were 12.9 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 83\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nNOTE 15. EQUITY\nCOMMON STOCK\nWe are authorized to issue 2 billion shares of Class A common stock, 1.25 billion shares of Class B common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock each of which have a par value of $0.0001 per share. The number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding at December 31, 2019 is 650 million and 377 million, respectively. We have not issued any preferred stock. GE owns all the issued and outstanding Class B common stock. Each share of Class A and Class B common stock and the associated membership interest in BHGE LLC form a paired interest. While each share of Class B common stock has equal voting rights to a share of Class A common stock, it has no economic rights, meaning holders of Class B common stock have no right to dividends and any assets in the event of liquidation of the Company. GE is entitled through BHGE LLC Units (LLC Units) to receive distributions on an equal per share amount of any dividend paid by the Company.\nDuring 2019 and 2018, the Company declared and paid aggregate regular dividends of $0.72 per share to holders of record of the Company's Class A common stock.\nThe following table presents the changes in the number of shares outstanding (in thousands):\nClass A Common Stock\nClass B Common Stock\nClass A Common Stock\nClass B Common Stock\nBalance at beginning of year\n513,399\n521,543\n422,208\n706,985\nIssue of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units (1)\n1,973\n-\n-\nIssue of shares on exercises of stock options (1)\n-\n-\nIssue of shares for employee stock purchase plan\n2,081\n-\n-\n-\nExchange of Class B common stock for Class A common stock (2)\n132,250\n(132,250\n)\n101,200\n(101,200\n)\nRepurchase and cancellation of Class A and B common stock (3)\n-\n(11,865\n)\n(11,501\n)\n(84,241\n)\nBalance at end of year\n650,065\n377,428\n513,399\n521,543\n(1)\nShare amounts reflected above are net of shares withheld to satisfy the employee's tax withholding obligation.\n(2)\nIn September 2019 and November 2018, we completed underwritten secondary public offerings in which GE and its affiliates sold 132.3 million and 101.2 million shares of our Class A common stock, respectively. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by GE and its affiliates in these offerings. The offerings included the exchange by GE and its affiliates of LLC Units, together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock, for Class A common stock. When shares of Class B common stock, together with associated LLC Units, are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, such shares of Class B common stock are canceled.\n(3)\nIn September 2019, we also repurchased and canceled 11,865,211 shares of Class B common stock, together with an equal number of associated LLC Units, from GE and its affiliates for an aggregate of $250 million, or $21.07 per share, which is the same per share price paid by the underwriters to GE and its affiliates in the concurrent underwritten public offering. During 2018, we repurchased and canceled 11,500,992 shares of Class A common stock for a total of $374 million and 19,241,160 shares of Class B common stock from GE together with the paired common units of BHGE LLC for $626 million. Additionally, in November 2018, we also repurchased 65 million of LLC Units from GE and its affiliates for an aggregate of $1,461 million, or $22.48 per share, which is the same per share price paid by the underwriters to GE and its affiliates in the concurrent underwritten public offering. In connection with these repurchases, the corresponding shares of Class B common stock held by GE and its affiliates were canceled.\nAs a result of the exchange of shares in the secondary offering and the Class B common stock, together with the associated LLC Units repurchased in September 2019, GE's interest in Baker Hughes reduced during the third quarter of 2019 from approximately 50.3% to approximately 36.8%. The effect of this change in ownership resulted in a decrease in noncontrolling interests of $4,497 million and accumulated other comprehensive income of $350 million with a corresponding increase in capital in excess of par value totaling $4,847 million.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 84\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nAs a result of the exchange of shares in the secondary offering and the Class B common stock, together with the associated LLC Units repurchased in November 2018, GE's interest in Baker Hughes reduced during the fourth quarter of 2018 from approximately 62.5% to approximately 50.4%.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, GE owned approximately 36.7% and 50.4%, respectively, of BHGE LLC and this represents the majority of the noncontrolling interest balance reported within equity.\nGE's interest in BHGE LLC\n$\n12,454\n$\n17,438\nOther noncontrolling interests\nTotal noncontrolling interests\n$\n12,570\n$\n17,548\nNOTE 16.

In computing the dilutive effect, if any, that the aforementioned exchange would have on net income (loss) per share, net income (loss) attributable to holders of Class A common stock would be adjusted due to the elimination of the noncontrolling interests associated with the Class B common stock (including any tax impact). For the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, such exchange is not reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share as the assumed exchange is not dilutive.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Class A diluted shares include the dilutive impact of equity awards. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we excluded outstanding stock options and RSUs from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share because their effect is antidilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were approximately six million and four million options, respectively, that were excluded from our diluted EPS calculation because their effect is antidilutive. These options were outstanding but excluded from the calculation because the exercise price exceeded the average market price of the Class A common stock.\nShares of our Class B common stock do not share in earnings or losses of the Company and are not considered in the calculation of basic or diluted earnings per share (EPS). As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted EPS of Class B under the two class method has not been presented.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 86\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nNOTE 17.

Discount rates are determined based on inputs that market participants would use when pricing investments, including credit and liquidity risk. An increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investment securities. There are no unrealized gains or losses recognized in the consolidated and combined statement of income (loss) on account of any Level 3 instrument still held at the reporting date.

Except for long-term debt, the estimated fair value of these financial instruments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 approximates their carrying value as reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements. For further information on the fair value of our debt, see \"Note 11. Borrowings.\"\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING\nWe use derivatives to manage our risks and do not use derivatives for speculation.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $24 million and $79 million of derivative liabilities are recorded in \"All other current liabilities\" and $3 million and $3 million are recorded in \"All other liabilities\" of the consolidated statements of financial position, respectively.\nRISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\nWe buy, manufacture and sell components and products as well as provide services across global markets. These activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which can adversely affect revenues earned and costs of operating our business. When the currency in which we sell equipment differs from the primary currency (known as its functional currency) and the exchange rate fluctuates, it will affect the revenue we earn on the sale. These sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, along with other monetary assets and liabilities, which expose us to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates. Changes in the price of a raw material that we use in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing. We use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 88\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nFORMS OF HEDGING\nCash flow hedges\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, the vast majority of our derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts. We also use commodity derivatives to reduce or eliminate price risk on raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing.\nChanges in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in a separate component of equity (referred to below as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, or AOCI) and are recorded in earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction occurs. The table below summarizes this activity by hedging instrument.\nGain (Loss) Recognized in AOCI\nGain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI to Earnings\nCurrency exchange contracts\n$\n$\n(6\n)\n$\n$\n(1\n)\n$\n(1\n)\n$\n(7\n)\nWe expect to transfer $10 million to earnings as a gain in the next 12 months contemporaneously with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the maximum term of derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was one year and two years, respectively.\nEconomic Hedges\nThese derivatives are not designated as hedges from an accounting standpoint (and therefore we do not apply hedge accounting to the relationship) but otherwise serve the same economic purpose as other hedging arrangements. Some economic hedges are used when changes in the carrying amount of the hedged item are already recorded in earnings in the same period as the derivative, making hedge accounting unnecessary. For some other types of economic hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings currently but changes in the value of the forecasted foreign currency cash flows are only recognized in earnings when they occur. As a result, even though the derivative is an effective economic hedge, there is a net effect on earnings in each period due to differences in the timing of earnings recognition between the derivative and the hedged item.\nThese derivatives are marked to fair value through earnings each period. The effects are reported in \"Selling, general and administrative\" in the consolidated and combined statement of income (loss). In general, the income (loss) effects of the hedged item are recorded in the same consolidated and combined financial statement line as the derivative. The income (loss) effect of economic hedges, after considering offsets related to income (loss) effects of hedged assets and liabilities, is substantially offset by changes in the fair value of forecasted transactions that have not yet affected income (loss).\nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) from derivatives not designated as hedges on the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss):\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nConsolidated and combined statement of income caption\nCurrency exchange contracts (1)\nCost of goods sold\n$\n(6\n)\n$\n(12\n)\n$\nCurrency exchange contracts\nSelling, general and administrative\n(22\n)\nCommodity derivatives\nCost of goods sold\n(1\n)\nOther derivatives\nOther non operating income (loss), net\n-\n-\nTotal (2)\n$\n(24\n)\n$\n(4\n)\n$\n(1)\nExcludes losses on embedded derivatives of $7 million, $3 million and $76 million at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as embedded derivatives are not considered to be hedging instruments in our economic hedges.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 89\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\n(2)\nThe effect on earnings of derivatives not designated as hedges is substantially offset by change in fair value of the economically hedged items in the current and future periods.\nNOTIONAL AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVES\nThe notional amount of a derivative is the number of units of the underlying (for example, the notional principal amount of the debt in an interest rate swap). A substantial majority of the outstanding notional amount of $5.7 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, is related to hedges of anticipated sales and purchases in foreign currency, commodity purchases, and contractual terms in contracts that are considered embedded derivatives and for intercompany borrowings in foreign currencies. We generally disclose derivative notional amounts on a gross basis to indicate the total counterparty risk. Where we have gross purchase and sale derivative contracts for a particular currency, we look to execute these contracts with the same counterparty to reduce our exposure. The corresponding net notional amounts were $1.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2018.\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK\nFair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market movements and changes in our positions. We manage counterparty credit risk (the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our agreements) on an individual counterparty basis.\nOTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amount of equity securities without readily determinable fair values was $637 million and $542 million, respectively. In 2019, certain of these equity instruments were remeasured to fair value as of the date that an observable transaction occurred, which resulted in the Company recording an unrealized gain of $19 million.\nNOTE 18.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nGE is our largest shareholder, and we enter into various related party transactions with it. On September 16, 2019 (the Trigger Date), as a result of the secondary offering and the repurchase of Class B common stock and associated LLC Units, GE's ownership in us was reduced from approximately 50.3% to approximately 36.8%, and GE ceased to be our controlling shareholder. At December 31, 2019, GE's interest in us was 36.7%.\nFollowing the Transactions, we have entered into various agreements with GE and its affiliates that govern our relationship with GE including an Intercompany Services Agreement pursuant to which GE and its affiliates and the Company provide certain services to each other. GE provided certain administrative services, GE proprietary technology and use of certain GE trademarks for an annual intercompany services fee of $55 million. Under the terms of the Master Agreement Framework, entered into on November 13, 2018, the annual intercompany services fee of $55 million was reduced by 50% to $27.5 million per year beginning on January 1, 2019. The Intercompany Services Agreement terminated on December 15, 2019 except with respect to certain provisions, including relating to certain tools access.\nWe sold products and services to GE and its affiliates for $337 million, $363 million and $639 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Purchases from GE and its affiliates were $1,498 million, $1,791 million and $1,512 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nMASTER AGREEMENT FRAMEWORK\nIn June 2018, GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from us over time. On November 13, 2018, we entered into a Master Agreement and a series of related ancillary agreements and binding term sheets (which were later negotiated into definitive agreements) with GE and BHGE LLC (collectively, the Master Agreement Framework) designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaborations between us and GE and to facilitate our ability to transition from operating as a controlled company. In particular, the Master Agreement Framework contemplated long-term agreements between us, BHGE LLC and GE on technology, fulfillment and other key areas to provide greater clarity to customers, employees and shareholders.\nKey elements of the Master Agreement Framework include:\nSecured long-term collaboration on critical rotating equipment\nUnder the terms of the Master Agreement Framework, we have defined the parameters for a long-term collaboration and strategic relationship with GE on certain critical rotating equipment products.\nOn February 28, 2019, we entered into an aero-derivative joint venture (JV) agreement with GE to form a JV relating to the parties\u2019 respective aero-derivative gas turbine products and services. These jet engine aero-derivative products are mainly used in our Turbomachinery & Process Solutions segment. Consequently, on November 1, 2019, BHGE LLC contributed $289 million in certain assets, inventory, cash and service facilities into Aero Products and Services JV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and both GE and BHGE LLC jointly control its operations. In addition to the contributions to the JV, we paid $60 million to GE in order to equalize each party's interests in the JV at 50%. The JV has a supply and technology development agreement with GE\u2019s aviation business, which, among other things, revised and extended certain pricing arrangements for applicable aero-derivative products. The Company's interest in the JV is accounted for as an equity method investment.\nAdditionally, effective May 1, 2019, we closed on the previously announced transfer of our assets, liabilities and employees related to our prior business of developing, designing, engineering, marketing, supplying, installing and servicing certain industrial steam turbine product lines (IST) to GE pursuant to a stock and asset purchase agreement. In addition and in connection with the transfer of the IST business, we made a cash payment of $13 million, in addition to working capital adjustments, to GE at the closing of the transaction.\nIn parallel, we have also entered into an agreement for the long-term supply and related distribution arrangement with GE for heavy-duty gas turbine technology at the current pricing levels, which became effective at the Trigger Date. Under this agreement, BHGE LLC is appointed as GE's exclusive distributor (with limited\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 93\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nexceptions) within the oil and gas industry with respect to the heavy-duty gas turbine units for an initial term of 5 years and associated services (including parts and components) for an initial term of 20 years or the operating service life of the relevant gas turbine, whichever is more. The heavy-duty gas turbine technologies are important components of TPS\u2019 offerings and the long-term agreements provide greater clarity on the commercial approach and customer fulfillment, and will enable Baker Hughes and GE to jointly innovate on leading technology.\nAccess to GE Digital software & technology\nAs part of the Master Agreement Framework, BHGE LLC agreed with GE Digital to maintain, subject to certain conditions, BHGE LLC's status as the exclusive reseller of GE Digital offerings in the oil & gas space. As part of such agreement, BHGE LLC and GE Digital also revised and extended certain pricing arrangements and established service level obligations. However, these commercial arrangements were further modified pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, described below, including by modifying the relationship between BHGE LLC and GE Digital to be nonexclusive with respect to digital offerings in the oil and gas space.\nOther key agreements\n\u2022 We agreed with GE to maintain current operations and pricing levels with regards to Control upgrade services we offer through our Digital Solutions segment division for the 4 years commencing on the Trigger Date.\n\u2022 In 2019, GE transferred to us certain UK pension liabilities related to our oil and gas businesses and certain specified former oil and gas businesses of GE. The assets associated with these liabilities were also transferred on a fully funded basis. No liabilities associated with GE\u2019s broad-based U.S. defined benefit pension plan were transferred to us.\n\u2022 The Tax Matters Agreement with GE that was negotiated at the time of the Transactions will remain substantially in place and both companies retain the ability to monetize certain tax benefits.\n\u2022 Under the terms of the Master Agreement Framework, the annual intercompany services fee of $55 million that we agreed to pay GE as part of the Transactions was reduced by 50% to $27.5 million per year beginning on January 1, 2019. The Intercompany Services Agreement terminated on December 15, 2019 except with respect to certain tools access.\nIn addition, the Stockholders Agreement was amended and restated to provide that, following the Trigger Date and until GE and its affiliates own less than 20% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, GE shall be entitled to designate one person for nomination to our board of directors.\nOMNIBUS AGREEMENT\nOn July 31, 2019, we entered into an Omnibus Agreement, a general framework agreement that addresses certain outstanding matters under existing long-term commercial agreements between us and GE. The Omnibus Agreement contains provisions regarding, among other things, (i) the repayment of certain outstanding amounts mutually owed by the parties, (ii) certain employee and assets transfers (including the allocation of costs and expenses associated therewith), and (iii) certain matters related to three international joint ventures.\nMaterial terms agreed to between the parties include:\ni.\nProvision of certain transition services by each of BHGE LLC and GE, including providing for the development and use of certain service related intellectual property at the end of the transition period and the management of certain data and information for future business needs;\nii.\nSale of certain digital business assets of Baker Hughes to GE for consideration of $50 million, which closed on September 3, 2019;\niii.\nModification of certain sales arrangements between the parties and the ability of each party to directly market offerings of its digital business to customers in the oil and gas industry;\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 94\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\niv.\nResearch and development efforts and the purchase of products and services related to aero-derivative turbines;\nv.\nSupply and distribution terms for certain trailer-mounted gas turbine generator-based engine units and related parts and services; and\nvi.\nRepayment by Baker Hughes to GE of amounts due under the promissory note (see Other Related Party discussion below), net of certain costs and tax adjustments;\nOTHER RELATED PARTY\nIn connection with the Transactions, on July 3, 2017, we executed a promissory note with GE (which was amended and restated on July 31, 2019 in connection with the entry into the Omnibus Agreement referenced above) that represents certain cash that we are holding on GE's behalf due to the restricted nature of the cash. The restriction arises as the majority of the cash cannot be released, transferred or otherwise converted into a non-restricted market currency due to the lack of market liquidity, capital controls or similar monetary or exchange limitations by a Government entity of the jurisdiction in which such cash is situated. There is no maturity date on the promissory note, but we remain obligated to repay GE, therefore, this obligation is reflected as short-term borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, of the $273 million due to GE, $162 million was held in the form of cash and $111 million was held in the form of investment securities. As of December 31, 2018, of the $896 million due to GE, $747 million was held in the form of cash and $149 million was held in the form of investment securities. A corresponding liability is reported in short-term borrowings in the consolidated and combined statements of financial position.\nThe Company has $536 million and $538 million of accounts payable at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for goods and services provided by GE in the ordinary course of business; this excludes any liability associated with our participation in the trade payables accelerated payment program (see below). The Company has $495 million and $653 million of current receivables at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for goods and services provided to GE in the ordinary course of business.\nWe also provide guarantees to GE Capital on behalf of some customers who have entered into financing arrangements with GE Capital.\nTRADE PAYABLES ACCELERATED PAYMENT PROGRAM\nPrior to our separation from GE, our North American operations participated in supply chain finance programs funded through GE Capital. Invoices were settled with suppliers per our payment terms to obtain cash discounts. GE Capital provided funding for invoices eligible for a cash discount. Our liability associated with the GE Capital funded participation in the accounts payable programs was $38 million and $471 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs a result of separation, our participation in this program ended, and we have begun transitioning to a program administered by a third party. Under these supply chain finance programs, our suppliers are given the opportunity to sell receivables from us to participating financial institutions at their sole discretion. A third party administers the program. Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. These liabilities continue to be presented as accounts payable in our consolidated statements of financial position and reflected as cash flow from operating activities when settled.\nNOTE 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLITIGATION\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the conduct of our business. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. We record\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 95\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\na liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, including accruals for self-insured losses which are calculated based on historical claim data, specific loss development factors and other information.\nA range of total possible losses for all litigation matters cannot be reasonably estimated. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, we do not expect the ultimate outcome of currently pending lawsuits or claims against us, other than those discussed below, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters.\nWith respect to the litigation matters below, if there was an adverse outcome individually or collectively, there could be a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations expected for the year. These litigation matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. Therefore, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters.\nDuring 2014, we received notification from a customer related to a possible equipment failure in a natural gas storage system in Northern Germany, which includes certain of our products. The customer initiated arbitration proceedings against us on June 19, 2015, under the rules of the German Institute of Arbitration e.V. (DIS). On August 3, 2016, the customer amended its claims and alleged damages of \u20ac202 million plus interest at an annual rate of prime + 5%. Hearings before the arbitration panel were held January 16, 2017 through January 23, 2017, and March 20, 2017 through March 21, 2017. In addition, on September 21, 2015, TRIUVA Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division against the Company and Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc. alleging that the plaintiff is the owner of gas storage caverns in Etzel, Germany in which the Company provided certain equipment in connection with the development of the gas storage caverns. The plaintiff further alleges that the Company supplied equipment that was either defectively designed or failed to warn of risks that the equipment posed, and that these alleged defects caused damage to the plaintiff's property. The plaintiff seeks recovery of alleged compensatory and punitive damages of an unspecified amount, in addition to reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. The allegations in this lawsuit are related to the claims made in the June 19, 2015 German arbitration referenced above. On June 7, 2018, the DIS arbitration panel issued a confidential Arbitration Ruling which addressed all claims asserted by the customer. The estimated financial impact of the Arbitration Ruling has been reflected in the Company's financial statements and did not have a material impact. Further, on March 11, 2019, the customer initiated a second arbitral proceeding against us, under the rules of the German Institute of Arbitration e.V. (DIS). The customer alleged damages of \u20ac142 million plus interest at an annual rate of prime + 5% since June 20, 2015. The allegations in this second arbitration proceeding are related to the claims made in the June 19, 2015 German arbitration and Houston Federal Court proceedings referenced above. The Company is contesting the claims made by TRIUVA in the Houston Federal Court and the claims made by the customer in the second arbitration proceeding. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the claims asserted in the Houston Federal Court or the second arbitration proceeding.\nOn July 31, 2015, Rapid Completions LLC filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas against Baker Hughes Incorporated, Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc., and others claiming infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,907,936; 7,134,505; 7,543,634; 7,861,774; and 8,657,009. On August 6, 2015, Rapid Completions amended its complaint to allege infringement of U.S. Patent No. 9,074,451. On April 1, 2016, Rapid Completions removed U.S. Patent No. 6,907,936 from its claims in the lawsuit. On April 5, 2016, Rapid Completions filed a second lawsuit in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas against Baker Hughes Incorporated, Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc. and others claiming infringement of U.S. Patent No. 9,303,501. These patents relate primarily to certain specific downhole completions equipment. The plaintiff has requested a permanent injunction against further alleged infringement, damages in an unspecified amount, supplemental and enhanced damages, and additional relief such as attorney's fees and costs. During August and September 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) agreed to institute an inter-partes review of U.S. Patent Nos 7,861,774; 7,134,505; 7,543,634; 6,907,936; 8,657,009; and 9,074,451. On August 29, 2017, the USPTO issued its final written decisions in the inter-partes reviews of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,657,009 and 9,074,451 finding that all claims of those patents were unpatentable. On August 31, 2017, the USPTO issued its final written decision in the inter-partes review of U.S. Patent 6,907,936 - the patent dropped from the lawsuit by the plaintiffs - finding that all claims of this patent were patentable. On October 27, 2017, Rapid Completions filed its notices of appeal of the USPTO\u2019s\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 96\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nfinal written decision in the inter-partes review of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,657,009 and 9,074,451. On September 26, 2018, the USPTO issued its final written decision in the inter-partes review of U.S. Patent No. 7,134,505 finding all of the challenged claims unpatentable. On September 27, 2018, the USPTO issued its final written decision in the inter-partes review of U.S. Patent No. 7,543,634 finding all of the challenged claims unpatentable. On November 19, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the USPTO\u2019s unpatentability findings with respect to U.S. Patent Nos. 8,657,009 and 9,074,451. On November 26, 2018, Rapid Completions filed notices of appeal of the USPTO\u2019s final written decisions in the inter partes reviews of U.S. Patent No. 7,134,505, and 7,543,634. On May 2, 2019, the USPTO issued a final written decision in an IPR on U.S. Patent Number 9,303,501 finding all of its claims unpatentable, and Rapid Completions appealed that decision to the Federal Circuit on July 5, 2019. On November 13, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the USPTO\u2019s unpatentability findings with respect to U.S. Patent No. 7,134,505, and 7,543,634. On November 26, 2019, the USPTO issued a final written decision in the inter-partes review of U.S. Patent No. 7,861,774 finding all challenged claims unpatentable, and Rapid Completions did not timely appeal that decision. On January 21, 2020, the Federal Circuit affirmed the USPTO\u2019s unpatentability finding as to all asserted claims of the U.S. Patent No. 9,303,501.\nOn September 17, 2015, Rapid Completions and Packers Plus Energy Services Inc. sued Baker Hughes Canada Company in the Canada Federal Court on the related Canadian patent 2,412,072. This patent relates primarily to certain specific downhole completions equipment. The plaintiff requested a permanent injunction against further alleged infringement, damages in an unspecified amount, supplemental and enhanced damages, and additional relief such as attorney's fees and costs. Trial on the validity of asserted claims from Canada patent 2,412,072, was completed March 9, 2017. On December 7, 2017, the Canadian Court issued its judgment finding the patent claims asserted from Canada patent 2,412,072 against Baker Hughes Canada Company were invalid. On January 5, 2018, Rapid Completions filed its Notice of Appeal of the Canadian Court\u2019s judgment of invalidity. On April 24, 2019, the Canadian Court of Appeals ruled against Rapid Completions and dismissed Rapid Completion\u2019s appeal in Canada. On June 24, 2019, Rapid Completions filed an application for leave to appeal the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. On December 19, 2019, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed Rapid Completion's appeal.\nIn January 2013, INEOS and Naphtachimie initiated expertise proceedings in Aix-en-Provence, France arising out of a fire at a chemical plant owned by INEOS in Lavera, France, which resulted in a 15-day plant shutdown and destruction of a steam turbine, which was part of a compressor train owned by Naphtachimie. The most recent quantification of the alleged damages is \u20ac250 million. 2 of the Company's subsidiaries (and 17 other companies) were notified to participate in the proceedings. The proceedings are ongoing, and at this time, there is no indication that the Company's subsidiaries were involved in the incident. Although the outcome of the claims remains uncertain, our insurer has accepted coverage and is defending the Company in the expertise proceeding.\nIn late November 2017, staff of the Boston office of the SEC notified GE that they are conducting an investigation of GE\u2019s revenue recognition practices and internal controls over financial reporting related to long-term service agreements. The scope of the SEC\u2019s request may include some Baker Hughes contracts, expected to be mainly in our TPS business. We have provided all requested documents to GE. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this review.\nOn July 31, 2018, International Engineering & Construction S.A. (IEC) initiated arbitration proceedings in New York administered by the International Center for Dispute Resolution (ICDR) against the Company and its subsidiaries arising out of a series of sales and service contracts entered between IEC and the Company\u2019s subsidiaries for the sale and installation of LNG plants and related power generation equipment in Nigeria (Contracts). Prior to the filing of the IEC Arbitration, the Company\u2019s subsidiaries made demands for payment due under the Contracts. On August 15, 2018, the Company\u2019s subsidiaries initiated a separate demand for ICDR arbitration against IEC for claims of additional costs and amounts due under the Contracts. On October 10, 2018, IEC filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company seeking to compel non-signatory Baker Hughes entities to participate in the arbitration filed by IEC. The complaint is captioned International Engineering & Construction S.A. et al. v. Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC, et al. No. 18-cv-09241 (S.D.N.Y 2018); this action was dismissed by the Court on August 13, 2019. In the arbitration, IEC alleges breach of contract and other claims against the Company and its subsidiaries and seeks recovery of alleged compensatory damages, in addition to reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and arbitration costs. On March 15, 2019, IEC amended its request for arbitration to alleged damages of $591 million of\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 97\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nlost profits plus unspecified additional costs based on alleged non-performance of the contracts in dispute. The arbitration hearing was held from December 9, 2019 to December 20, 2019. The Company and its subsidiaries have contested IEC\u2019s claims and are pursuing claims for compensation under the contracts. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of these claims.\nOn March 15, 2019 and March 18, 2019, the City of Riviera Beach Pension Fund and Richard Schippnick, respectively, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery shareholder derivative lawsuits for and on the Company\u2019s behalf against GE, the then-current members of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Company as a nominal defendant, related to the decision to (i) terminate the contractual prohibition barring GE from selling any of the Company\u2019s shares before July 3, 2019; (ii) repurchase $1.5 billion in the Company\u2019s stock from GE; (iii) permit GE to sell approximately $2.5 billion in the Company\u2019s stock through a secondary offering; and (iv) enter into a series of other agreements and amendments that will govern the ongoing relationship between the Company and GE (collectively, the \u201c2018 Transactions\u201d). The complaints in both lawsuits allege, among other things, that GE, as the Company\u2019s controlling stockholder, and the members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the 2018 Transactions. The relief sought in the complaints includes a request for a declaration that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, that GE was unjustly enriched, disgorgement of profits, an award of damages sustained by the Company, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On March 21, 2019, the Chancery Court entered an order consolidating the Schippnick and City of Riviera Beach complaints under consolidated C.A. No. 2019-0201-AGB, styled in re Baker Hughes, a GE company derivative litigation. On May 10, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the members of the Company\u2019s Conflicts Committee, and on May 15, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against former Baker Hughes director Martin Craighead. On June 7, 2019, the defendants and nominal defendant filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the derivative plaintiffs failed to make a demand on the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to pursue the claims itself, and GE and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The Chancery Court denied the motions on October 8, 2019, except granted GE\u2019s motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim against it. On October 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors designated a Special Litigation Committee and empowered it with full authority to investigate and evaluate the allegations and issues raised in the derivative litigation. The Special Litigation Committee filed a motion to stay the derivative litigation during its investigation. On December 3, 2019, the Chancery Court granted the motion and stayed the derivative litigation until June 1, 2020. The Special Litigation Committee\u2019s investigation and evaluation remains ongoing. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the Special Litigation Committee investigation or these claims.\nIn March 2019, the Company received a document request from the United States Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) related to certain of the Company\u2019s operations in Iraq and its dealings with Unaoil Limited and its affiliates. In December 2019, the Company received a similar document request from the Securities Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The Company is cooperating with the DOJ and SEC in connection with their requests and any related matters. In addition, the Company has agreed to toll any statute of limitations in connection with the matters subject to the DOJ\u2019s document request.\nOn May 7, 2019, the Alaska District Attorney filed a Criminal Information against Baker Hughes Incorporated, Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc., Baker Petrolite Corporation and a Baker Hughes employee alleging that individuals working at a Baker Petrolite Corporation chemical transfer facility in Kenai, Alaska were exposed to hazardous air emissions. The Criminal Information charges six counts of Assault in the Third Degree, three counts of Assault in the Fourth Degree and Negligent Air Emissions. On July 22, 2019, the six counts of Assault in the Third Degree were dismissed, with the Alaska Attorney General\u2019s office indicating their intent to present those charges to the grand jury to obtain an indictment. On or around September 11, 2019, the grand jury issued an indictment on 25 counts, including 10 counts of Assault in the First Degree, 10 counts of Assault in the Second Degree, and 5 counts of Assault in the Third Degree. On or around December 3, 2019, the State agreed to dismiss the indictment against Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc. The Company and other Defendants have pled not guilty and intend to defend the charges. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the criminal proceeding.\nOn August 13, 2019, Tri-State Joint Fund filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, a shareholder class action lawsuit for and on the behalf of itself and all similarly situated public stockholders of Baker Hughes Incorporated (\u201cBHI\u201d) against the General Electric Company, the former members of the Board of Directors of BHI, and certain\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 98\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nformer BHI Officers alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, and other claims in connection with the Transactions. On October 28, 2019, City of Providence filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery a shareholder class action lawsuit for and on behalf of itself and all similarly situated public shareholders of BHI against GE, the former members of the Board of Directors of BHI, and certain former BHI Officers alleging substantially the same claims in connection with the Transactions. The relief sought in these complaints include a request for a declaration that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, an award of damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The lawsuits have been consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint on December 17, 2019 against certain former BHI officers alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and against GE for aiding and abetting those breaches. The December 2019 complaint omitted the former members of the Board of Directors of BHI, except for Mr. Craighead who also served as President and CEO of BHI. Mr. Craighead and Ms. Ross, who served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of BHI, remain named in the December 2019 complaint along with GE. The relief sought in the consolidated complaint includes a declaration that the former BHI officers breached their fiduciary duties and that GE aided and abetted those breaches, an award of damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of these claims.\nOn December 11, 2019, BMC Software, Inc. (\u201cBMC\u201d) filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Southern District of Texas against Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, and unjust enrichment, arising out of the Company\u2019s use of its new logo and affiliated branding. On January 1, 2020, BMC amended its complaint to add Baker Hughes Company. The relief sought in the complaint includes a request for injunctive relief, an award of damages (including punitive damages), pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of these claims.\nWe insure against risks arising from our business to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending or future legal proceedings or other claims. Most of our insurance policies contain deductibles or self-insured retentions in amounts we deem prudent and for which we are responsible for payment. In determining the amount of self-insurance, it is our policy to self-insure those losses that are predictable, measurable and recurring in nature, such as claims for automobile liability, general liability and workers compensation.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nEstimated remediation costs are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and enacted laws and regulations. Our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. Accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such costs can be reasonably estimated. As additional information becomes available, accruals are adjusted to reflect current cost estimates. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred. Where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in a U.S. federal or state Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) site, we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs of the site. This share is based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site.\nOTHER\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also had commitments outstanding for purchase obligations for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2024 of $1,304 million, $170 million, $61 million, $9 million and $12 million, respectively, and $15 million in the aggregate thereafter.\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects primarily in our Oilfield Equipment segment. Under such arrangements, each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 99\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nwithin the total scope of the contracted work, and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed. The failure or inability, financially or otherwise, of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us. These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project, liquidated damages or contract disputes.\nNOTE 21. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER\nWe recorded restructuring, impairment and other charges of $342 million, $433 million, and $412 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Details of these charges are discussed below.\nRESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\nIn the current and prior periods, we approved various restructuring plans globally, mainly to consolidate manufacturing and service facilities, rationalize product lines and rooftops, and reduce headcount across various functions. As a result, we recognized a charge of $314 million, $304 million and $385 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These restructuring initiatives are expected to generate charges of approximately $11 million in future periods as these restructuring plans come to completion.\nThese charges are included in the \"Restructuring, impairment and other\" caption in the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss).\nThe amount of costs not included in the reported segment results is as follows:\nOilfield Services\n$\n$\n$\nOilfield Equipment\nTurbomachinery & Process Solutions\nDigital Solutions\nCorporate\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\nThese costs were primarily related to employee termination benefits, product line terminations, plant closures and related expenses such as property, plant and equipment impairments, contract terminations, and other incremental costs that were a direct result of the restructuring plans.\nProperty, plant & equipment, net\n$\n$\n$\nEmployee-related termination expenses\nAsset relocation costs\nEHS remediation costs\nContract termination fees\nOther incremental costs\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\nOTHER CHARGES\nOther charges included in \"Restructuring, impairment and other\" caption of the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss) was $28 million, $129 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2019, such items primarily relate to currency devaluations in our OFS segment. In 2018, other charges consist primarily of accelerated amortization of $80 million related to trade names and technology in our OFS segment, litigation charges of $25 million in Corporate and costs of $13 million to exit certain operations that impacted our TPS and OFS segments. In 2017, other charges primarily relate to currency devaluations of $12 million.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 100\nBaker Hughes Company\nNotes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\nNOTE 22. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nAll Other Current Liabilities\nAll other current liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 include $1,121 million and $955 million, respectively, of employee related liabilities.\nProduct Warranties\nWe provide for estimated product warranty expenses when we sell the related products. Because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information, primarily historical claims experience, claims costs may differ from amounts provided.
