Sky also owns premium sports channels under the Sky Sports brand and premium movie channels under the Sky Cinema brand, including family and children\u2019s movie channels. Sky also broadcasts several Sky branded free-to-air channels, including Sky News and Sky Arts in the United Kingdom and Ireland, Sky TG24 in Italy and Sky Sport News in Germany.\nSky licenses the rights to use content for owned channels from third parties, in some cases on an exclusive basis. Sky has various contractual commitments for the licensing of rights to multiyear programming, primarily sports rights and exclusive entertainment content. Our most significant sports rights commitments include the U.K. broadcast rights for English Premier League soccer games through 2022; German broadcast rights to Bundesliga through 2025 and Union des Associations Europ\u00e9ennes de Football Champions League (\u201cUCL\u201d) through 2021; and Italian broadcast rights to UCL and Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A through 2021. Our most significant commitments for the license of entertainment content include exclusive rights with HBO, Showtime, Warner Bros., NBCUniversal and Sony. Sky is also increasingly creating and investing in original scripted content that is broadcast across all of its territories and sold to other markets.\nIn addition to including owned channels as part of its video services, Sky distributes some of its owned channels on third-party platforms through both wholesale arrangements and arrangements with partners who distribute Sky\u2019s owned channels as agents to their respective customer bases. Additionally, Sky licenses owned and licensed content to third-party video providers and Peacock.\nAdvertising\nSky sells advertising and sponsorships across its owned television channels and where it represents the sales efforts of third-party channels. Sky also sells advertising on its digital platforms and offers various technology, tools and solutions relating to its advertising business.\nOther Services\nSky offers high-speed internet and voice services in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Sky offers fiber-to-the-cabinet, standard copper digital subscriber line (\u201cDSL\u201d) broadband and fiber-to-the-home (\u201cFTTH\u201d) services, with download speeds up to 160 megabits per second in the United Kingdom and up to 1 Gbps in Ireland. In the United Kingdom, Sky uses a combination of its own core fiber network and wholesaling arrangements over third-party telecommunication providers\u2019 networks as the core network and also accesses the \u201clast mile\u201d network from third-party network operators for a fee to provide its services to customers. In Italy, Sky launched FTTH services in June 2020 using Open Fiber\u2019s network to provide high-speed internet access and voice services. Sky offers wireless phone services to customers in the United Kingdom using a combination of its own core fiber network and an arrangement to access network assets from Telef\u00f3nica.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTechnology and Sources of Supply\nFor a majority of customers, Sky\u2019s DTH video platform is delivered via one-way digital satellite transmission for the distribution of linear television channels, augmented by a set-top box with local DVR storage and high speed two-way broadband connectivity to provide access to a broad range of On Demand and other services. The Sky platform also incorporates Wi-Fi connectivity for in-home distribution enabling wireless multi-room consumption, and Sky has also developed a range of back-end and client software applications that provide customers with access to its content across multiple third-party devices and On Demand in and out of the home. Sky\u2019s DTC streaming service is delivered via the internet.\nSky continues to focus on technology initiatives to design, develop and deploy next-generation media and content delivery platforms, including Sky Q and Sky\u2019s DTC streaming service, that deliver video content, provide advanced search capabilities, including through a voice-activated remote control, and provide access to certain other DTC streaming services.\nSky relies on various telecommunications providers to deliver video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellites leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, pursuant to the current regulatory regime in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy, Sky is able to access networks owned by third-party telecommunication providers for a fee to provide its high-speed internet and voice services in many cases, on regulated terms. Additionally, Sky purchases from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of set-top boxes and certain other customer premise equipment to provide its video and high-speed internet services. Sky also purchases from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches that are sold to customers who receive our wireless phone services.\nTo offer video services, in addition to its owned channels, Sky licenses programming from third-parties that operate television channels. Sky attempts to secure long-term programming distribution agreements with these providers. The fees associated with these distribution agreements are generally based on the number of customers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which Sky provides the content. Sky seeks to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through On Demand services, mobile apps and DTC streaming services.\nCustomer and Home Services\nSky\u2019s customer service operations are increasingly a digital first offering. The home service group performs various tasks, including installing, servicing and performing upgrades of customer premise equipment.\nSales and Marketing\nSky offers direct-to-consumer services to retail customers through customer service call centers, websites, telemarketing, a limited number of retail outlets, as well as through advertising via direct mail, television and the internet.\nCorporate and Other\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Peacock.\nPeacock is our new premium ad-supported direct-to-consumer video on demand streaming service featuring NBCUniversal content including exclusive Peacock originals, current NBC and Telemundo shows, news, late-night comedy, live sports and a library of television shows and movies, providing customers access to tens of thousands of hours of programming. Customers have the choice of three tiers of service: a free, ad-supported version; a subscription based, ad-supported version with access to all Peacock content; and a similar subscription-based, ad-free version. The subscription-based, ad-supported version is offered to Cable Communications X1 and Flex customers and similar customers at Cox Communications for no additional charge. In addition to NBCUniversal\u2019s owned content, Peacock also includes content licensed from third parties.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 10\nCompetition\nAll of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes high-speed internet services more important to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been viewed by consumers. This increase has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines at our programming channels.\nCable Communications Segment\nCompetition for Cable Communications\u2019 services consists primarily of phone companies with fiber-based networks and direct broadcast satellite (\u201cDBS\u201d) providers that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours.\nHigh-Speed Internet\nCable Communications competes with a number of companies offering internet services, including:\n\u2022wireline phone companies and other providers of wireline internet service\n\u2022wireless phone companies and other providers of wireless internet service\n\u2022municipal broadband networks and power companies\n\u2022satellite broadband providers\nPhone companies such as AT&T, Frontier, Lumen and Verizon have built and are continuing to build fiber-based network infrastructure farther into their networks, which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional DSL technology, and are offering these higher-speed services in many of our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our high-speed internet services.\nCertain other companies have launched FTTH networks that provide high-speed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate, and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiber-based networks.\nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types, including 3G and 4G, and 5G which continues to be available only in limited locations, wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks. These networks work with devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and mobile and fixed wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized Wi-Fi and other internet access networks. The availability of wireless and other offerings could negatively impact the demand for our high-speed internet services.\nVideo\nCable Communications competes with a number of different sources in the United States that provide news, sports, information and entertainment programming to consumers, including:\n\u2022DBS providers, including AT&T\u2019s DIRECTV and DISH Network, that transmit satellite signals to substantially all U.S. households to provide video programming and other information similar to our video services\n\u2022phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, that have built and continue to build fiber-based networks that provide services similar to ours, which overlap a substantial portion of our service areas, and that in some cases provide bundled offerings that include wireless phone services\n\u2022DTC streaming and other over-the-top (\u201cOTT\u201d) service providers including:\n\u25e6subscription-based services, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu and Netflix, that offer online services and devices that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\u25e6virtual multichannel video providers who offer streaming services for linear programming that generally involve smaller packages of programming networks at prices lower than our traditional video service package offerings\n\u2022other providers that build and operate wireline communications systems in the same communities that we serve, including those operating as franchised cable operators\n\u2022satellite master antenna television systems that offer to their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems and generally serve multiple dwelling units (\u201cMDUs\u201d), office complexes and residential developments\n\u2022other companies, such as local broadcast television stations, that provide multiple channels of free over-the-air programming, as well as video rental services and home entertainment and gaming products\nMany of these competitors also have significant financial resources and have further intensified competition through mergers and acquisitions.\nVoice\nCable Communications competes with wireline and wireless phone companies, including incumbent local exchange carriers (\u201cILECs\u201d) and competitive local exchange carriers (\u201cCLECs\u201d), and other internet-based and VoIP service providers. Certain phone companies, such as the ILECs AT&T and Verizon, have longstanding customer relationships, and extensive existing facilities and network rights-of-way. A few CLECs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources. In addition, we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internet-based phone services.\nWireless\nCable Communications competes with national wireless phone service providers in the United States, including AT&T and Verizon, which offer wireless service on both a standalone basis or along with other services as bundled offerings, as well as regional providers of wireless communications services.\nBusiness Services\nCable Communications primarily competes with a variety of phone companies, including ILECs and CLECs and wide area network managed service providers. These companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier\u2019s network. We also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and VoIP companies that target businesses of all sizes. Our video monitoring services compete with companies that provide video surveillance services that use both traditional and cloud-based/digital solutions.\nNBCUniversal Segments\nCable Networks and Broadcast Television\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers\u2019 attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers, including cable, broadcast and premium networks; DTC streaming and other OTT service providers; local broadcast television stations; home entertainment products; pay-per-view and video on demand services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks, DTC streaming service providers, and local television stations. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 12\nIn addition, NBCUniversal\u2019s cable television and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties, for creative, performing and technical personnel, and for distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content.\nFilmed Entertainment\nFilmed Entertainment competes for audiences for films and other entertainment content with other major studios and independent film producers, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of Filmed Entertainment primarily depends on the number of films produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Filmed Entertainment also competes to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors and producers, as well as scripts for films. We also compete with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of films in theaters and on demand, and the distribution of films on premium networks, and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\nTheme Parks\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. To help maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks, we have invested and continue to invest significant amounts in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing, China and Orlando, Florida.\nSky Segment\nSky competes with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services, Sky competes with cable operators, providers of both paid-for and free-to-air programming, other satellite television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of news, information, sports and entertainment that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For high-speed internet and wireless services, Sky also competes with service providers making use of new fiber optic networks, telecommunications providers, other internet service providers and companies developing new technologies and devices. Sky\u2019s competitive position may be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. Sky also competes with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\nSky\u2019s owned channels compete for the acquisition of programming content with a wide range of providers, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such programming is significant.\nAdvertising\nCable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Sky and Peacock compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital, radio and print media. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at the related networks, stations or channels. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. In addition, advertising revenue is adversely affected by the growing use of technologies, such as DVRs and video on demand services, which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or to fast-forward or skip advertisements within programming.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications\u2019 results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nRevenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains) are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, which affect Cable Networks and Broadcast Television, and the Super Bowl, which affects Broadcast Television. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively. Revenue in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue at Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World CupTM.\nRevenue in Filmed Entertainment fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. Content licensing revenue in Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees.\nRevenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Theme Parks generally experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the Christmas holiday season.\nSky\u2019s results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our DTH and DTC streaming services, including the start of the new soccer seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the second half of each year due to higher marketing expenses.\nExclusive sports rights, such as European soccer, play a key role within Sky\u2019s wider content strategy. In Europe, broadcasting rights for major sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality for Sky, although the staggered timing of major sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market. Certain of Sky\u2019s significant sports rights agreements require payments at the start of each season, resulting in increases in sports rights payments in the third and fourth quarter of each year.\nLegislation and Regulation\nWhile all of our businesses are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, compliance with certain laws and regulations is most material with respect to our Cable Communications and Broadcast Television businesses in the United States. Specifically, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d), and Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our cable communications and broadcast businesses in the United States, and these businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal, state and local authorities. In addition, our international businesses are subject to the laws and the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate.\nBeyond any significant regulations summarized below, legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome, and they, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews, regarding our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and open internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 14\nLegislative and regulatory activity may increase with the change in administration following the 2020 U.S. presidential election. For example, the U.S. Congress may consider proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace, whether it should enact new, permanent open internet/net neutrality requirements, and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure or broadband connectivity initiatives. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs. In addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws or enact new competition laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. With the change in administration, tax legislation could be enacted increasing the federal corporate income tax from the current rate of 21%. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.\nThe following paragraphs summarize the significant legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses.\nCommunications-Related Regulations in the United States\nHigh-Speed Internet\nOur high-speed internet services are subject to a number of regulations and commitments. The FCC frequently considers imposing new broadband-related regulations such as those relating to an Open Internet. States and localities also consider new broadband-related regulations, including those regarding government-owned broadband networks, net neutrality and connectivity during COVID-19. New broadband regulations, if adopted, may have adverse effects on our businesses. In addition, as an internet service provider (\u201cISP\u201d), we must implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity. From time to time, the FCC considers imposing new regulatory obligations on ISPs.\nOpen Internet Regulations\nVarious forms of Open Internet regulations can significantly affect our high-speed internet services. In 2017, the FCC reversed its prior classification of broadband internet access service as a Title II \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under the Communications Act and classified it as an \u201cinformation service\u201d under Title I. In addition, it eliminated its prior \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules prohibiting ISPs from blocking access to lawful content on the internet; impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services (\u201cthrottling\u201d); prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration or in favor of an affiliate (\u201cpaid or affiliated prioritization\u201d); and generally prohibiting ISPs from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers\u2019 ability to access and use the lawful internet content, applications, services or devices of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging edge providers\u2019 ability to make lawful content, applications, services or devices available to consumers (\u201cgeneral conduct standard\u201d). The FCC stated that jurisdiction to regulate ISP conduct would rest at the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and it expressly preempted all state Open Internet laws. In addition, the FCC revised the transparency rule to add a requirement that ISPs disclose any blocking and throttling practices, and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings. We have disclosed that we do not block, throttle or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization, and have committed not to block, throttle or discriminate against lawful content. The FTC has authority to enforce these public commitments, and the FCC has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule.\nThe FCC\u2019s 2017 decision was challenged, and in 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia largely upheld the FCC\u2019s decision, including the classification of broadband as a Title I information service and repeal of its prior rules. However, it vacated the FCC\u2019s express preemption of all state Open Internet laws, but noted that state laws may nevertheless be preempted on a case-by-case basis if those regulations conflict with federal law or policy or under other theories and precedent on implied preemption.\nSeveral states have passed or introduced legislation, or have adopted executive orders, that impose Open Internet requirements in a variety of ways, and new state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future. Certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court. Such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create differing and/or conflicting state regulations.\nThe FCC under the new Administration likely will revisit the regulatory classification of broadband internet access service and reclassify broadband internet access service as a \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d which would authorize the FCC to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Under a Title II framework, the FCC could potentially regulate our customer rates, speeds, data usage thresholds or other terms for internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and internet content, applications and service providers, including backbone\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\ninterconnection arrangements. Any FCC action could impact state Open Internet initiatives and related legal challenges, and also could prompt further litigation. Congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services. We cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed, the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation.\nBroadband Deployment/Infrastructure Initiatives\nBeginning in 2018, the FCC adopted a series of orders aimed at removing barriers to the deployment of broadband infrastructure, including the preemption of certain state and local laws or regulations that may unreasonably impede the deployment of wireless broadband networks. Over time, these orders may have the effect of creating regulatory imbalances that favor wireless services over wireline broadband services like our own. We cannot predict the extent to which the FCC might adopt similar orders in the future, whether such future orders would be upheld if appealed, how state or local laws or regulations may be impacted or how such changes may affect our business.\nThere also have been, and may continue to be, broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts, that could subsidize other service providers building networks within our footprint or potentially subsidize expansion of our network to new areas. We cannot predict how such funds will be awarded or the impact of these initiatives on our businesses.\nMunicipally Owned Broadband Networks\nA number of local municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create government-owned networks. Certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of government-owned networks, although some may choose to ease or facilitate such networks. We cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our businesses.\nVideo\nThe video marketplace is quickly evolving and continues to become even more competitive, particularly as new DTC streaming and other OTT service providers enter the market at a growing pace. There are a number of laws and regulations that apply solely to multichannel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d) or cable operators, and to cable networks and local broadcast television stations. These laws and regulations can constrain our ability to compete, particularly against new online providers, which are not subject to these same requirements.\nCable Pricing and Packaging\nWhile the vast majority of our video services, including equipment and installation fees, are no longer subject to rate regulation by the FCC, certain state entities monitor and challenge in court the marketing and advertising of our services, and some have attempted to regulate the service packages we offer and our billing practices. We cannot predict the outcome of any current litigation with state entities or whether other states may pursue similar actions.\nCable Franchising\nCable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities. While the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, franchises typically last for a fixed term, obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality, customer service and other requirements, and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. Franchising authorities also may require adequate channel capacity, facilities and financial support for public, educational and governmental access programming, and other in-kind contributions.\nThe Communications Act also contains provisions governing the franchising process, including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal and unreasonable renewal conditions. We believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise. The FCC adopted an order in 2019 that prohibits state and local authorities from imposing duplicative franchise and/or fee requirements on the provision of broadband and other non-cable services over franchised cable systems, and ruling that in-kind contributions are treated as franchise fees subject to the statutory cap on franchise fees of 5% of cable service revenue unless those contributions are expressly excluded by the Communications Act. The order has been appealed, and we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation.\nProgram Carriage\nFCC regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its non-affiliation in the selection, terms or conditions for its carriage. In addition, cable operators and other MVPDs in the United States are prohibited from requiring as a condition of\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 16\ncarriage a financial interest in, or exclusive distribution rights for, a video programming network. We have been involved in program carriage disputes at the FCC, as well as in the courts, and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\nProgram Access\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing MVPDs. The FCC and Congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with MVPDs and potentially with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers; Maine has enacted a law mandating retail a la carte distribution by cable operators that may have similar effects. The Maine statute has been appealed and is currently stayed by the courts, but we cannot predict the outcome of that litigation. We currently offer our cable networks on a packaged basis (in \u201ctiers\u201d) and, in various cases, individually. We have been involved in program access disputes at the FCC and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\nMust-Carry/Retransmission Consent\nCable operators are required to carry, without compensation, programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations. As an alternative to this \u201cmust-carry\u201d requirement, local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for \u201cretransmission consent,\u201d under which the station gives up its must-carry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator, which frequently will involve payments to the station. We currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations\u2019 broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. Failure to reach a retransmission consent agreement with a broadcaster could result in the loss of popular programming on our video services.\nWith respect to our Broadcast Television business, every three years, each local commercial broadcast television station must elect for each cable system in its DMA either must carry or retransmission consent. A similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers. For the three-year period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020, all of our owned NBC and Telemundo local broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent. The next three-year period will commence on January 1, 2021, for which elections were made by October 1, 2020. All of our owned NBC and Telemundo local broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent. Although we have reached retransmission consent agreements with almost all MVPDs in the past, there can be no assurance that we will always be able to renew those agreements under favorable terms or at all.\nBroadcast Licensing\nLocal broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time, which may be renewed with or without conditions. The FCC renewed all of our broadcast television station licenses without conditions during the last license renewal cycle; the current television license renewal cycle began in 2020. Although our licenses have been renewed in prior cycles, there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants.\nBroadcast Ownership Restrictions\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations impose certain limitations on local and national television ownership, as well as limits on foreign ownership in a broadcast television station. Some of these limitations currently are under review in the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition, each of the four major broadcast television networks - ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC - is prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four.\nChildren\u2019s Programming\nUnder federal regulations, the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks, broadcast networks and local broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children 12 years of age and under is limited, and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under.\nFCC 5G Spectrum Proceedings\nThe FCC also has established or is in the process of evaluating and potentially modifying its rules to make available additional spectrum that will likely be used for licensed and unlicensed commercial services, including new 5G services, some of which has been or is in the process of being auctioned by the FCC. Because Cable Communications and NBCUniversal both use some of this spectrum to provide services, they must transition their operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for 5G, which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nVoice\nWe provide voice services using VoIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information, local number portability duties and benefits, disability access, E911, law enforcement assistance, outage reporting, Universal Service Fund contribution obligations, rural call completion, customer equipment back-up power, robocall mitigation, service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements. The FCC has not yet ruled on whether VoIP services such as ours should be classified as an \u201cinformation service\u201d or a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under the Communications Act. The classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services. One federal court of appeals in the 8th Circuit has held that VoIP is an information service and preempted state regulation of VoIP, and the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to review that determination, but that ruling remains limited to the seven states located in that circuit. State regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of VoIP remains unsettled at the federal level.\nWireless\nWe offer a wireless voice and data service using our MVNO rights to provide the service over Verizon\u2019s wireless network. MVNOs are subject to many of the same FCC regulations as facilities-based wireless carriers (e.g., E911 services, local number portability, etc.), as well as certain state or local regulations. The FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile broadband providers in the future, which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally.\nInternational Communications-Related Regulations\nSky and certain NBCUniversal international businesses are subject to telecommunications and media-specific regulation described below in Europe, Latin America and other international jurisdictions, and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws, such as competition, consumer protection, data protection and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate. Our international businesses are currently, and may be in the future, subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Sky, we have made certain legally binding commitments with respect to Sky\u2019s operations, including for example, to maintain annual funding for Sky News in an amount no lower than Sky News\u2019 2017 fiscal year expenditures, as adjusted by inflation, until 2029.\nPlatform Services\nIn the United Kingdom, Sky is required to ensure that agreements to provide its electronic program guide (\u201cEPG\u201d) and conditional access (\u201cCA\u201d) services to other programming providers are on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, among other things, so that those providers\u2019 content is available on Sky\u2019s satellite platform via the EPG on set-top boxes. Sky also has voluntarily committed to the United Kingdom\u2019s communications regulator, the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, to provide access control services to third parties that enable them to provide interactive services. Sky is subject to similar EPG and CA obligations in Germany.\nTelevision Channels\nSky and NBCUniversal hold a number of licenses and authorizations for their portfolios of television channels. For example, in the United Kingdom, Sky is subject to various codes issued by Ofcom affecting the content and delivery of these channels. Sky and NBCUniversal also hold various broadcast licenses in certain E.U. countries and NBCUniversal holds broadcast licenses in various countries for its international cable networks, and must comply with rules and regulations covering issues such as the acquisition and exploitation of sports rights, media concentration and plurality, television advertising, the protection of children, accessibility, airtime for commercials and teleshopping, sponsorship and ensuring clear distinctions between program content and advertising.\nHigh-Speed Internet and Voice\nSky provides broadband and voice services in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy pursuant to wholesale distribution agreements that third-party broadband and telecommunications companies either make available commercially or are required to make available under applicable laws in those jurisdictions. Material changes to these regulations could affect Sky\u2019s business. Sky is also subject to E.U. open internet/net neutrality regulations, which prohibit the blocking, throttling or discrimination of online content, applications and services and require ISPs to disclose their traffic management, throughput limitations and other practices impacting quality of service in customer contracts.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 18\nOther Areas of Regulation\nIntellectual Property\nCopyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary-rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, counterfeit DVDs and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal protections exist to combat such practices, the extent of copyright protection is sometimes ambiguous and the use of technological protections can be controversial. Modifications to existing laws, a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of existing laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\nU.S. copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. We also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute. The cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition, the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing, and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\nPrivacy and Data Security Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of consumers\u2019 personal information. In the United States, the Communications Act generally restricts cable operators\u2019 nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers\u2019 personally identifiable information, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests. We are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services.\nThe FTC generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices. For example, the FTC often partners with state attorneys general to update or enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information. These efforts may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required in connection with the collection, use or sharing of personal information. We are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and under.\nIn addition, certain states have enacted detailed laws establishing consumer privacy protections and data security requirements in their respective states. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) gives California residents rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use and sharing of \u201cPersonal Information,\u201d as well as rights to access, delete and restrict the sale of certain personal information collected about them. Moreover, all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which broadly regulates the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union GDPR, and the Member States\u2019 legislation implementing the GDPR, affect our ability to process certain personal data. Moreover, the outcome of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (discussed more broadly below) could affect our ability to process certain data.\nPrivacy and data security remained a priority legislative issue in 2020. For example, California voters enacted updates to the CCPA via a ballot initiative called the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d). Among other things, the CPRA creates an entirely new state-level agency for overseeing consumer privacy issues. Changes enacted in the CPRA generally go into effect on January 1, 2023, though several aspects of the law remain subject to further rulemaking. We cannot predict how these changes to the law will affect our business. There are several federal and state legislative proposals that, if enacted, could create new consumer privacy protections or impose new requirements on entities that collect and use consumer personal information, including us. We cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted at the federal or state level and, if so, the impact of any such laws on our business.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nState and Local Taxes\nSome U.S. states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing, through both legislative and administrative channels, new or additional taxes or fees on, or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by, the businesses operated by our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes, fees, incentives or credits are computed, earned or monetized. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments. In some situations, DBS providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a high-speed internet connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these DBS providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (\u201cITFA\u201d) prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges; however, some jurisdictions may challenge the ITFA or the application of the ITFA to our business, or may assert that certain taxes akin to right-of-way fees are not preempted by the ITFA.\nU.K. Exit from the European Union\nThe telecommunications and media regulatory framework applicable to our business in the United Kingdom may be subject to greater uncertainty as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020, with the possibility of greater divergence between the regulation of our U.K. business and that of our other European businesses over time. We are not able to predict the extent of any such divergence at this point in time.\nOther Regulations\nU.S. states and localities, and various regulatory authorities actively regulate other aspects of our businesses, including our Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks businesses, accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities, customer service standards, inside wiring, cable equipment, pole attachments, universal service fees, public safety, telemarketing, leased access, indecency, loudness of commercial advertisements, advertising, political broadcasting, sponsorship identification, Emergency Alert System, equal employment opportunity and other employment-related laws, environmental-related matters, regulatory fees, our equipment supply chain and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various international regulations, including those that cover television broadcasting, programming and advertising. We are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities, which can result in us having to pay fines or being subject to other sanctions.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 168,000 full-time and part-time employees calculated on a full-time equivalent basis. Of these employees, approximately 82,000, 49,000 and 34,000 were associated with Cable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky, respectively. Approximately 25% of these employees were located in over 30 countries outside the United States, with larger workforce concentrations in the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy and Germany. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business. A small overall portion of our full-time U.S. employees are unionized; outside the United States, employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.\nAs a global media and technology company, we have a wide range of employees, including management professionals, technicians, engineers, call center employees, theme park employees and a wide range of media talent and production employees. Given the breadth of our employee base, we tailor our human capital management policies with a view to specific employee populations. However, we provide a wide variety of opportunities for professional growth for all employees with in-classroom and online trainings, on-the-job experience, education tuition assistance and counseling, and financial counseling and literacy training. We seek to create an engaged workforce through proactive listening and constructive dialogue, including through employee engagement surveys and employee resource groups, and continue to have a strong focus on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 20\nWe focus on attracting and retaining employees by providing compensation and benefits packages that are competitive within the applicable market, taking into account the job position\u2019s location and responsibilities. We provide competitive financial benefits such as a 401(k) retirement plan in the United States with a company match, have employee stock purchase plans in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland and several other European countries where most of our full-time and part-time employees can purchase our stock at a discount, and offer a portfolio of services and tools to support our employees\u2019 health and wellbeing. We also generally grant awards of restricted stock units and stock options on an annual basis to a meaningful portion of our employees, with over 18,000 employees receiving such awards in 2020.\nIn 2020, in response to COVID-19, we committed over $500 million to support employees where operations were closed or impacted, made work from home options as broadly available as possible, and enhanced safety measures for customer-facing employees. In response to the impacts of COVID-19 and the changing environment in which we are operating our businesses, we also implemented temporary workforce reductions, including employee furloughs at our theme parks, and incurred severance at some of our businesses. Refer to Item 7: Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company\u2019s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d by words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d or \u201ccontinue,\u201d or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and in other reports we file with the SEC.\nAdditionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and, particularly in view of new technologies, the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any of such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.\nThe impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. While our Cable Communications results were strong in 2020, they were negatively affected by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions and by costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as people increasingly worked and learned remotely from home. COVID-19 had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations during 2020. For example, in late February we temporarily closed our theme park in Japan, and in mid-March we temporarily closed our theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood, and although our parks in Orlando and Japan reopened with limited capacity in June 2020, our park in Hollywood remains closed. We cannot predict when the Hollywood park will reopen, if any reopened parks will remain open or estimate attendance levels at any of the parks. We expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term. The creation and availability of our film and television programming globally have been and will continue to be disrupted, including as a result of the postponement or cancellation of sporting events (such as the professional soccer, hockey, baseball and basketball leagues and the Olympics), theatrical closures and the suspension of entertainment content production. We expect any continued deterioration of global economic conditions would result in lower advertising revenues and consumer spending across our businesses.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our businesses also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect day-to-day life and the length of time that such measures remain in place to respond to COVID-19, further deterioration of the global economy and the widespread availability of a vaccine. At this point, it is impossible to predict such extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected.\nCOVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.\nAll of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services as well as entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Some established DTC streaming and other OTT service providers have become core competitors to our video services and more continue to enter the market at a growing pace.\nFor example:\n\u2022Cable Communications\u2019 and Sky\u2019s high-speed internet services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks and DBS providers. Competition for Cable Communications\u2019 video services consists primarily of DBS providers, phone companies with fiber-based networks and increasingly DTC streaming and other OTT service providers and devices, each of which typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours, including bundled offers with high-speed internet services. Sky faces competition for its services from cable and telecommunications providers in its European markets, many of which offer customers bundled services, which has increased competition.\n\u2022NBCUniversal and Sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, content (including sports programming) and other resources required to operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming to attract viewers.\nFor a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the \u201cCompetition\u201d discussion within that section.\nConsolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources and efficiencies of scale who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, consolidation or cooperation between phone companies (which are also wireless distributors) and content providers may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services.\nThe ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. Our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.\nWhile we continue to seek ways to enhance the value of our businesses, such as by growing high-speed internet services and business services and by investing in Peacock as the media and entertainment landscape continues to rapidly evolve, there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or operating margins or to compete successfully in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nChanges in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications\u2019 video customers and subscribers to NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks decrease, even as Cable Communications\u2019 high-speed internet services become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.\nFor example, in Europe, as more of Sky\u2019s new video customers have recently subscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to Sky\u2019s DTC streaming service instead of its traditional DTH video service. Although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our high-speed internet services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms and Flex, which more easily aggregate content from linear (i.e., traditional television channels) and\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 22\nDTC streaming and other OTT services for our customers, and by launching Peacock, our DTC streaming service, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution services continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.\nThe increase in DTC streaming and other OTT service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. NBCUniversal\u2019s revenue relatedly may be negatively impacted as traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, which pay NBCUniversal fees based on their respective numbers of customers, lose customers. Time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, reduce viewership, which has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our programming channels. Consumers in many cases have multiple options for viewing the same content; for example, content may be available through traditional linear platforms, on demand services, or a DTC streaming or OTT service, which may also result in audience rating declines. Reduced ratings may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertisers are willing to purchase from us and the amount that we receive for distribution of our content. In addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky\u2019s programming channels.\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\nA decline in advertisers\u2019 expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\nCable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, or economic conditions generally. In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media and mobile offerings, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings, which many of NBCUniversal\u2019s networks and some of Sky\u2019s television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of Peacock. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. For example, certain methods of viewing content, such as through DTC streaming or other OTT service providers or delayed viewing through DVR or on demand services, might not be fully counted in audience measurements or may generate less, if any, revenue than traditional linear television distribution methods, which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue.\nProgramming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications\u2019 video businesses.\nWe expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Cable Communications segment and to increase for the foreseeable future. Our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to more of our customers or through additional delivery platforms, such as on demand or streaming services. Additionally, Cable Communications pays certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers\u2019 rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment\u2019s results of operations.\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of Cable Communication\u2019s video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\nNBCUniversal and Sky create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content at NBCUniversal and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. We also are incurring significant costs to develop Peacock, and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace this offering.\nNBCUniversal and Sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. We also may be unable to license popular third-party content for NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s programming channels if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests (for example, they may launch DTC streaming or other OTT services for their owned content, forgo license fees from us and only provide their content directly to consumers or they may license their content on an exclusive basis to certain of our competitors or rival DTC streaming or other OTT service providers).\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs. Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability of NBCUniversal to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers. There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses may be adversely affected.\nThe loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers. Sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers. NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s ability to renew these agreements on favorable terms may be affected by recent industry consolidation and new participants entering the market for distribution of content on digital platforms.\nIncreasingly, NBCUniversal and Sky license their prior season and library content on third party distribution platforms, including to DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. If this programming does not attract sufficient viewers, these providers may not distribute NBCUniversal\u2019s or Sky\u2019s programming, and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers may not license programming NBCUniversal or Sky creates (or license it at reduced rates). In addition, we expect not to license certain popular content, and we may decide not to license additional owned popular content, to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through Peacock, which would result in foregone licensing revenue.\nNBCUniversal\u2019s broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where it does not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. In addition, every three years, each of its owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to its retransmission by multichannel video providers within its DMA, either \u201cmust-carry\u201d status, in which the distributor\u2019s carriage of the station is mandatory and does not generate any compensation for the local station, or \u201cretransmission consent,\u201d in which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and instead seeks to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage with the distributor, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to the station by such distributor.\nThere can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms. The inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses.\nLess favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky\u2019s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky\u2019s businesses.\nSky relies on various third-party telecommunications providers to deliver its video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. For example, Sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. In addition, under the current regulatory regimes in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy, Sky\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 24\naccesses networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers to offer its high-speed internet and phone services, in many cases, on regulated terms, including price. If there is a change in regulation in these markets, the regulated terms could become less favorable. Moreover, while Sky receives wholesale fiber access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, specific pricing terms are not regulated. As a result, if Sky is only able to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on less favorable terms, this would adversely affect Sky\u2019s ability to compete, and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, Sky may be unable to deliver some of its services to customers in one or more of the countries in which it operates, which would adversely affect Sky\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nOur businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses, and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.\nPiracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses, and certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us. It also presents similar challenges for Sky\u2019s businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.\nWe may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.\nWe depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we actively monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.\nWeak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers\u2019 discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\ndiscontinue subscribing to one or more of Cable Communications\u2019 or Sky\u2019s services. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming and other OTT services, or substitute services for high-speed internet and voice services, such as mobile phones and Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. In particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depend on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions (as well as natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks (such as COVID-19), terrorist attacks or other similar events).\nWeak economic conditions and disruption in the global financial markets may also have an impact on the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us or increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Sky, we incurred and assumed a significant amount of additional debt. If our businesses are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions, we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding as quickly as expected. Further, a significant increase in interest rates or disruption in the global financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, and could increase the cost of our borrowings.\nAcquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\nFrom time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, such as Peacock. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. Additionally, federal regulatory agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; political risks; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound and Euro, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. Sky\u2019s businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\nOur businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.\nOur success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors\u2019 use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. New technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways, including affecting the demand for our products, the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability. In addition, some companies and U.S. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. We expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future. If we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of Flex and Sky Q set-top boxes, wireless gateways and the development of Peacock. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors\u2019 product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 26\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations, and programming delivery, and technology embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. Cyber threats and attacks are directed at both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities and are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies. Network, information systems and technology-related events, including those caused by us, such as process breakdowns, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or power outages, natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks (such as COVID-19), terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, a reduction in demand for our theme parks, disruption of the security of our internal systems and products and services or satellite transmission signals, the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our equipment, data, properties and reputation. In addition, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires have impacted our services, products and properties from time to time in the past and will in the future. The occurrence of these events may result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems to protect them from similar events in the future, and any such events could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, we obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third parties, in connection with our business. While we generally obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk that this information may be compromised. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our third-party\u2019s information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, could lead to litigation or could cause regulators in the United States and internationally to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules.\nThe risk of systems-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify in many of our businesses, and our businesses may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these events occurring, due to the nature of our businesses and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. In the ordinary course of our business, there are frequent attempts by third parties to cause such systems-related events and security breaches and to identify our security architecture or system design vulnerabilities. While we develop and maintain systems, and operate an extensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly. Despite our efforts to prevent these events and security breaches, we have experienced systems-related events and breaches in the past, and there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result, and the occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nWe rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses.\nIn addition, NBCUniversal and Sky depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Governance Matters\nWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.\nWhile all of our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, compliance with certain laws and regulations is most material with respect to our Cable Communications and Broadcast Television businesses in the United States. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate.\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statues, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome, and they, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, also have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services, and this trend likely will continue. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality, that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete.\nLegislative and regulatory activity may increase with the change in administration following the 2020 U.S. presidential election. For example, the U.S. Congress may consider proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace, whether it should enact new, permanent Open Internet requirements, and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure or broadband connectivity initiatives. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs. In addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws and United States and foreign policymakers could enact new competition laws or regulatory enforcement options that could negatively impact our businesses. With the change in administration, tax legislation could be enacted increasing the federal corporate income tax from the current rate of 21%. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.\nFailure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the \u201cLegislation and Regulation\u201d discussion within that section.\nUnfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.\nWe are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, free speech, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. Greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.\nLabor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.\nMany of NBCUniversal\u2019s writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Most of NBCUniversal\u2019s collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 28\nIn addition, NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks and broadcast television networks and Sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events, including certain NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB and European football games. Labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.\nOur Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.\u2019s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium.",

We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks; and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. For more information about our company\u2019s operations, see Item 1: Business.

Refer to the \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure\u201d section on page 57 for additional information, including our definition and our use of Adjusted EBITDA, and for a reconciliation from net income attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA.\n2020 Consolidated Operating Results(a)\nRevenue Adjusted EBITDA\n(a)Charts exclude the results of Corporate and Other, and eliminations.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n2020 Developments\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2020:\nOverall\n\u2022COVID-19 materially impacted our 2020 results of operations. While Cable Communications results were strong, NBCUniversal and Sky results experienced material negative impacts due to the temporary closure of our theme parks and the postponement of sporting events, respectively.\n\u2022Repaid $18.8 billion and issued $18.6 billion of long-term debt in 2020 ending the year with $11.7 billion of cash on hand. This financing activity resulted in a reduction in the weighted-average cost of debt due to the favorable interest rate environment and provides additional liquidity given the risks associated with the economic conditions caused by COVID-19.\nCable Communications\n\u2022Revenue increased 3.4% to $60.1 billion, reflecting increases in high-speed internet, wireless, business services and advertising revenue, partially offset by declines in voice, video and other revenue.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.6% to $25.3 billion.\n\u2022Operating margin increased from 40.1% to 42.1%, reflecting increases in revenue from high-speed internet and business services and decreases in losses in our wireless business.\n\u2022Total customer relationships increased by 1.6 million, total high-speed internet customers increased 2.0 million and total video customers decreased 1.4 million.\n\u2022Capital expenditures decreased 4.4% to $6.6 billion, reflecting lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by an increase in spending on scalable infrastructure.\nNBCUniversal\n\u2022Total NBCUniversal revenue decreased 17.3% to $28.1 billion and total NBCUniversal Adjusted EBITDA decreased 28.5% to $6.3 billion driven by the impacts of COVID-19.\n\u2022Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments revenue decreased 5.8% to $10.8 billion and 0.2% to $10.2 billion, respectively, reflecting decreases in advertising revenue, partially offset by increases in content licensing revenue. Distribution revenue decreased at Cable Networks and increased at Broadcast Television.\n\u2022Filmed Entertainment segment revenue decreased 18.7% to $5.3 billion, reflecting lower theatrical and other revenues as a result of theater closures due to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in content licensing revenue.\n\u2022Theme Parks segment revenue decreased 68.9% to $1.8 billion and Adjusted EBITDA decreased from $2.5 billion to a loss of $541 million, reflecting the temporary theme parks closures due to COVID-19.\nSky\n\u2022Sky revenue decreased 3.3% to $18.6 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue decreased 4.2% due to decreases in direct-to-consumer, advertising and content revenues driven by impacts of COVID-19.\n\u2022Sky Adjusted EBITDA decreased 37.0% to $2.0 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky Adjusted EBITDA decreased 37.6% primarily due to the decreases in revenue.\nOther\n\u2022Launched Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service that features NBCUniversal content, which was made available to Comcast customers in April 2020 and launched nationally in July 2020.\n\u2022Corporate and Other revenue increased 9.8% to $366 million primarily due to revenue generated from Peacock.\n\u2022Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA losses increased from $880 million to $2.4 billion primarily due to severance charges and costs associated with Peacock.\nImpacts of COVID-19\nCOVID-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. Our Cable Communications results of operations were strong in 2020, despite having been affected by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions and by the costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as people worked and learned remotely from home. COVID-19 had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations during\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 36\n2020 primarily due to the temporary closure of our theme parks and disruption of professional sports seasons, respectively. We expect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such impact will depend on restrictive governmental measures, further deterioration of the global economy and widespread availability of vaccines.\nCable Communications\n\u2022Our distribution network performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by increased video streaming, gaming and videoconferencing as customers worked and learned remotely from home.\n\u2022We incurred costs in 2020 associated with compensating personnel in roles affected by COVID-19, primarily during the first half of the year. These costs included additional compensation for frontline personnel who worked to keep our customers connected to our services and compensation for certain personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations.\n\u2022Beginning in March 2020 and continuing through June 2021, new qualifying customers for Internet Essentials, our low-income internet adoption program, receive 60 days of free internet services. We also implemented programs, primarily during the second quarter of 2020, under which we elected to waive certain fees and to not disconnect internet, voice or wireless services for customers for nonpayment, and we are providing customers a variety of flexible and extended payment options. As a result of these programs, our customer metrics for 2020 do not include customers in the free Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment. The number of customers excluded from our customer metrics was highest as of June 30, 2020 and these customers were excluded from second quarter net additions. The number of such customers decreased in the third and fourth quarters as some of these customers either began paying for service, resulting in customer net additions, or disconnected and no longer receive service. We expect the number of excluded customers to continue to decrease in future quarters.\n\u2022Certain professional sports leagues were disrupted due to COVID-19, generally resulting in postponed or canceled matches and reduced schedules. Certain of our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks include contractual adjustment provisions if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur. Our programming expenses were reduced as a result of these provisions, and our revenue was negatively impacted in similar amounts as a result of adjustments that we passed through to our customers in 2020 and continue to pass through in the first quarter of 2021.\n\u2022The deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 have resulted in reduced demand for certain of our residential and business services and reduced spending from advertisers, which have had and, while we have seen some improvement over the course of 2020, likely will continue to have, negative impacts on our revenue over the near to medium term. In addition, we believe there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred, and may continue to incur, increases in our bad debt expense.\nNBCUniversal\n\u2022The temporary closure of all of our theme parks had the most significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a consolidated basis. Our parks in Orlando and Japan reopened with limited capacity in June 2020, while our park in Hollywood remains closed. We expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term, and we cannot predict with certainty when the Hollywood park will reopen, if any reopened parks will remain open or the level of attendance at any reopened parks. In addition, although we currently expect that Universal Beijing Resort will open in 2021, we have delayed certain construction projects, including the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando.\n\u2022The deterioration of economic conditions caused by COVID-19 resulted in significant reductions in advertising spend by our customers in the Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments and, while we have seen some improvement over the course of 2020, we expect this trend to continue over the near to medium term. There has also been, and likely will continue to be, an acceleration of subscriber losses at our networks.\n\u2022We incurred costs in 2020 associated with compensating personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations due to COVID-19, primarily during the first half of the year, including at our theme parks and at our production studios.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\u2022The postponement and cancellation of many sporting events and professional sports seasons caused by COVID-19 impacted our results of operations during 2020, since both advertising revenues and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. While professional sports leagues generally resumed and completed their seasons in the second half of 2020, some had reduced numbers of events for the remainder of the interrupted seasons. Certain of our sports programming rights agreements and distribution agreements with multichannel video providers require contractual adjustments if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur. Our distribution revenue was negatively impacted as a result of credits accrued relating to these provisions; and the programming costs that we recognized as the remaining events occurred were also impacted. In addition, there have been, and there may be in the future, delays to the start of the current or upcoming seasons for certain professional sports leagues. When, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur in 2021 will impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition. In addition, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics have been postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n\u2022The creation and availability of our film and television programming in the United States and globally have been disrupted, including from the suspension of studio production operations in the first half of 2020. Our studio production operations have resumed at a limited capacity. Additionally, with the temporary closure of many movie theaters worldwide, we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally. Delays in theatrical releases affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows. We expect results of operations in our Filmed Entertainment segment to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\nSky\n\u2022Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the disruption of professional sports seasons and future periods may be negatively impacted as a result of the reopening plans and the extent of reopening of our commercial customers. While sporting events generally resumed late in the second quarter of 2020 and the interrupted seasons were completed, there were delays to the start of the current seasons for certain sports, including European soccer. As a result, significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs were not recognized in 2020. COVID-19 continues to result in uncertainty in the ultimate timing of when, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur in future periods; their broadcast is expected to impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition.\n\u2022We temporarily suspended certain sales channels due to COVID-19, which negatively impacted net customer additions and revenue in the first half of 2020. Our sales channels generally resumed operations in June 2020.\n\u2022COVID-19 has resulted in the deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty in Europe, intensifying what was an already deteriorating economic and advertising environment. These conditions negatively impacted revenue in 2020 and, while we have seen some improvement over the course of 2020, we expect COVID-19 likely will continue to negatively impact advertising spend and consumer demand for our services in 2021. In addition, there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred and may continue to incur increases in our bad debt expense.\nWe have implemented and will continue to implement cost savings initiatives across our businesses that have impacted and will continue to impact our results of operations; certain costs incurred by our businesses in response to COVID-19, including severance, are presented in Corporate and Other. Our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives, with the most significant relating to severance at NBCUniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base. We do not anticipate significant incremental costs to be incurred under these plans, and payments related to NBCUniversal employee severance are expected to be completed in 2021. NBCUniversal employee-related costs savings will be realized in operating costs and expenses primarily beginning in 2021 and a portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives.\nGlobal financial markets have been volatile and domestic and global economic conditions continue to show signs of material weakness. At this point, it is impossible to predict the extent and duration of these and any other impacts of COVID-19 to our businesses, or the degree to which demand for our products and services, or supply of key inputs to those products and services, will be affected. This uncertainty makes it challenging for management to estimate with precision the future performance of our businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we evaluated whether the facts and circumstances and available information resulted in the need for an impairment assessment for any of our long-lived assets and concluded no assessment was required. Refer to the Critical\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 38\nAccounting Judgments and Estimates section for discussion of our impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights. We will continue to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses, including the impacts of overall economic conditions, which could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the future.\nLiquidity\nAlthough negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19, we expect that our businesses will continue to generate significant cash flows from operating activities and we believe that these cash flows, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing, will be sufficient for us to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements. In 2020, we issued $18.6 billion of long-term debt, the proceeds of which were used to repay existing indebtedness and increase cash on our balance sheet in order to bolster liquidity and strengthen our financial position as a result of the increased uncertainty related to the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also took actions to conservatively manage cash through reductions in costs and capital expenditures in 2020. We expect the timing of certain priorities may continue to be impacted, such as the pace of our debt reduction efforts and returning capital to shareholders, and the delay of certain capital projects.\nCompetition\nAll of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. For additional information on the competition our businesses face, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the \u201cCompetition\u201d discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled \u201cOur businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively\u201d and \u201cChanges in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\u201d\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. See Item 1: Business and refer to the \u201cSeasonality and Cyclicality\u201d discussion within that section for additional information.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nConsolidated Operating Results\nYear ended December 31 (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 2018 % Change\n2019 to 2020 % Change\n2018 to 2019\nRevenue $ 103,564 $ 108,942 $ 94,507 (4.9) % 15.3 %\nCosts and Expenses:\nProgramming and production 33,121 34,440 29,692 (3.8) 16.0\nOther operating and administrative 33,109 32,807 28,094 0.9 16.8\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion 6,741 7,617 7,036 (11.5) 8.2\nDepreciation 8,320 8,663 8,281 (4.0) 4.6\nAmortization 4,780 4,290 2,736 11.4 56.8\nOther operating gains - - (341) - NM\nTotal costs and expenses 86,071 87,817 75,498 (2.0) 16.3\nOperating income 17,493 21,125 19,009 (17.2) 11.1\nInterest expense (4,588) (4,567) (3,542) 0.5 28.9\nInvestment and other income (loss), net 1,160 438 (225) 164.8 294.6\nIncome before income taxes 14,065 16,996 15,242 (17.2) 11.5\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (3,364) (3,673) (3,380) (8.4) 8.7\nNet income 10,701 13,323 11,862 (19.7) 12.3\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock 167 266 131 (37.5) 102.7\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 10,534 $ 13,057 $ 11,731 (19.3) % 11.3 %\nBasic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$ 2.30 $ 2.87 $ 2.56 (19.9) % 12.1 %\nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$ 2.28 $ 2.83 $ 2.53 (19.4) % 11.9 %\nAdjusted EBITDA(a)\n$ 30,826 $ 34,258 $ 30,165 (10.0) % 13.6 %\nAll percentages are calculated based on actual amounts.

Refer to the \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure\u201d section on page 57 for additional information, including our definition and our use of Adjusted EBITDA, and for a reconciliation from net income attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe comparability of our consolidated results of operations was impacted by the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018. Sky\u2019s results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements following the October 9, 2018 acquisition date.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 40\nConsolidated Revenue\nThe following graph illustrates the contributions to the change in consolidated revenue made by our Cable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky segments, as well as by Corporate and Other activities, including eliminations.\nThe primary drivers of the change in revenue from 2019 to 2020 were as follows:\n\u2022A decrease in our NBCUniversal segments revenue primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 resulting in decreased revenue at the Theme Parks, Filmed Entertainment, Cable Networks and Broadcast segments.\n\u2022A decrease in Corporate, Other and Eliminations revenue primarily due to an increase in eliminations as a result of the licensing of content between our NBCUniversal segments and Peacock.\n\u2022A decrease in our Sky segment revenue primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 resulting in decreased direct-to-consumer, advertising and content revenue, as well as the impact of foreign currency translation.\n\u2022Growth in our Cable Communications segment revenue driven by increased revenue from high-speed internet, wireless, business services and advertising, partially offset by decreased revenue from voice, video and other revenue.\nRevenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading \u201cSegment Operating Results.\u201d\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses\nThe following graph illustrates the contributions to the change in consolidated operating costs and expenses, representing total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense, made by our Cable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky segments, as well as by Corporate and Other activities, including eliminations.\nThe primary drivers of the change in operating costs and expenses from 2019 to 2020 were as follows:\n\u2022A decrease in NBCUniversal expenses primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, which led to decreased expenses in our Filmed Entertainment, Theme Parks, Cable Networks and Broadcast segments.\n\u2022Flat Cable Communications segment expenses primarily due to decreased advertising, marketing and promotion expenses and customer service expenses, offset by an increase in programming expenses, other expenses, technical product support costs, and franchise and other regulatory fees.\n\u2022An increase in Corporate, Other and Eliminations expenses primarily due to certain costs incurred in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses, costs associated with Peacock, and a legal settlement, partially offset by an increase in eliminations as a result of our licensing content between our NBCUniversal segments and Peacock.\n\u2022An increase in our Sky segment\u2019s expenses primarily due to an increase in other costs and direct network costs, partially offset by a decrease in programming and production costs and the impacts of foreign currency translation.\nOperating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, business development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading \u201cSegment Operating Results.\u201d\nConsolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 % Change\n2019 to 2020 % Change\n2018 to 2019\nCable Communications $ 7,753 $ 7,994 $ 8,262 (3.0) % (3.2) %\nNBCUniversal 2,278 2,129 2,108 7.0 0.9\nSky 3,034 2,699 539 12.4 NM\nCorporate and Other 35 131 108 (74.1) 21.4\nComcast Consolidated $ 13,100 $ 12,953 $ 11,017 1.1 % 17.6 %\nPercentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.\nNBCUniversal and Sky depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2020 primarily due to amortization of certain trade names beginning in the first quarter of 2020, which were previously accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets (see Note 11). Cable Communications depreciation and amortization expense decreased due to lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by an increase in spending on scalable infrastructure.\nAmortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $2.3 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 42\nConsolidated Interest Expense\nInterest expense was flat in 2020 compared to 2019 as $360 million of charges related to the early redemption of senior notes were offset by lower weighted-average interest rates and a decrease in average debt outstanding.\nConsolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nEquity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ (113) $ (505) $ (364)\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 1,014 656 (187)\nOther income (loss), net 259 287 326\nTotal investment and other income (loss), net $ 1,160 $ 438 $ (225)\nEquity in Net Income (Losses) of Investees, Net\nThe change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to our investment in Atairos Group, Inc. and our reduced share of net losses for other equity method investments. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income of $286 million in 2020 and losses of $64 million in 2019. See Note 9 for additional information related to our investments.\nRealized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities, Net\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2020 were primarily as a result of gains relating to transactions involving FanDuel and PointsBet and a public offering by fuboTV, as well as gains related to our investment in Peloton, which was sold during 2020. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2019 resulted primarily from gains related to our interests in Snap, which was sold in 2019, and Peloton as a result of its initial public offering in 2019. See Note 9 for additional information related to our investments.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nThe change in other income (loss), net in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the recognition of $219 million of gains related to the dilution of our Hulu ownership in 2019, partially offset by foreign currency gains and lower impairments related to equity method investments in 2020.\nConsolidated Income Tax (Expense) Benefit\nOur effective income tax rate in 2020 and 2019 was 23.9% and 21.6%, respectively.\nIn 2020, the effective income tax rate included $145 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes in the third quarter of 2020.\nIn 2019, the effective income tax rate included $125 million of benefits related to state income tax adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2019.\nConsolidated Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock\nThe decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to our acquisition of the remaining interest of one of our noncontrolling interests.\nSegment Operating Results\nOur segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments (see Note 2).\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCable Communications Segment Results of Operations\nRevenue and Adjusted EBITDA\nResidential Customer Relationships\n(in billions) (in millions)\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 % Change\n2019 to 2020 % Change\n2018 to 2019\nRevenue\nResidential:\nHigh-speed internet $ 20,599 $ 18,752 $ 17,144 9.9 % 9.4 %\nVideo 21,937 22,270 22,455 (1.5) (0.8)\nVoice 3,532 3,879 3,960 (8.9) (2.1)\nWireless 1,574 1,167 890 34.9 31.2\nBusiness services 8,191 7,795 7,129 5.1 9.3\nAdvertising 2,594 2,465 2,795 5.2 (11.8)\nOther 1,624 1,754 1,660 (7.5) 5.7\nTotal revenue 60,051 58,082 56,033 3.4 3.7\nOperating costs and expenses\nProgramming 13,498 13,389 13,249 0.8 1.1\nTechnical and product support 8,022 7,973 7,569 0.6 5.3\nCustomer service 2,432 2,494 2,536 (2.5) (1.6)\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion 3,759 4,014 4,002 (6.3) 0.3\nFranchise and other regulatory fees 1,625 1,582 1,578 2.7 0.2\nOther 5,445 5,364 5,418 1.5 (1.0)\nTotal operating costs and expenses 34,781 34,816 34,352 (0.1) 1.4\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 25,270 $ 23,266 $ 21,681 8.6 % 7.3 %\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 44\nCustomer Metrics\nNet Additions\n(in thousands) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018\nCustomer relationships\nResidential customer relationships\n30,718 29,149 28,109 1,569 1,040 925\nBusiness services customer relationships\n2,426 2,396 2,303 30 94 123\nTotal customer relationships 33,144 31,545 30,412 1,599 1,134 1,048\nResidential customer relationships mix\nOne product customers\n12,434 10,247 9,015 2,187 1,232 840\nTwo product customers\n8,734 8,923 8,992 (188) (69) (25)\nThree or more product customers\n9,550 9,979 10,102 (429) (123) 110\nHigh-speed internet\nResidential customers\n28,351 26,414 25,097 1,937 1,317 1,234\nBusiness services customers\n2,248 2,215 2,125 34 89 120\nTotal high-speed internet customers 30,600 28,629 27,222 1,971 1,406 1,353\nVideo\nResidential customers\n18,993 20,288 20,959 (1,295) (671) (344)\nBusiness services customers\n852 966 1,027 (114) (61) (27)\nTotal video customers 19,846 21,254 21,986 (1,408) (733) (370)\nVoice\nResidential customers\n9,645 9,934 10,153 (289) (218) (163)\nBusiness services customers\n1,357 1,342 1,297 15 46 60\nTotal voice customers 11,002 11,276 11,449 (275) (173) (103)\nWireless\nWireless lines 2,826 2,052 1,236 774 816 854\nCustomer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For MDUs, including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our HD or DVR services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential high-speed internet and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. Wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers\u2019 accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics for 2020 do not include certain high-risk customers who continue to receive service following nonpayment or customers in the free Internet Essentials offer (refer to \u201cImpacts of COVID-19\u201d for further discussion).\n2020 2019 2018 % Change 2019 to 2020 % Change 2018 to 2019\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 154.71 $ 156.24 $ 156.23 (1.0) % - %\nAverage monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 65.11 $ 62.59 $ 60.45 4.0 % 3.5 %\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events. For customers receiving bundled services, the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle.\nEach of our services has a different contribution to operating margin and we also use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe these metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCable Communications Segment - Revenue\nWe are a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services, which are marketed individually and as bundled services. We also generate revenue from selling through our allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that is received as part of distribution agreements with these networks to local, regional and national advertisers.\nHigh-Speed Internet\nWe offer high-speed internet services with downstream speeds that range up to 1.2 Gbps and fiber-based speeds that range up to 2 Gbps. We also deploy xFi-enabled wireless gateways that deliver internet and voice connectivity, whole-home Wi-Fi coverage, network control and advanced security features. We believe our customer base will continue to grow as consumers choose our high-speed internet service and seek higher-speed offerings.\nRevenue increased in 2020 primarily due to an increase in the number of residential high-speed internet customers. The remaining increase in revenue in 2020 was due to an increase in average rates. Average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by waived fees due to COVID-19 and the impacts of customer adjustments. Refer to video description below for further information.\nVideo\nWe offer a broad variety of video services packages that may include premium networks, pay-per-view services and our On Demand service. Our video customers may also subscribe for additional fees to our HD and DVR services.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential video customers, partially offset by an increase in average rates. Average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events. For customers receiving bundled services, the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle.\nWe have experienced, and expect that we will continue to experience, declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures, and we expect that our video revenue will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs, such as promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments.\nVoice\nWe offer voice services that provide local and long-distance calling and other related features.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in average rates and a decline in the number of residential voice customers.\nWe expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline.\nWireless\nWe offer wireless phone services to customers that may choose to pay for services on an unlimited data plan, shared data plans, or per gigabyte of data used.\nRevenue increased in 2020 primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines.\nBusiness Services\nWe offer a variety of products and services to businesses. Our service offerings for small business locations primarily include high-speed internet services, as well as voice and video services, that are similar to those provided to residential customers, and include certain other features specific to businesses. We also offer Ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and other services to meet the needs of medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators.\nRevenue increased in 2020 primarily due to increases in average rates and an increase in the number of customers receiving our services. The rates of growth were reduced due to the negative impacts of COVID-19 on small businesses.\nAdvertising\nAs part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that is sold through our advertising business to local, regional and national advertisers. We also represent the advertising sales\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 46\nefforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our digital platforms. We also provide technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry, which allow advertisers to more effectively engage with their target audiences. Revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market, general economic conditions, and cyclicality related to political campaigns and issue-oriented advertising.\nRevenue increased in 2020 primarily due to an increase in political advertising, partially offset by a reduction in spending from advertisers due to COVID-19.\nIn 2020, 4% of our advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments, compared to 5% and 4% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above.\nOther\nOther revenue primarily includes revenue related to our security and automation services. We also receive revenue related to residential customer late fees and from services, such as the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 primarily due to certain waived billing and collection fees due to COVID-19, partially offset by higher revenue from the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\nCable Communications Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming Expenses\nProgramming expenses, which represent our most significant operating expense, are the fees we incur to provide content to our customers. These expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by content providers, the fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations, the number of customers we serve and the amount of content we provide.\nExpenses increased slightly in 2020 primarily due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming fees, partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers. The increase in expenses was also offset by the impact of adjustment provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events as a result of COVID-19.\nWe anticipate that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases to a greater extent in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the timing of contract renewals, partially offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers.\nTechnical and Product Support Expenses\nExpenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities, as well as costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning, as well as the cost of wireless handsets and tablets sold to customers and monthly wholesale wireless access fees.\nExpenses were flat in 2020 primarily due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service and increased costs related to COVID-19, including additional compensation costs for certain personnel, offset by cost savings initiatives implemented during the current year, as well as a reduction in activity in certain aspects of our business.\nCustomer Service Expenses\nExpenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity.\nExpenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes and cost savings initiatives implemented during the current year, partially offset by an increase in costs as a result of additional Xfinity stores.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses include the costs associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings.\nExpenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in spending.\nFranchise and Other Regulatory Fees\nFranchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities under the terms of our cable franchise agreements.\nFranchise and other regulatory fees increased in 2020 primarily due to increases in the related rates of these fees.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOther Expenses\nExpenses primarily include personnel costs, advertising expenses, and building and facilities costs.\nOther operating costs and expenses increased in 2020 primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense as a result of COVID-19.\nCable Communications Segment - Operating Margin\nOur operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services, and on reducing losses related to our wireless phone service and improving overall operating cost management. The most significant operating costs and expenses are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which were flat in 2020.\nOur operating margin was 42.1%, 40.1% and 38.7% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. While accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, they resulted in an increase to operating margins. Losses from our wireless phone service were $206 million, $401 million and $743 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNBCUniversal Segments Overview\n2020 NBCUniversal Segments Operating Results(a)\nRevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(in billions) (in billions)\n(a)Segment details in the charts exclude the results of NBCUniversal Headquarters, Other and Eliminations and therefore the amounts do not equal the total.

The decrease was also due to credits accrued at some of our regional sports networks resulting from the reduced number of games played by professional sports leagues due to COVID-19. Certain of our distribution agreements with multichannel video providers require contractual adjustments if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur.\nAdvertising\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising units sold on our cable networks and digital properties. Advertising revenue is primarily based on the price we charge for each advertising unit, which is generally based on audience ratings, the value of our viewer demographics to advertisers and the number of advertising units we can place in our cable networks\u2019 programming schedules. Advertising revenue is affected by the audience ratings of our programming, the strength of the national advertising market and general economic conditions.\nAdvertising revenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to continued audience ratings declines at our networks and reduced spending from advertisers as a result of COVID-19, including as a result of the reduced number of sporting events, partially offset by higher prices for advertising units sold.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nContent Licensing and Other\nRevenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our owned programming in the United States and internationally to cable and broadcast networks and to DTC streaming service providers, as well as from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services such as iTunes. In addition, our cable television studio production operations generate revenue from programming the studio produces for third-party networks and for DTC streaming service providers.\nRevenue increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to revenue from our digital properties, partially offset by the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements.\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, 15%, 15% and 14%, respectively, of our Cable Networks segment revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. These amounts are eliminated in Comcast\u2019s consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above.\nCable Networks Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nCosts include the amortization of owned and acquired programming, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, costs associated with the distribution of our programming to third-party networks and other distribution platforms, and on-air talent costs.\nCosts decreased in 2020 primarily due to decreases in sports programming costs recognized resulting from the reduced number of events as a result of COVID-19.\nOther Operating and Administrative Expenses\nOther operating and administrative costs and expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses.\nExpenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower employee-related costs as a result of cost savings initiatives.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses consist primarily of the costs associated with promoting programming on our cable networks and digital properties.\nExpenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower spending on marketing related to our cable networks.\nBroadcast Television Segment Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 % Change\n2019 to 2020 % Change\n2018 to 2019\nRevenue\nAdvertising $ 5,027 $ 5,712 $ 7,010 (12.0) % (18.5) %\nContent licensing 2,640 2,157 2,182 22.4 (1.1)\nDistribution and other 2,577 2,392 2,247 7.8 6.4\nTotal revenue 10,244 10,261 11,439 (0.2) (10.3)\nOperating costs and expenses\nProgramming and production 6,548 6,547 7,789 - (15.9)\nOther operating and administrative 1,476 1,564 1,547 (5.6) 1.1\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion 286 420 446 (31.9) (5.9)\nTotal operating costs and expenses 8,310 8,531 9,782 (2.6) (12.8)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,934 $ 1,730 $ 1,657 11.8 % 4.4 %\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 50\nBroadcast Television Segment - Revenue\nAdvertising\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising units sold on our broadcast networks, owned local broadcast television stations and digital properties. Advertising revenue is primarily based on the price we charge for each advertising unit, which is generally based on audience ratings and the value of our viewer demographics to advertisers, and the number of advertising units we can place in our broadcast networks\u2019 and owned local television stations\u2019 programming schedules. Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the national and local advertising markets, general economic conditions, cyclicality related to political campaigns and issue-oriented advertising, and the success and ratings of our programming.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to continued declines in audience ratings and reduced spending from advertisers as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by higher prices for advertising units sold.\nContent Licensing\nRevenue is generated from the licensing of our owned programming in the United States and internationally to various distribution platforms, including to cable and broadcast networks, and to DTC streaming service providers. In addition, our broadcast television studio production operations develop and produce original content that they license to broadcast networks, cable networks and local broadcast television stations owned by us and third parties, as well as to DTC streaming service providers. The production and distribution costs related to our owned programming generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial network license, which means the subsequent licensing of our owned programming series following the initial network license is critical to their financial success.\nContent licensing revenue increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the timing of content provided under our licensing agreement, including transactions with Peacock beginning in the second quarter of 2020.\nDistribution and Other\nWe generate distribution and other revenue primarily from fees for retransmission consent of our owned local broadcast television stations and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated local broadcast television stations, as well as from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services. The sale of our owned programming is driven primarily by the popularity of our broadcast networks and programming series and therefore fluctuates based on consumer spending and acceptance. Distribution and other revenue also includes distribution revenue associated with our periodic broadcasts of the Olympic Games.\nRevenue increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to increases in fees recognized under our retransmission consent agreements.\nBroadcast Television Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nExpenses relate to content that originates on our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, as well as owned content that is licensed to third parties. These costs include the amortization of owned and acquired programming costs, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, costs associated with the distribution of our programming to third-party networks and other distribution platforms, and on-air talent costs.\nExpenses were flat in 2020 primarily due to lower production costs as a result of delays in production and airing of new programs and cost savings initiatives and the impact of the updated accounting guidance, which removed certain limitations on the amounts capitalized for episodic television series and had a favorable impact on programming and production expense in the current year (see Note 8), which were offset by higher amortization associated with content licensing sales.\nOther Operating and Administrative Expenses\nOther operating and administrative costs and expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses. Expenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to decreased overhead costs as part of cost savings initiatives and lower employee-related costs.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses consist primarily of the costs associated with promoting our owned and acquired television programming, as well as the marketing of DVDs and costs associated with our digital properties. These expenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower spending on marketing related to our programming.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nFilmed Entertainment Segment Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 % Change\n2019 to 2020 % Change\n2018 to 2019\nRevenue\nTheatrical $ 421 $ 1,469 $ 2,111 (71.4) % (30.4) %\nContent licensing 3,342 3,045 2,899 9.7 5.1\nHome entertainment 944 957 1,048 (1.4) (8.7)\nOther 569 1,022 1,094 (44.2) (6.7)\nTotal revenue 5,276 6,493 7,152 (18.7) (9.2)\nOperating costs and expenses\nProgramming and production 2,603 2,949 3,446 (11.7) (14.4)\nOther operating and administrative 988 1,131 1,189 (12.6) (4.9)\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion 900 1,580 1,783 (43.0) (11.4)\nTotal operating costs and expenses 4,491 5,660 6,418 (20.6) (11.8)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 785 $ 833 $ 734 (5.8) % 13.5 %\nFilmed Entertainment Segment - Revenue\nTheatrical\nRevenue is generated from the worldwide theatrical release of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters and is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute, as well as their acceptance by audiences. Theatrical revenue is also affected by the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is generally a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding distribution platforms.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 primarily due to theater closures as a result of COVID-19.\nContent Licensing\nRevenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our produced and acquired films to cable, broadcast and premium networks, DTC streaming service providers and through video on demand and pay-per-view services provided by multichannel video providers and OTT service providers, including through the release of certain titles made available for viewing on video on demand platforms following a shortened theatrical release window.\nRevenue increased in 2020 primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements, including transactions with Peacock beginning in the second quarter of 2020, and increased sales of titles made available on demand, including certain 2020 releases after theater closures due to COVID-19.\nHome Entertainment\nRevenue is generated from the sale of our produced and acquired films on DVDs to retail stores and rental kiosks, and through digital distribution services. Revenue is significantly affected by the timing and number of our releases and their acceptance by consumers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of the exhibition of a film in movie theaters, holiday periods and the timing of competitive releases. The overall DVD market continues to experience declines due to the maturation of the DVD format from increasing shifts in consumer behavior toward digital distribution services and subscription rental services, both of which generate less revenue per transaction than DVD sales, as well as due to piracy.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 primarily due to higher sales of 2019 releases in the prior year period including How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw and Dr. Seuss\u2019 The Grinch, partially offset by sales of 2020 releases, including Trolls World Tour, 1917 and Dolittle, in the current year period.\nOther\nRevenue is generated from Fandango, our movie ticketing and entertainment business, consumer products, the production and licensing of live stage plays, and the distribution of filmed entertainment produced by third parties.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 primarily due to decreases in revenue from our movie ticketing and entertainment business and live stage plays, which were impacted by theater and entertainment venue closures as a result of COVID-19.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 52\nFilmed Entertainment Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nExpenses include the amortization of capitalized film production and acquisition costs, residual and participation payments, and distribution expenses. Residual payments represent amounts payable to individuals hired under collective bargaining agreements to work on productions and are calculated based on post-theatrical revenue. Participation payments are primarily based on film performance and represent contingent consideration payable to creative talent, to third parties that have entered into cofinancing agreements with us and to other parties involved in the production of a film. The costs associated with producing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future.\nExpenses decreased in 2020 due to higher amortization of film production costs in the prior year period.\nOther Operating and Administrative Expenses\nExpenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses.\nExpenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower costs associated with our movie ticketing and entertainment business and live stage plays, which were impacted by theater and entertainment venue closures as a result of COVID-19.\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses consist primarily of expenses associated with advertising for our theatrical releases and the marketing of our films on DVDs and in digital formats. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters. As a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film\u2019s exhibition in movie theaters and may not realize profits, if any, until the film generates home entertainment and content licensing revenue. The costs associated with marketing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future.\nExpenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower spending on current period releases as a result of COVID-19.\nTheme Parks Segment Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 % Change\n2019 to 2020 % Change\n2018 to 2019\nRevenue $ 1,846 $ 5,933 $ 5,683 (68.9) % 4.4 %\nOperating costs and expenses 2,387 3,478 3,228 (31.4) 7.7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ (541) $ 2,455 $ 2,455 (122.0) % - %\nTheme Parks Segment - Revenue\nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at Universal theme parks. Guest spending includes ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise. Guest spending depends heavily on the general environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on travel and other recreational activities.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 due to the temporary closures of our theme parks as a result of COVID-19, beginning in late February in Japan and mid-March for our theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood. Our theme parks in Orlando and Japan reopened with limited capacity in June, while our park in Hollywood remains closed.\nTheme Parks Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nExpenses consist primarily of theme park operations, including repairs and maintenance and related administrative expenses; food, beverage and merchandise costs; labor costs; and sales and marketing costs.\nExpenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to decreases in costs related to park operations due to the park closures and lower marketing-related costs, partially offset by pre-opening costs associated with Universal Beijing Resort. We expect to incur significant additional pre-opening costs ahead of the expected opening of Universal Beijing Resort in 2021.\nNBCUniversal Headquarters, Other and Eliminations\nExpenses include overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives. Expenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower employee-related costs and decreased overhead costs as part of cost savings initiatives.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nSky Segment Results of Operations\nSky\u2019s results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements following the October 9, 2018 acquisition date, impacting the comparability of results of operations from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019, and as a result, actual growth rates for those fiscal years are not meaningful.\nThe discussion below compares Sky\u2019s actual results for 2020 to actual results for 2019. The pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the Sky transaction occurred on January 1, 2017. Pro forma data is also adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting and eliminating the costs and expenses directly related to the transaction, but does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined business.

Commercial customers include hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants with an active subscription for the purpose of providing Sky services to customers. Sky reports commercial customers based on the number of commercial agreements per venue in the United Kingdom, and generally based on a residential equivalent unit using the multiple of residential customer revenue in Italy and the number of active venues (bars and restaurants) or rooms (hotels and clinics) in Germany.\n2020 2019 2018 % Change 2019 to 2020 % Change 2018 to 2019\nActual Actual Pro Forma Actual Constant\nCurrency\nGrowth(a)\nPro Forma\nGrowth Constant\nCurrency\nGrowth(a)\nAverage monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship $ 52.93 $ 54.41 $ 57.67 (2.7) % (3.7) % (5.7) % (1.0) %\n(a)Constant currency growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Each of Sky\u2019s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe this metric is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to-consumer service offerings.\nSky Segment - Revenue\nDirect-to-Consumer\nRevenue is derived from subscription and transactional revenue from residential and business customers. Subscription revenue includes revenue from residential and business subscribers to video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, including DTC streaming service subscriptions and income from set-top boxes, wireless phone handset and tablet sales, installation, service calls and warranties. Transactional revenue includes the purchase of physical and digital content, DTC streaming daily passes, and pay-per-view programming.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in average revenue per customer relationship as a result of COVID-19.\nContent\nRevenue is derived from the distribution of Sky\u2019s owned television channels on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and acquired programming to third-party video providers.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in revenue from the distribution of Sky\u2019s sports programming on third-party platforms due to postponed sporting events as a result of COVID-19.\nAdvertising\nRevenue is derived from the sale of advertising and sponsorships across Sky\u2019s owned television channels and where it represents the sales efforts of third-party channels.\nRevenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to overall market weakness, which has worsened due to COVID-19, and the impact of changes in legislation related to gambling advertisements in the United Kingdom and Italy that occurred in the third quarter of 2019.\nSky Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and Production Costs\nExpenses primarily relate to content broadcast on Sky\u2019s channels. These costs include the amortization of owned and acquired programming costs, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, and on-air talent costs. These expenses also include the fees associated with programming distribution agreements for channels owned by third parties, which are generally based on the number of customers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided.\nExpenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses decreased primarily due to the impacts of the disruptions of professional sports seasons as a result of COVID-19, including the delayed starts of the current European soccer seasons.\nDirect Network Costs\nExpenses primarily include costs directly related to the supply of high-speed internet and voice services, including wireless phone services, to Sky\u2019s customers. This includes call costs, monthly wholesale access fees and other variable costs associated with Sky\u2019s network. In addition, it includes the cost of mobile handsets sold to customers.\nExpenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to an increase in costs associated with Sky\u2019s high-speed internet and wireless phone services as a result of increases in the number of customers receiving these services.\nOther Expenses\nExpenses include costs related to marketing, fees paid to third-party channels where Sky represents the advertising sales efforts, subscriber management, supply chain, transmission, technology, fixed networks and general administrative costs.\nExpenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to higher marketing costs related to Sky Q and the launch of FTTH services in Italy and a favorable settlement in the prior year, partially offset by lower fees paid to third-party channels for advertising sales efforts resulting from the impact of COVID-19.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCorporate, Other and Eliminations\nCorporate and Other Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 % Change\n2019 to 2020 % Change\n2018 to 2019\nRevenue $ 366 $ 333 $ 513 9.8 % (35.0) %\nOperating costs and expenses 3,046 1,393 1,772 118.5 (21.3)\nAdjustment for legal settlement (177) - (125) NM NM\nAdjustment for Sky transaction-related costs (56) (180) (355) NM NM\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,447) $ (880) $ (779) (178.0) % (12.9) %\nPercentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.\nCorporate and Other - Revenue\nRevenue primarily relates to Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and revenue at Peacock beginning in the second quarter of 2020.\nRevenue increased in 2020 primarily due to revenue generated from Peacock. The increases were partially offset by decreases at Comcast Spectacor as a result of COVID-19.\nCorporate and Other - Operating Costs and Expenses\nExpenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the costs of other business initiatives, such as Peacock, and operating costs and expenses associated with Comcast Spectacor.\nExpenses increased in 2020 primarily due to costs associated with Peacock, certain costs incurred in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses, a legal settlement and other non-recurring items, which were partially offset by a reduction in costs related to the Sky transaction, including expenses resulting from the replacement of share-based compensation awards and costs related to integration activities. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, Peacock costs include amortization of film and television costs and we expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing for the new platform.

Refer to Note 2 for further description of transactions between our segments.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 56\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance.\nWe reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation\n$ 10,534 $ 13,057 $ 11,731\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock\n167 266 131\nIncome tax (benefit) expense 3,364 3,673 3,380\nInvestment and other (income) loss, net (1,160) (438) 225\nInterest expense 4,588 4,567 3,542\nDepreciation 8,320 8,663 8,281\nAmortization 4,780 4,290 2,736\nOther operating gains - - (341)\nAdjustment for Sky transaction-related costs 56 180 355\nAdjustment for legal settlement 177 - 125\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 30,826 $ 34,258 $ 30,165\nConstant Currency\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance.\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nReconciliation of Sky Constant Currency Growth Rates\n2020 2019 % Change 2019 to 2020 2019 2018 % Change 2018 to 2019\nYear ended December 31 (in millions, except per customer data) Actual Constant\nCurrency Constant Currency Growth Actual Constant\nCurrency Constant Currency Growth\nRevenue\nDirect-to-consumer $ 15,223 $ 15,698 (3.0) % $ 15,538 $ 15,326 1.4 %\nContent 1,373 1,443 (4.9) 1,432 1,196 19.7\nAdvertising 1,998 2,270 (12.0) 2,249 2,376 (5.4)\nTotal revenue 18,594 19,411 (4.2) 19,219 18,898 1.7\nOperating costs and expenses\nProgramming and production 8,649 8,967 (3.5) 8,865 8,406 5.4\nDirect network costs 2,086 1,759 18.6 1,746 1,555 12.3\nOther 5,905 5,556 6.3 5,509 6,173 (10.8)\nTotal operating costs and expenses 16,640 16,282 2.2 16,120 16,134 (0.1)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,954 $ 3,129 (37.6) % 3,099 $ 2,764 12.2 %\nAverage monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship $ 52.93 $ 54.97 (3.7) % $ 54.41 $ 54.98 (1.0) %\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures, investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Refer to \u201cImpacts of COVID-19\u201d for additional discussion.\nWe maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper programs provide a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. See Note 6 for additional information on our revolving credit facilities. As of December 31, 2020, amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion.\nComcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing the Comcast revolving credit facility. The financial covenant in the credit facility pertains to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility. We test for compliance with this financial covenant on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2020, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin. We do not expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant. In addition, the Universal Studios Japan term loans contain certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2020, Universal Studios Japan was in compliance with all of these covenants.\nOperating Activities\nComponents of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nOperating income $ 17,493 $ 21,125 $ 19,009\nDepreciation, amortization and other operating gains 13,100 12,953 10,676\nNoncash share-based compensation 1,193 1,021 826\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities (178) (2,335) (1,313)\nPayments of interest (3,878) (4,254) (2,897)\nPayments of income taxes (3,183) (3,231) (2,355)\nProceeds from investments and other 190 418 351\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 24,737 $ 25,697 $ 24,297\nThe variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, including the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, which resulted from the\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 58\nsuspension of studio production operations partially offset by the timing of sporting events, as well as the extension of due dates for certain tax payments and accruals related to severance.\nThe decrease in interest payments in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding.\nThe decrease in income tax payments in 2020 was primarily due to lower taxable income from operations in 2020, partially offset by the taxable gain associated with the AirTouch redemption which approximated the proceeds received.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets, the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, purchases of investments and the purchase of spectrum rights, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. Net cash used in investing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets, purchases of investments and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures decreased in 2020 primarily due to decreases in spending by our Theme Parks segment as a result of COVID-19 and by our Cable Communications segment, partially offset by increases in spending by our Sky segment, reflecting the continued deployment of Sky Q and high-speed internet services.\nOur most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our Cable Communications segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. Cable Communications\u2019 capital expenditures decreased primarily due to lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by an increase in spending on scalable infrastructure. The table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our Cable Communications segment in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nCustomer premise equipment $ 2,333 $ 2,659 $ 2,917\nScalable infrastructure 2,289 2,000 2,555\nLine extensions 1,394 1,392 1,484\nSupport capital 589 858 767\nTotal $ 6,605 $ 6,909 $ 7,723\nWe expect our capital expenditures for 2021 will be focused on the continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our Cable Communications segment; increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential; and the continued deployment of wireless gateways, our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology, Sky Q, and international DTC streaming platforms. In addition, while we expect to invest in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks in the future, we have paused the construction of our additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including acquisitions, competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, and the timing of new attractions at our theme parks.\nCash Paid for Intangible Assets\nIn 2020, cash paid for intangible assets was flat primarily due to decreases in expenditures for software development at our Cable Communications segment, offset by increases in expenditures for software development at both our Sky segment and at Corporate, primarily related to our development of Sky Q and Peacock, respectively.\nConstruction of Universal Beijing Resort\nConstruction of Universal Beijing Resort includes costs related to the construction of the Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China. See Note 7.\nPurchase of Spectrum\nOn September 2, 2020, the FCC announced the results of its CBRS spectrum auction. In connection with the auction, we acquired the rights to $459 million of spectrum.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nProceeds from Sales of Businesses and Investments\nIn 2020, proceeds from sales of businesses and investments increased primarily due to $1.7 billion of proceeds received from the sale of our investment in AirTouch in the second quarter of 2020. See Note 9.\nPurchases of Investments\nPurchases of investments in 2020 were primarily related to capital contributions to Atairos and in 2019 were primarily related to Hulu, including the acquisition of our proportionate share of the interest previously held by AT&T, and Atairos.\nOther\nOther investing activities in 2020 and 2019 were primarily related to distributions received from equity method investments.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities, dividend payments and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented in other financing activities (see Note 9), which were partially offset by proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the settlement of cross currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and dividend payments, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of senior notes and a collateralized obligation.\nIn 2020, we made debt repayments of $18.8 billion, including the early redemption and purchase of senior notes maturing between 2020 and 2047 and optional repayments of term loans due 2021 to 2023 totaling $15.8 billion.\nIn 2020, we issued $12.5 billion of fixed-rate senior notes maturing between 2025 and 2062, $3.2 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed-rate Euro senior notes maturing between 2027 and 2040 and $1.8 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed-rate Sterling senior notes maturing between 2029 and 2036. In 2020, we made borrowings of $1.1 billion under the Universal Beijing Resort term loan.\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Note 6 for additional information on our financing activities.\nDividends\nOur Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.3 billion in 2020. We paid dividends of $4.1 billion in 2020. In January 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in our dividend to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nThe chart below summarizes our dividends paid in 2020, 2019 and 2018. In addition, we paid $534 million and $504 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.\nDividends Paid\n(in billions)\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 60\nGuarantee Structure\nOur debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.\nDebt and Guarantee Structure\nDecember 31 (in billions) 2020 2019\nDebt subject to cross-guarantees\nComcast $ 85.7 $ 80.4\nNBCUniversal(a)\n2.8 5.8\nComcast Cable(a)\n2.1 2.1\n90.6 88.3\nDebt subject to one-way guarantees\nSky 8.4 9.2\nOther(a)\n2.8 4.1\n11.2 13.3\nDebt not guaranteed\nUniversal Beijing Resort(b)\n2.5 1.3\nOther 1.1 1.0\n3.6 2.3\nDebt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net\n(1.6) (1.7)\nTotal debt $ 103.8 $ 102.2\n(a)NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations.\n(b)Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 7 for additional information.\nCross-guarantees\nComcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the \u201cGuarantors\u201d) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other\u2019s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor\u2019s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor\u2019s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast\u2019s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable\u2019s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets.\nThe Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $124 billion and $122 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $26 billion and $21 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOne-way Guarantees\nComcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC.\nComcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast\u2019s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast\u2019s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis; and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast\u2019s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $94 billion and $92 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $23 billion and $18 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 62\nContractual Obligations\nPayment Due by Period\nAs of December 31, 2020 (in millions) Total Year 1 Years 2-3 Years 4-5 More than 5\nDebt obligations(a)\n$ 104,408 $ 2,923 $ 7,794 $ 13,612 $ 80,079\nCollateralized obligation(a)(b)\n5,168 - - 5,168 -\nFinance lease obligations 1,001 210 159 87 545\nOperating lease obligations 5,381 873 1,461 1,004 2,043\nPurchase obligations(c)\n64,765 21,288 17,254 9,693 16,530\nOther long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet(d)\n5,234 434 1,278 1,218 2,304\nTotal(e)(f)\n$ 185,957 $ 25,728 $ 27,946 $ 30,782 $ 101,501\nRefer to Notes 6 and 16.\n(a)Excludes interest payments.\n(b)Collateralized obligation relates to a $5.2 billion term loan facility, the principal amount of which is fully secured by the minimum guaranteed proceeds under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. See Note 9.\n(c)Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. Our purchase obligations related to Cable Communications and Sky include programming contracts with cable networks and local broadcast television stations; contracts with customer premise equipment manufacturers; contracts with communications vendors and multichannel video providers for which we provide advertising sales representation; contracts to acquire handsets and other equipment; and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. Cable Communications\u2019 and Sky\u2019s programming contracts include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts, which we expect to be significantly higher because these contracts are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming. Our purchase obligations related to NBCUniversal and Sky include commitments to acquire film and television programming, and broadcast rights relating to sporting events, such as the Olympics, the NFL and European soccer leagues, as well as obligations under various creative talent agreements, including obligations to actors, producers and television personalities, and various other television commitments. Purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments.\n(d)Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of deferred compensation obligations and postretirement, pension and postemployment benefit obligations. Our total recorded liability of $2.8 billion related to participations and residuals are not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which these obligations will be settled. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion and the associated interest and penalties are not included in the table above because it is uncertain if or when these amounts will become payable. A contractual obligation with a carrying value of $1.1 billion is not included in the table above because it is uncertain if the arrangement will be settled. The contractual obligation involves an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks. See Note 16 for additional information related to this arrangement.\n(e)Our contractual obligations do not include our capital commitment related to our investment in Atairos due to our inability to estimate the timing of this funding. As of December 31, 2020, our remaining commitment is $1.3 billion based on the capital calls received as of that date (see Note 9).\n(f)Total contractual obligations are made up of the following components.\n(in millions)\nLiabilities recorded on the balance sheet $ 126,230\nCommitments not recorded on the balance sheet 59,727\nTotal $ 185,957\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 8 for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements, including the impact of the adoption of the updated accounting guidance related to film and television costs and credit losses.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCritical Accounting Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. See also Notes 4 and 11.\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Goodwill and Cable Franchise Rights\nWe assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually as of July 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. When analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.\nWe performed qualitative assessments in 2020 for goodwill in our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments. The qualitative assessments considered that the estimated fair values of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values at the time of our previous quantitative assessments in 2018; changes in projected future cash flows; recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of COVID-19; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. Based on these assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required. We performed a quantitative assessment in 2020 for goodwill in our Sky segment and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was higher than the carrying value. Assets and liabilities resulting from a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced as the value of the businesses in a reporting unit increases and as the carrying value of the reporting unit decreases due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired long-lived assets over time. Given the goodwill in our Sky segment resulted from our recent acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the Sky reporting unit.\nChanges in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.\nCable Franchise Rights\nOur cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. The amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. Typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. Often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. We currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the United States.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 64\nWe have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights.\nFor purposes of impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three Cable Communications divisions or units of account. We evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.\nIn 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. At the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2018, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights substantially exceeded their carrying values. We also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment, including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our Cable Communications segment; recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of COVID-19; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.\nChanges in market conditions, laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.\nFilm and Television Content\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. We have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residual payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue.\nOur estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film\u2019s initial release. These estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film\u2019s theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. Upon a film\u2019s release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.\nWith respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window. Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. Once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms, such as U.S. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. Revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast. We recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. Our estimates of ultimate revenue for sports rights include estimates of advertising and subscribers receiving or viewing the broadcasts over the term of the agreements.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nCapitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When performing an impairment assessment, we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts. Adjustments to capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe maintain a mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. In order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt, we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policy.\nWe monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analyses. We do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions.\nOur interest rate derivative financial instruments, which primarily include cross currency swaps, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program. These cross-currency swaps effectively change our current fixed interest rates to different fixed interest rates.\nThe effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments to our consolidated interest expense was a decrease of $9 million in 2020, a decrease of $49 million in 2019, and an increase of $2 million in 2018. Interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on consolidated interest expense in the future.\nThe table below summarizes by contractual year of maturity the principal amount of our debt, effective rates, and fair values subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2020.\n(in millions) 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Estimated\nFair Value as of\nDecember 31, 2020\nDebt\nFixed-rate debt $ 2,045 $ 2,084 $ 1,095 $ 6,246 $ 6,953 $ 78,122 $ 96,545 $ 116,732\nAverage interest rate 1.6 % 6.7 % 2.0 % 3.1 % 3.4 % 3.9 % 3.8 %\nVariable-rate debt $ 1,088 $ 1,944 $ 2,830 $ 500 $ - $ 2,502 $ 8,864 $ 8,873\nAverage interest rate 0.7 % 0.8 % 1.1 % 1.5 % - % 4.4 % 1.9 %\nThe average interest rates on our debt in the table above reflect the effects of our derivative financial instruments. We estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on December 31, 2020, plus the applicable borrowing margin.\nAdditionally, we have a $5.2 billion variable rate term loan presented separately as a collateralized obligation that will mature in March 2024. We entered into a series of variable-to-fixed rate interest rate swaps on $5.2 billion of this term loan with average pay rate and average receive rate related to these interest rate swaps of 1.12% and 0.15% as of December 31, 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the estimated fair value of the term loan was $5.2 billion for each period, and the estimated fair value of the related interest rate swaps was a net liability of $155 million and a net asset of $34 million, respectively.\nSee Notes 1, 6 and 9 for additional information.\nForeign Exchange Risk Management\nWe have significant operations in a number of countries outside the United States through Sky and NBCUniversal, and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. These changes could adversely affect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of our non-U.S. dollar operations, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 66\nAs part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposure for transactions denominated in other than the functional currency. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as currency exchange rates fluctuate to protect the functional currency equivalent value of non-functional currency denominated assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted non-functional currency revenue and expenses. In accordance with our policy, we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed 30 months. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had foreign exchange contracts on transactions other than debt with a total notional value of $8.1 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate estimated fair value of these foreign exchange contracts was not material.\nWe use cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. Cross-currency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency, which hedge currency exchange risks associated with foreign currency denominated cash flows such as interest and principal debt repayments. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges on $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion of our foreign currency denominated debt, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate estimated fair values of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges were a net liability of $45 million and a net asset of $373 million, respectively.\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations. We have foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries. Transaction gains and losses resulting from currency movements on debt and changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are recorded within the currency translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using foreign currency denominated debt was $10.3 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively, and the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using cross-currency swaps was $4.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate estimated fair value of these cross-currency swaps was a net liability of $376 million and $373 million, respectively. The amount of pre-tax gains (losses) related to net investment hedges recognized in the cumulative translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income (loss) were losses of $686 million in 2020, gains of $343 million in 2019 and losses of $3 million in 2018.\nWe have analyzed our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign operations as of December 31, 2020, including our hedging contracts, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. For those assets and liabilities, we then evaluated the effect of a hypothetical 10% shift in currency exchange rates, inclusive of the effects of derivatives. The results of our analysis indicate that such a shift in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our 2020 net income attributable to Comcast Corporation.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. We have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions. These provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold. The threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparty\u2019s credit ratings. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were not required to post collateral under the terms of these agreements, nor did we hold any collateral under the terms of these agreements.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets.\n\u2022Provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors.\n\u2022Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nAudit Committee Oversight\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has oversight responsibility for our financial reporting process and the audits of the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets regularly with management and with our internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm (collectively, the \u201cauditors\u201d) to review matters related to the quality and integrity of our financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting (including compliance matters related to our Code of Conduct), and the nature, extent, and results of internal and external audits.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSky Goodwill - Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company\u2019s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of the Sky reporting unit to its carrying value.\nThe Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of expected cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 70\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\neither the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The goodwill balance was $70,669 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $29,950 million was allocated to the Sky reporting unit. Given the Company\u2019s acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, the fair value of the Sky reporting unit remains in close proximity to its carrying value as of the measurement date.\nWe identified goodwill for Sky as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Sky reporting unit. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows for the Sky reporting unit.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows used by management to estimate the fair value of Sky included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of Sky, such as controls related to management\u2019s selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows.\n\u2022With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n\u2022We evaluated management\u2019s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and cash flows by comparing actual results to (1) historical results, including management\u2019s forecasting accuracy, (2) projections utilized in the purchase price allocation in connection with the 2018 acquisition of Sky, (3) internal communications to management, and (4) forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer group.\nFilm and Television Costs - Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company amortizes capitalized film and television production costs that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes such costs using the ratio of current period revenue to the total remaining revenue forecasted to be realized, also known as \u201cultimate revenue.\u201d In addition, the Company recognizes the costs of multiyear, live-event sports programming rights as the rights are utilized over the contractual term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. The estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on the rate at which capitalized costs are amortized.\nThe determination of ultimate revenue for capitalized film and television costs requires the Company to make significant estimates of future revenue based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The determination of ultimate revenue for multiyear, live-event sports programming rights requires the Company to make significant estimates of future revenue based on historical and expected trends in the advertising market as well as the number of subscribers receiving or viewing the sports programming. Given the judgments necessary to estimate ultimate revenue, auditing these estimates involved especially subjective judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to forecasts of ultimate revenue for individual film or television productions and for sports programming rights included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over its amortization of film and television costs and sports programming rights, including controls over forecasts of ultimate revenue.\n\u2022For film and television productions, we tested management\u2019s selection of inputs and assumptions, including considering the historical performance of similar titles, expected distribution platforms, factors unique to the individual film or television production, and third-party projections. In addition, we evaluated the historical accuracy of management\u2019s forecast of future revenues by comparing actual results to management\u2019s historical estimates of ultimate revenue.\n\u2022For certain multiyear live-events sports programming rights, we evaluated management\u2019s assessment of any significant changes to the estimated relative value of the rights including any significant contract amendments, changes to expected trends in the advertising market, and number of subscribers receiving or viewing the sports programming.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 3, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1963.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nYear ended December 31 (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 2018\nRevenue $ 103,564 $ 108,942 $ 94,507\nCosts and Expenses:\nProgramming and production 33,121 34,440 29,692\nOther operating and administrative 33,109 32,807 28,094\nAdvertising, marketing and promotion 6,741 7,617 7,036\nDepreciation 8,320 8,663 8,281\nAmortization 4,780 4,290 2,736\nOther operating gains -

The related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheet. Any foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in our consolidated statement of income in investment and other income (loss), net. For disclosures containing future amounts where the functional currency is the local currency, we translate the amounts into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date.\nAccounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to select accounting policies, including in certain cases industry-specific policies, and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following accounting policies are specific to the industries in which we operate:\n\u2022capitalization and amortization of film and television costs (see Note 4)\n\u2022costs for connecting customers to our cable systems (see Note 10)\nInformation on other accounting policies and methods that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are included, where applicable, in their respective footnotes that follow. The collateralized obligation related to our investment in Hulu is discussed in Note 9 and our other long-term debt is discussed in Note 6. Below is a discussion of accounting policies and methods used in our consolidated financial statements that are not presented within other footnotes.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Our objective is to manage the financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivatives used to economically hedge them.\nOur derivative financial instruments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. We designate certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions, including cash flows associated with non-functional currency debt and non-functional currency revenue and expenses. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged items affect earnings. For derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nRefer to Note 6 for further information on derivative instruments related to debt. The impact of our remaining derivative financial instruments was not material to our consolidated financial statements in any of the periods presented.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe accounting guidance related to fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques. The levels of the hierarchy are described below.\n\u2022Level 1: Values are determined using quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market.\n\u2022Level 2: Values are determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.\n\u2022Level 3: Values are determined using models that use significant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nWe use the three tier fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of certain financial instruments on a recurring basis, such as for investments (see Note 9); on a non-recurring basis, such as for acquisitions and impairment testing; and for disclosure purposes, such as for long-term debt (see Note 6). Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation and classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nNote 2: Segment Information\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks; and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. See Note 3 for a description of the various products and services within each reportable segment.\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, such as Peacock, our new direct-to-consumer streaming service that features NBCUniversal content.\nOur financial data by reportable segment is presented in the tables below.

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue at Cable Networks for the sale of programming to Cable Communications; content licensing revenue in our NBCUniversal segments (Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Cable Networks) for the license of owned content to Peacock and Sky, and for licenses of owned content to other NBCUniversal segments; advertising revenue at Cable Communications, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television; and distribution revenue at Broadcast Television for fees received under retransmission consent agreements from Cable Communications. For segment reporting purposes, we account for intercompany content licenses as follows:\n\u2022Revenue for licenses of content from NBCUniversal segments to Peacock and Sky are generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses at Peacock and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations as the profits on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period.\n\u2022Revenue for licenses of content between NBCUniversal segments is recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of the licensed content as the content is used over the license period.\n(b)We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. From time to time we may report the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges related to our operating segments (such as certain costs incurred in response to COVID-19, including severance charges), within Corporate and Other. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 30,826 $ 34,258 $ 30,165\nAdjustment for legal settlement (177) - (125)\nAdjustment for Sky transaction-related costs (56) (180) (355)\nDepreciation (8,320) (8,663) (8,281)\nAmortization (4,780) (4,290) (2,736)\nOther operating gains - - 341\nInterest expense (4,588) (4,567) (3,542)\nInvestment and other income (loss), net 1,160 438 (225)\nIncome before income taxes $ 14,065 $ 16,996 $ 15,242\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nNote 3: Revenue\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nResidential:\nHigh-speed internet $ 20,599 $ 18,752 $ 17,144\nVideo 21,937 22,270 22,455\nVoice 3,532 3,879 3,960\nWireless 1,574 1,167 890\nBusiness services 8,191 7,795 7,129\nAdvertising 2,594 2,465 2,795\nOther 1,624 1,754 1,660\nTotal Cable Communications 60,051 58,082 56,033\nDistribution 6,437 6,790 6,826\nAdvertising 3,155 3,478 3,587\nContent licensing and other 1,257 1,245 1,360\nTotal Cable Networks 10,849 11,513 11,773\nAdvertising 5,027 5,712 7,010\nContent licensing 2,640 2,157 2,182\nDistribution and other 2,577 2,392 2,247\nTotal Broadcast Television 10,244 10,261 11,439\nTheatrical 421 1,469 2,111\nContent licensing 3,342 3,045 2,899\nHome entertainment 944 957 1,048\nOther 569 1,022 1,094\nTotal Filmed Entertainment 5,276 6,493 7,152\nTotal Theme Parks 1,846 5,933 5,683\nHeadquarters and Other 121 83 63\nEliminations(a)\n(254) (316) (349)\nTotal NBCUniversal 28,082 33,967 35,761\nDirect-to-consumer 15,223 15,538 3,632\nContent 1,373 1,432 304\nAdvertising 1,998 2,249 651\nTotal Sky 18,594 19,219 4,587\nCorporate and Other 366 333 513\nEliminations(a)\n(3,529) (2,659) (2,387)\nTotal revenue $ 103,564 $ 108,942 $ 94,507\n(a)Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. See Note 2 for a description of these transactions.\nWe operate primarily in the United States but also in select international markets. The table below summarizes revenue by geographic location.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nUnited States $ 80,327 $ 82,952 $ 82,233\nEurope 20,460 21,553 7,721\nOther 2,777 4,437 4,553\nTotal revenue $ 103,564 $ 108,942 $ 94,507\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 80\nComcast Corporation\nCable Communications Segment\nRevenue is generated from the sale of our high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless and other services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand, which we market individually and as bundled services at a discounted rate. We also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising.\nResidential\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Subscription rates and related charges vary according to the services and features customers receive. Revenue from customers that purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is allocated between the separate services based on the respective stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the current prices at which we separately sell the services. Significant judgment is used to determine performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and the allocation of revenue when services are combined in a bundle. Customers are typically billed in advance and pay on a monthly basis. Installation fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of benefit to the customer, which is less than a year. While a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are typically 1 to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services on a basis that is consistent with our customers that are not subject to contracts. Our services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as set-top boxes, cable modems and wireless gateways. The timing and pattern of recognition for customer premise equipment revenue are consistent with those of our services. We recognize revenue from the sale of wireless handsets at the point of sale. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year. We also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are generally the sales agent in these arrangements and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within high-speed internet revenues.\nUnder the terms of cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue. We generally pass these and other similar fees through to our customers and classify these fees in the respective Cable Communications services revenue, with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.\nBusiness Services\nRevenue is generated from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our service offerings for small business locations primarily include high-speed internet services, as well as voice and video services, that are similar to those provided to residential customers, and include certain other features specific to businesses. We also offer Ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and other services to meet the needs of medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators.\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging from 2 years for small and medium-sized businesses to up to 5 years for larger enterprises. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual business services revenue, of which the substantial majority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers with contracts may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We receive payments based on a billing schedule established in our contracts, which is typically on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\nAdvertising\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to multichannel video providers in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on digital platforms. We enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and the timing of airing is scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from when advertisements are aired or viewed. In addition, we also provide technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry, which allows advertisers to more effectively engage with their target audiences. Revenue earned in this manner is recognized when services are provided.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nNBCUniversal Segments\nDistribution\nCable Networks generates revenue from the distribution of our national, regional and international cable network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. Broadcast Television generates revenue from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements for our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated local broadcast television stations.\nThese arrangements are accounted for as licenses of functional intellectual property and revenue is recognized as programming is provided on a monthly basis, generally under multiyear agreements. Monthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally based on the number of subscribers. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment within 60 days.\nAdvertising\nCable Networks and Broadcast Television generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our cable and broadcast networks, our owned local broadcast television stations and various digital properties.\nWe enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and the timing of airing is scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days. In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in contracts where the ratings were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\nTheatrical\nFilmed Entertainment generates revenue from the worldwide theatrical release of produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. Our arrangements with exhibitors generally entitle us to a percentage of ticket sales. We recognize revenue as the films are viewed and exhibited in theaters and payment generally occurs within 30 days after exhibition.\nContent Licensing\nCable Networks\u2019, Broadcast Television\u2019s and Filmed Entertainment\u2019s production studios generate revenue from the licensing of our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to cable, broadcast and premium networks and to DTC streaming service providers. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film\u2019s theatrical release, Filmed Entertainment may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue at the later of when the content is available or when the renewal or extension period begins. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements at any given time equals approximately 1 to 2 years of annual Filmed Entertainment content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this future revenue. The majority of this revenue will be recognized within 2 years. This amount may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\nHome Entertainment\nFilmed Entertainment generates revenue from the sale of our produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Cable Networks and Broadcast Television also generate revenue from the sale of owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services, which is reported in other revenue. We generally recognize revenue from DVD sales, net of estimated returns and customer incentives, on the date that DVDs are delivered to and made available for sale by retailers. Payment terms generally include payment within 60 to 90 days from delivery to the retailer.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 82\nComcast Corporation\nTheme Parks\nTheme Parks generates revenue primarily from guest spending at our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. Guest spending includes ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise. We recognize revenue from ticket sales when the tickets are used, generally within a year from the date of purchase. For annual passes, we generally recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the period the pass is available to be used. We recognize revenue from in-park spending at the point of sale.\nSky Segment\nDirect-to-Consumer\nRevenue is generated from subscribers to our video services from both residential and business customers, primarily in the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. We also provide high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services in select countries. Generally, all of our residential customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging from rolling monthly to 18 months, depending on the product and territory, and may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. Subscription rates and related charges vary according to the services and features customers receive and the types of equipment they use. Our video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services generally may be purchased individually or in bundles. We recognize revenue from video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services as the services are provided on a monthly basis. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to existing agreements is equal to less than half of our annual direct-to-consumer revenue, which generally will be recognized within 18 months.\nContent\nRevenue is generated from the distribution of our television channels on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and acquired programming to third-party video providers. See the NBCUniversal segment discussion of distribution and content licensing revenue above for accounting policies for these types of arrangements.\nAdvertising\nRevenue is generated from advertising and sponsorships across our owned television channels and where we represent the sales efforts of third-party channels. We also generate revenue from the sale of advertising on digital platforms and various technology, tools and solutions relating to our advertising business. Revenue is recognized when the advertising is aired or viewed. Since we are acting as the principal in the arrangements where we represent the sales efforts of third parties, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to the third-party channels in other operating and administrative expenses.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nThe following table summarizes our accounts receivable:\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2020 2019\nReceivables, gross $ 12,273 $ 11,711\nLess: Allowance for doubtful accounts 807 419\nReceivables, net $ 11,466 $ 11,292\nThe following table presents changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts:\n(in millions) Beginning Balance Additions Charged to Costs and Expenses and Other Accounts Deductions from Reserves Ending Balance\n2020 $ 419 $ 912 $ 524 $ 807\n2019 $ 352 $ 769 $ 702 $ 419\n2018 $ 288 $ 616 $ 552 $ 352\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nThe following table summarizes our other balances that are not separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet that relate to the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash, as well as the deferred costs associated with our contracts with customers:\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2020 2019\nNoncurrent receivables, net (included in other noncurrent assets, net) $ 1,091 $ 1,337\nContract acquisition and fulfillment costs (included in other noncurrent assets, net) $ 1,060 $ 1,083\nNoncurrent deferred revenue (included in other noncurrent liabilities) $ 750 $ 618\nNote 4: Programming and Production Costs\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020\nVideo distribution programming $ 12,684\nFilm and television content:\nOwned(a)\n7,973\nLicensed, including sports rights 11,264\nOther 1,200\nTotal programming and production costs $ 33,121\n(a) Amount includes amortization of owned content of $6.6 billion as well as participations and residuals expense.\nVideo Distribution Programming Expenses\nWe incur programming expenses related to the license of rights to distribute the third-party programmed channels, platforms and related content included in video services we sell to end consumers. Programming is generally acquired under multiyear distribution agreements, with fees typically based on the number of customers that receive the programming and the extent of distribution. Programming arrangements are accounted for as executory contracts with expenses generally recognized based on the rates in the agreements and the arrangements are not subject to impairment.\nFilm and Television Content\nWe incur costs related to the production of owned content and the license of the rights to use content owned by third parties and sports rights on our owned networks and platforms, which are described as owned and licensed content, respectively. We adopted new accounting guidance related to film and television content in the first quarter of 2020 (see Note 8), and accordingly, amounts presented below for 2020 and the policy discussion reflect the updated accounting guidance, and amounts presented for 2019 reflect the accounting guidance in effect at that time. Under the new accounting guidance, we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis.\nCapitalized Film and Television Costs\n2020 2019\nDecember 31 (in millions) Film and Television Costs Film Costs Television Costs Total\nOwned:\nReleased, less amortization $ 3,815 $ 1,551 $ 2,810 $ 4,361\nCompleted, not released 139 187 - 187\nIn production and in development 2,755 1,314 1,162 2,476\n6,709 3,052 3,972 7,024\nLicensed, including sports advances 6,631 5,786\n13,340 12,810\nLess: Current portion of licensed programming rights - 3,877\nFilm and television costs $ 13,340 $ 8,933\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 84\nComcast Corporation\nThe table below summarizes estimated future amortization expense for the capitalized film and television costs recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\n(in millions) Owned Licensed\nCompleted, not released:\n2021 $ 69\nReleased and licensed content:\n2021 $ 1,445 $ 4,722\n2022 $ 543 $ 820\n2023 $ 336 $ 470\nWe have future minimum commitments for sports rights and licensed content that are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 totaling $38.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.\nCapitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Content\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residual payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\nWe may enter into cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. Cofinancing arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor\u2019s interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor\u2019s interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participation and residual payments in programming and production costs.\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nSports Rights\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content.\nNote 5: Income Taxes\nIncome Before Income Taxes\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nDomestic $ 16,211 $ 16,646 $ 14,387\nForeign (2,146) 350 855\n$ 14,065 $ 16,996 $ 15,242\nComponents of Income Tax (Expense) Benefit\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nCurrent (Expense) Benefit:\nFederal $ (2,824) $ (2,085) $ (2,026)\nState (836) (425) (639)\nForeign (254) (600) (425)\n(3,914) (3,110) (3,090)\nDeferred (Expense) Benefit:\nFederal 111 (902) (546)\nState 71 15 167\nForeign 368 324 89\n550 (563) (290)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit $ (3,364) $ (3,673) $ (3,380)\nOur income tax (expense) benefit differs from the federal statutory amount because of the effect of the items detailed in the table below.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nFederal tax at statutory rate $ (2,954) $ (3,569) $ (3,201)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit (265) (306) (212)\nForeign income taxed at different rates (24) (126) (147)\nAdjustments to uncertain and effectively settled tax positions, net (344) (3) (144)\nFederal research and development credits 164 124 22\nExcess tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation 150 196 75\nOther (91) 11 227\nIncome tax (expense) benefit $ (3,364) $ (3,673) $ (3,380)\nWe base our provision for income taxes on our current period income, changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions, tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate and excess tax benefits or deficiencies that arise when the tax consequences of share-based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in the statement of income. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when there are temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and for the expected benefits of using net operating loss carryforwards. When a change in the tax rate or tax law has an impact on deferred taxes, we apply the change based on the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We record the change in our consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment.\nThe determination of the income tax consequences of a business combination includes identifying the tax basis of assets and liabilities acquired and any contingencies associated with uncertain tax positions assumed or resulting from the business combination. Deferred tax assets and liabilities related to temporary differences of an acquired entity are recorded as of the date of the business combination and are based on our estimate of the ultimate tax basis that will be accepted by the various tax authorities. We record liabilities for contingencies associated with prior tax returns filed by the acquired entity based on criteria set forth in the appropriate accounting guidance. We adjust the deferred tax accounts and the liabilities periodically to reflect\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 86\nComcast Corporation\nany revised estimated tax basis and any estimated settlements with the various tax authorities. The effects of these adjustments are recorded to income tax (expense) benefit.\nFrom time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. In these cases, we evaluate our tax position using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions, including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions, certain financing transactions, and the allocation of income among state and local tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We classify interest and penalties, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax (expense) benefit.\nComponents of Net Deferred Tax Liability\nDecember 31 (in millions) 2020 2019\nDeferred Tax Assets:\nNet operating loss and other loss carryforwards $ 2,609 $ 2,017\nNondeductible accruals and other 3,253 2,779\nLess: Valuation allowance 2,312 1,906\n3,550 2,890\nDeferred Tax Liabilities:\nDifferences between book and tax basis of property and equipment and intangible assets 29,829 29,387\nDifferences between book and tax basis of investments 405 702\nDifferences between book and tax basis of long-term debt 680 751\nDifferences between book and tax basis of foreign subsidiaries and undistributed foreign earnings\n468 143\n31,382 30,983\nNet deferred tax liability $ 27,832 $ 28,093\nThe following table presents changes in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets:\n(in millions) Beginning Balance Additions Charged to Income Tax Expense and Other Accounts Deductions from Reserves Ending Balance\n2020 $ 1,906 $ 430 $ 24 $ 2,312\n2019 $ 632 $ 1,403 $ 129 $ 1,906\n2018 $ 377 $ 367 $ 112 $ 632\nChanges in our net deferred tax liability in 2020 that were not recorded as deferred income tax benefit (expense) are primarily related to an increase of $330 million associated with items included in other comprehensive income (loss).\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $196 million, and various state net operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which expire in periods through 2040. As of December 31, 2020, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $7.6 billion related to the foreign operations of Sky and NBCUniversal, the majority of which can be carried forward indefinitely. The determination of the realization of the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on our subsidiaries\u2019 taxable income or loss, apportionment percentages, redetermination from taxing authorities, and state and foreign laws that can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforwards. We recognize a valuation allowance if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our valuation allowance was primarily related to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nUncertain Tax Positions\nReconciliation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\n(in millions)\n2020 2019 2018\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, January 1 $ 1,422 $ 1,543 $ 1,497\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 436 230 229\nAdditions based on tax positions related to prior years 152 133 125\nAdditions from acquired subsidiaries - 1 130\nReductions for tax positions of prior years (31) (344) (346)\nReductions due to expiration of statutes of limitations (76) (117) (75)\nSettlements with tax authorities (24) (24) (17)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, December 31 $ 1,879 $ 1,422 $ 1,543\nOur gross unrecognized tax benefits include both amounts related to positions for which we have recorded liabilities for potential payment obligations and those for which tax has been assessed and paid. The amounts exclude the federal benefits on state tax positions that were recorded to deferred income taxes. If we were to recognize our gross unrecognized tax benefits in the future, $1.4 billion would impact our effective tax rate and the remaining amount would increase our deferred income tax liability. The amount and timing of the recognition of any such tax benefit is dependent on the completion of examinations of our tax filings by the various tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations. It is reasonably possible that certain tax contests could be resolved within the next 12 months that may result in a decrease in our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, accrued interest and penalties associated with our liability for uncertain tax positions were not material.\nThe IRS has completed its examination of our income tax returns for all years through 2016. Various states are examining our state tax returns and the tax years of those tax returns currently under examination vary by state, with most of the periods relating to tax years 2000 and forward. Various foreign jurisdictions are examining our tax returns and the tax years of those tax returns currently under examination vary by country, with most of the periods relating to tax years 2010 and forward.\nNote 6: Long-Term Debt\nLong-Term Debt Outstanding\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nWeighted-Average\nInterest Rate as of\nDecember 31, 2020 Weighted-Average Interest Rate as of December 31, 2019 2020(b)\n2019(b)\nTerm loans 2.07 % 1.87 % 7,641 8,078\nSenior notes with maturities of 5 years or less, at face value 3.41 % 3.29 % 19,190 26,378\nSenior notes with maturities between 5 and 10 years, at face value 3.47 % 3.74 % 23,114 21,683\nSenior notes with maturities greater than 10 years, at face value 4.03 % 4.54 % 54,203 46,653\nOther, including finance lease obligations 1,261 1,098\nDebt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net(a)\n(1,649) (1,673)\nTotal debt 3.60 % (a)\n3.78 % (a)\n103,760 102,217\nLess: Current portion 3,146 4,452\nLong-term debt $ 100,614 $ 97,765\n(a)Includes the effects of our derivative financial instruments.\n(b)As of December 31, 2020, included in our outstanding debt were foreign currency denominated borrowings with principal amounts of \u00a34.7 billion, \u20ac7.3 billion, \u00a5238.5 billion and \u00a516.4 billion RMB. As of December 31, 2019, included in our outstanding debt were foreign currency denominated borrowings with principal amounts of \u00a34.9 billion, \u20ac4.9 billion, \u00a5267 billion and \u00a59 billion RMB.\nOur senior notes are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations and are subject to parent and/or subsidiary guarantees. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our debt had an estimated fair value of $125.6 billion and $115.8 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 88\nComcast Corporation\nPrincipal Maturities of Debt\n(in millions)\n2021 $ 3,133\n2022 $ 4,028\n2023 $ 3,925\n2024 $ 6,746\n2025 $ 6,953\nThereafter $ 80,624\nWe use cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. Cross-currency swaps effectively convert foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency, which hedge currency exchange risks associated with foreign currency denominated cash flows such as interest and principal debt repayments. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges on $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion of our foreign currency denominated debt, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate estimated fair values of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges were a net liability of $45 million and a net asset of $373 million, respectively.\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on the consolidation of our foreign operations. We have foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of our net investments in certain of these subsidiaries. Transaction gains and losses resulting from currency movements on debt and changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are recorded within the currency translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using foreign currency denominated debt was $10.3 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively, and the amount of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries hedged using cross-currency swaps was $4.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate estimated fair value of these cross-currency swaps was a net liability of $376 million and $373 million, respectively. The amount of pre-tax gains (losses) related to net investment hedges recognized in the cumulative translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income (loss) were losses of $686 million in 2020, gains of $343 million in 2019 and losses of $3 million in 2018.\nRevolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $9.2 billion of revolving credit facilities due 2022 with a syndicate of banks that may be used for general corporate purposes. In June 2019, we amended the terms of our revolving credit facilities to extend their expiration dates from May 26, 2021 to May 26, 2022. We may increase the commitment under the revolving credit facilities up to a total of $12 billion, as well as extend the expiration dates to no later than 2023, subject to approval of the lenders. The interest rates on the revolving credit facilities consist of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcast\u2019s credit rating. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing margin for borrowings based on the London Interbank Offered Rate was 1.00%. Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain certain financial ratios based on debt and EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit facilities. We were in compliance with all financial covenants for all periods presented.\nOur commercial paper programs are supported by our revolving credit facility and provides a lower cost source of borrowing to fund short-term working capital requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs or revolving credit facilities. As of December 31, 2020, amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion.\nLetters of Credit and Bank Guarantees\nAs of December 31, 2020, we and certain of our subsidiaries had undrawn irrevocable standby letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling $320 million to cover potential fundings under various agreements.\nNote 7: Significant Transactions\nSky Transaction\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired Sky for \u00a317.28 per Sky share and total cash consideration of \u00a330.2 billion (approximately $39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). We financed the acquisition through a combination of fixed and floating rate senior notes, the issuance of term loans and cash on hand.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAs a result of the Sky transaction, we incurred expenses in 2018 related to legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services, which are reflected in other operating and administrative expenses. We also incurred certain financing costs associated with our borrowings, which are reflected in interest expense. The table below presents the amounts related to these expenses included in our consolidated statement of income. The amounts below do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or costs related to synergies that may be achieved as a result of the acquisition.\n(in millions) Year ended December 31, 2018\nOther operating and administrative expenses $ 339\nInterest expense $ 63\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma information has been presented as if the Sky transaction occurred on January 1, 2017. This information is based on historical results of operations, adjusted for allocation of purchase price and other acquisition accounting adjustments, and is not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the business since January 1, 2017. For pro forma purposes, 2018 earnings were adjusted to exclude acquisition-related costs noted above. No pro forma adjustments have been made for cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. The years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are not presented as Sky is included in the consolidated results for those periods.\nYear ended December 31 (in millions, except per share data) 2018\nRevenue $ 109,518\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 12,176\nBasic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 2.66\nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 2.62\nUniversal Beijing Resort\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate Universal Beijing Resort, a theme park and resort in Beijing, China. We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of \u00a526.6 billion RMB (approximately $4 billion). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2020, Universal Beijing Resort had $2.5 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a variable interest entity based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort\u2019s results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the \u201cconstruction of Universal Beijing Resort\u201d and \u201cproceeds from borrowings\u201d captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\nIn March 2018, Universal Beijing Resort received initial equity investments through a combination of cash and noncash contributions from the investors. As of December 31, 2020, our consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loan, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $5.1 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 90\nComcast Corporation\nNote 8: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nFilm and Television Content\nIn March 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) updated the accounting guidance related to film and television content. The updated guidance aligned the accounting for production costs of owned episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The guidance also updated certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television content, and when content is predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content the guidance requires impairment testing for capitalized film and television content to be performed at a film group level and amortization to be based on usage. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted.\nFollowing the adoption, we now present all capitalized film and television content, including licensed content and sports advances previously classified as current programming rights, as noncurrent film and television costs in the consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 4 for further information.\nCredit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables and loans. The updated guidance requires the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of expected losses, replacing the incurred loss model in the prior guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis, recording $124 million, net of tax, as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for any periods presented.\nNote 9: Investments\nInvestment and Other Income (Loss), Net\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n2020 2019 2018\nEquity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ (113) $ (505) $ (364)\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 1,014 656 (187)\nOther income (loss), net 259 287 326\nInvestment and other income (loss), net $ 1,160 $ 438 $ (225)\nThe amount of unrealized gains (losses) recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period was $339 million, $237 million and $(200) million, respectively.\nInvestments\nDecember 31 (in millions)\n2020 2019\nEquity method $ 6,006 $ 5,347\nMarketable equity securities 460 353\nNonmarketable equity securities 1,950 1,896\nOther investments 143 1,796\nTotal investments 8,559 9,392\nLess: Current investments 292 1,709\nLess: Investment securing collateralized obligation 447 694\nNoncurrent investments $ 7,820 $ 6,989\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nEquity Method\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee\u2019s operating and financial policies, or in which we hold a partnership or limited liability company interest in an entity with specific ownership accounts, unless we have virtually no influence over the investee\u2019s operating and financial policies. Equity method investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted to recognize (1) our share, based on percentage ownership or other contractual basis, of the investee\u2019s net income or loss after the date of investment, (2) amortization of the recorded investment that exceeds our share of the book value of the investee\u2019s net assets, (3) additional contributions made and dividends received, and (4) impairments resulting from other-than-temporary declines in fair value. For some investments, we record our share of the investee\u2019s net income or loss one quarter in arrears due to the timing of our receipt of such information. Gains or losses on the sale of equity method investments are recorded to other income (loss), net. If an equity method investee were to issue additional securities that would change our proportionate share of the entity, we would recognize the change, if any, as a gain or loss to other income (loss), net.\nAtairos\nOn January 1, 2016, we established Atairos Group, Inc., a strategic company focused on investing in and operating companies in a range of industries and business sectors, both domestically and internationally. Atairos is controlled by management companies led by our former CFO through interests that carry all of the voting rights. We are the only third-party investor in Atairos.\nIn November 2020, we amended our agreement with Atairos, which primarily extended the investment term of the agreement from up to 12 years to up to 16.5 years, extended the period in which capital can be recycled to the full investment period and decreased our commitment to fund Atairos from up to $5 billion to up to $4.5 billion in the aggregate at any one time, subject to certain offsets, with the maximum amount of annual capital calls reduced to $400 million, plus certain amounts previously distributed. In addition, we have separately committed to fund Atairos $45 million annually for a management fee, subject to certain adjustments. The management company investors have committed to fund from $50 million to $100 million, with at least $40 million to be funded by our former CFO, subject to his continued role with Atairos. Our economic interests do not carry voting rights and obligate us to absorb approximately 99% of any losses and they provide us the right to receive approximately 86% of any residual returns in Atairos, in either case on a cumulative basis.\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairos as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements. This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we made cash capital contributions totaling $383 million, $571 million and $282 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our investment was $3.9 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.\nIn April 2018, we sold a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses to Atairos and received as consideration additional equity interests in Atairos. In connection with the sale of the businesses, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $200 million in other operating gains.\nHulu and Collateralized Obligation\nIn May 2019, we entered into a series of agreements (the \u201cHulu Transaction\u201d) with The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries, whereby we relinquished our board seats and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. We also acquired our proportionate share of the approximate 10% interest in Hulu previously held by AT&T for approximately $477 million, increasing our ownership interest to approximately 33% from approximately 30%.\nFollowing the Hulu Transaction, future capital calls are limited to $1.5 billion in the aggregate each year, with any excess funding requirements funded with member loans. We have the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of these capital calls, and if we elect not to fund our share of future equity capital calls, our ownership interest will be diluted, subject to an ownership floor of 21%. The Hulu Transaction agreements include put and call provisions regarding our\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 92\nComcast Corporation\nownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we can require Disney to buy, and Disney can require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. The minimum total equity value and ownership floor guarantee minimum proceeds of approximately $5.8 billion upon exercise of the put or call.\nIn connection with the Hulu Transaction, we agreed to extend certain licenses of NBCUniversal content until late 2024. We can terminate most of our content license agreements with Hulu beginning in 2022, and beginning in 2020, we have the right to modify certain content licenses that are currently exclusive to Hulu, so that we can exhibit the content on our platforms in return for reducing the license fee.\nIn August 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024. The principal amount of the term loan is secured by the proceeds guaranteed by Disney under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. The proceeds from the put/call provisions are available only for the repayment of the term loan and are not available to us unless and until the bank lenders are fully paid under the term loan provisions. The bank lenders have no rights to proceeds from the put/call provisions in excess of amounts owed under the term loan. As a result of this transaction, we now present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our consolidated balance sheet in the captions \u201cinvestment securing collateralized obligation\u201d and \u201ccollateralized obligation\u201d, respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. As of December 31, 2020, our collateralized obligation had both a carrying value and estimated fair value of $5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nMarketable Equity Securities\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\nNonmarketable Equity Securities\nWe classify investments without readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as nonmarketable equity securities. The accounting guidance requires nonmarketable equity securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement alternative, which is to record the investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We apply the measurement alternative, adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, to a majority of our nonmarketable equity securities. When an observable event occurs, we estimate the fair values of our nonmarketable equity securities primarily based on Level 2 inputs that are derived from observable price changes of similar securities adjusted for insignificant differences in rights and obligations. The changes in value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.\nOther Investments\nAirTouch\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Verizon Americas, Inc., formerly known as AirTouch Communications, Inc.

As of December 31, 2019, our investment in AirTouch was $1.6 billion, and was included in other current assets.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we redeemed and repurchased the related three series of preferred shares issued by one of our consolidated subsidiaries and made cash payments totaling $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2019, the two series of redeemable subsidiary preferred shares and the one series of nonredeemable subsidiary preferred shares were recorded at $1.7 billion and $100 million, respectively, and were included in other current liabilities and in noncontrolling interests, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nImpairment Testing of Investments\nWe review our investment portfolio, other than our marketable equity securities, each reporting period to determine whether there are identified events or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value. For our nonpublic investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated. For our equity method investments and held to maturity investments, if an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. For our nonmarketable equity securities, we record the impairment to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For our equity method investments and our held to maturity investments, we record the impairment to other income (loss), net.\nNote 10: Property and Equipment\nDecember 31 (in millions)\nWeighted-Average\nOriginal Useful Life\nas of December 31, 2020 2020 2019\nDistribution systems 11 years $ 40,861 $ 40,639\nCustomer premise equipment 6 years 26,323 26,065\nBuildings, theme park infrastructure and leasehold improvements 31 years 15,885 15,104\nOther equipment 9 years 14,371 13,025\nConstruction in process N/A 7,095 5,245\nLand N/A 1,848 1,483\nProperty and equipment, at cost 106,383 101,561\nLess: Accumulated depreciation 54,388 53,239\nProperty and equipment, net $ 51,995 $ 48,322\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. We capitalize improvements that extend asset lives and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred. We record depreciation using the straight-line method over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation and, unless the gain or loss on disposition is presented separately, we recognize it as a component of depreciation expense. Capital expenditures for the construction of Universal Beijing Resort are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nCable Communications capitalizes the costs associated with the construction of and improvements to our cable transmission and distribution facilities, including scalable infrastructure and line extensions; costs associated with acquiring and deploying new customer premise equipment; and costs associated with installation of our services, including the customer\u2019s connection to our network, in accordance with the accounting guidance related to cable television companies. Costs capitalized include all direct costs for labor and materials, as well as various indirect costs. Costs incurred in connection with subsequent disconnects, and reconnects of previously deployed customer premise equipment, are expensed as they are incurred.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of depreciation expense.\nCertain of our cable franchise agreements and lease agreements contain provisions requiring us to restore facilities or remove property in the event that the franchise or lease agreement is not renewed. We expect to continually renew our cable franchise agreements and therefore cannot reasonably estimate liabilities associated with such agreements. A remote possibility exists that franchise agreements could be terminated unexpectedly, which could result in us incurring significant expense in complying with restoration or removal provisions. We do not have any material liabilities related to asset retirement obligations recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 94\nComcast Corporation\nNote 11: Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nNBCUniversal\n(in millions)\nCable\nCommunications\nCable\nNetworks\nBroadcast\nTelevision\nFilmed\nEntertainment\nTheme\nParks\nSky Corporate\nand Other\nTotal\nBalance, December 31, 2018 $ 12,784 $ 13,407 $ 843 $ 3,184 $ 6,684 $ 29,250 $ 2 $ 66,154\nAcquisitions 86 162 14 - - 17 - 279\nDispositions - - - - - (12) - (12)\nAdjustments(a)\n2,166 490 199 138 - (1,616) 2 1,379\nForeign currency translation 38 8 3 (1) 55 822 - 925\nBalance, December 31, 2019 15,074 14,067 1,059 3,321 6,739 28,461 4 68,725\nAcquisitions\n122 - - 27 - - - 149\nDispositions - - - - - - (4) (4)\nAdjustments (5) (85) - - - (8) 2 (96)\nForeign currency translation\n73 12 3 (4) 314 1,497 - 1,895\nBalance, December 31, 2020 $ 15,264 $ 13,994 $ 1,062 $ 3,344 $ 7,053 $ 29,950 $ 2 $ 70,669\n(a)Adjustments in 2019 primarily included 1) measurement period adjustments resulting from finalization of acquisition accounting for Sky and 2) the final assignment of goodwill resulting from the Sky transaction to our reporting units.\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from anticipated synergies and intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint, assembled workforce, noncontractual relationships and other agreements. We assess the recoverability of our goodwill annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.

Our cable franchise rights represent the values we attributed to agreements with state and local authorities that allow access to homes and businesses in cable service areas acquired in business combinations. We do not amortize our cable franchise rights because we have determined that they meet the definition of indefinite-lived intangible assets since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. We reassess this determination periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The purchase of spectrum rights is presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nWe assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Our three Cable Communications divisions represent the unit of account we use to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information. If the fair value of our cable franchise rights or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense. We did not recognize any material impairment charges in any of the periods presented.\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nEstimated Amortization Expense of Finite-Lived Intangible Assets\n(in millions)\n2021 $ 4,589\n2022 $ 4,087\n2023 $ 3,472\n2024 $ 2,774\n2025 $ 2,412\nFinite-lived intangible assets are subject to amortization and consist primarily of customer relationships acquired in business combinations, software, trade names and intellectual property rights. Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or the term of the associated agreement.\nWe capitalize direct development costs associated with internal-use software, including external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees devoting time to these software projects. We also capitalize costs associated with the purchase of software licenses. We generally amortize them on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed five years. We expense maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of a project, as they are incurred. We capitalize initial operating system software costs and amortize them over the life of the associated hardware.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 96\nComcast Corporation\nNote 12: Employee Benefit Plans\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nBenefit obligation $ 3,648 $ 3,273 $ 2,885\nInterest expense $ 293 $ 285 $ 222\nWe maintain unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plans for certain members of management and nonemployee directors. The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participant accounts are credited with income primarily based on a fixed annual rate. Participants are eligible to receive distributions from their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.\nWe have purchased life insurance policies to recover a portion of the future payments related to our deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cash surrender value of these policies, which is recorded to other noncurrent assets, net, was $481 million and $423 million, respectively.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor several 401(k) defined contribution retirement plans that allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation through payroll deductions in accordance with specified plan guidelines. We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees\u2019 contributions up to certain limits. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, expenses related to these plans totaled $599 million, $573 million and $546 million, respectively.\nWe participate in various multiemployer benefit plans, including pension and postretirement benefit plans, that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We also participate in other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare and retirement savings benefits to active and retired participants. If we cease to be obligated to make contributions or were to otherwise withdraw from participation in any of these plans, applicable law would require us to fund our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits, which is known as a withdrawal liability. In addition, actions taken by other participating employers may lead to adverse changes in the financial condition of one of these plans, which could result in an increase in our withdrawal liability. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the total contributions we made to multiemployer benefit plans were not material.\nNote 13: Equity\nCommon Stock\nIn the aggregate, holders of our Class A common stock have 662/3% of the voting power of our common stock and holders of our Class B common stock have 331/3% of the voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Each share of our Class B common stock is entitled to 15 votes. The number of votes held by each share of our Class A common stock depends on the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding at any given time. The 331/3% aggregate voting power of our Class B common stock cannot be diluted by additional issuances of any other class of common stock. Our Class B common stock is convertible, share for share, into Class A common stock, subject to certain restrictions.\nShares of Common Stock Outstanding\n(in millions)\nClass A Class B\nBalance, December 31, 2017 4,635 9\nStock compensation plans 15 -\nRepurchases and retirements of common stock (140) -\nEmployee stock purchase plans 7 -\nBalance, December 31, 2018 4,517 9\nStock compensation plans 21 -\nEmployee stock purchase plans 6 -\nBalance, December 31, 2019 4,544 9\nStock compensation plans 20 -\nEmployee stock purchase plans 7 -\nBalance, December 31, 2020 4,571 9\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nComcast Corporation\nWeighted-Average Common Shares Outstanding\nYear ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding - basic 4,574 4,548 4,584\nEffect of dilutive securities 50 62 56\nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding - diluted\n4,624 4,610 4,640\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding used in calculating diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders (\u201cdiluted EPS\u201d) considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method.

Awards generally vest over a period of 5 years and, in the case of stock options, have a 10 year term. Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. As of December 31, 2020, all of our stock options outstanding were net settled stock options, which result in fewer shares being issued and no cash proceeds being received by us when the options are exercised.\nStock Options and Restricted Share Units\nAs of December 31, 2020, unless otherwise stated (in millions, except per share data) Stock\nOptions RSUs\nAwards granted during 2020 61 18\nWeighted-average exercise price of awards granted during 2020 $ 42.42\nStock options outstanding and nonvested RSUs 210 49\nWeighted-average exercise price of stock options outstanding $ 35.94\nWeighted-average fair value at grant date of nonvested RSUs $ 38.87\nThe cost associated with our share-based compensation is based on an award\u2019s estimated fair value at the date of grant and is recognized over the period in which any related services are provided. RSUs are valued based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and are discounted for the lack of dividends, if any, during the vesting period.

Refer to Note 4 for additional information.\nLeases\nOur leases consist primarily of real estate, vehicles and other equipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally utilize our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The lease asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are not recorded for leases with an initial term of one year or less. Lease expense for operating leases recorded in the balance sheet is included in operating costs and expenses and is based on the future minimum lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease plus any variable lease costs. Operating lease expenses, inclusive of short-term and variable lease expenses, recognized in our consolidated statement of income for both the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.1 billion. These amounts do not include lease costs associated with production activities or other amounts capitalized in our consolidated balance sheet, which are not material.\nThe table below summarizes the operating lease assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n(in millions) December 31,\n2020 December 31,\nOther noncurrent assets, net $ 3,784 $ 4,038\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 718 $ 715\nOther noncurrent liabilities $ 3,740 $ 3,891\nThe table below summarizes our future minimum lease commitments for operating leases as of December 31, 2020.\n(in millions) December 31,\n2021 $ 873\n2022 778\n2023 683\n2024 560\n2025 444\nThereafter 2,043\nTotal future minimum lease payments 5,381\nLess: imputed interest 923\nTotal liability $ 4,458\nThe weighted-average remaining lease terms for operating leases and the weighted-average discount rates used to calculate our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were 9 years and 3.58%, respectively, and as of December 31, 2019 were 10 years and 3.74%, respectively.\nIn 2020 and 2019, cash payments for operating leases recorded in the consolidated balance sheet were $936 million and $914 million, respectively. Lease assets and liabilities associated with leases entered into during the year were not material.\nOur 2018 rent expense for operating leases using the accounting guidance in effect at that time was $779 million.\nContractual Obligation\nWe are party to a contractual obligation that involves an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks. The arrangement provides the counterparty with the right to periodic payments associated with current period revenue which are recorded as an operating expense, and beginning in June 2017, the option to require NBCUniversal to purchase the interest for cash in an amount based on a contractual formula. The contractual formula is based on an average of specified historical theme park revenue at the time of exercise, which amount could be significantly higher than our carrying value. As of December 31,\nComcast 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K 100\nComcast Corporation\n2020, our carrying value was $1.1 billion, and the estimated value of the contractual obligation was $1.7 billion based on inputs to the contractual formula as of that date.\nRedeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock\nNBCUniversal Enterprise is a holding company that we control and consolidate whose principal assets are its indirect interests in NBCUniversal. The holders of the Series A cumulative preferred stock of NBCUniversal Enterprise have the right to cause NBCUniversal Enterprise to redeem their shares at a price equal to the $725 million aggregate liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends for a 30 day period beginning March 19, 2020 and thereafter on every third anniversary of such date (each such date, a \u201cput date\u201d). The NBCUniversal Enterprise preferred stock pays dividends at a fixed rate of 5.25% per year. Shares of preferred stock can be called for redemption by NBCUniversal Enterprise at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends one year following the put date applicable to such shares. Because certain of these redemption provisions are outside of our control, the NBCUniversal Enterprise preferred stock is presented outside of equity under the caption \u201credeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock\u201d in our consolidated balance sheet. Its initial value was based on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock and is adjusted for accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock was $731 million and $749 million, respectively. The estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs that use pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
