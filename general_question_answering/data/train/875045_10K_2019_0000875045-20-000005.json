This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2020.\nOther Key Developments\nVUMERITY\nIn October 2019 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved VUMERITY for the treatment of RMS. The FDA approval of VUMERITY was based on a New Drug Application (NDA) submitted under the 505(b)(2) filing pathway. It included interim exposure and safety findings from EVOLVE-MS-1, an ongoing, Phase 3, single-arm, open label, two-year safety study evaluating VUMERITY in patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), and data from pharmacokinetic bridging studies comparing VUMERITY and TECFIDERA to establish bioequivalence, and relied, in part, on the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy for TECFIDERA. In November 2019 VUMERITY became available in the U.S.\nAducanumab (A\u03b2 mAb)\nIn October 2019 we and our collaboration partner Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai) announced that we plan to pursue regulatory approval for aducanumab, our anti-amyloid beta antibody candidate for the potential treatment of AD, in the U.S.\n2019 Share Repurchase Programs\nIn March 2019 our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock (March 2019 Share Repurchase Program).

Our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. All share repurchases under our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program will be retired.\nBoard of Directors Update\nIn June 2019 stockholders elected two new independent directors, William A. Hawkins and Jesus B. Mantas, to Biogen's Board of Directors, who are each serving for a one-year term until the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and their successors are duly elected and qualified.\nManagement Changes\nDuring 2019 we announced the following management changes:\n\u2022\nThe appointment of Alfred Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D. as Executive Vice President, Research and Development; and\n\u2022\nThe appointment of Alphonse Galdes, Ph.D., as Executive Vice President, Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology.\nFor additional information on these and our other executive officers, please read the subsection entitled \"Information about our Executive Officers\" included in this report.\nProduct and Pipeline Developments\nCore Growth Areas\nMultiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology\nTECFIDERA (dimethyl fumarate)\n\u2022\nIn May 2019, at the 71st annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in Philadelphia, PA, we presented re-analyzed pooled images from the Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM studies that showed that treatment with TECFIDERA significantly slowed the rate of whole brain volume loss by 35.9% during the second year of treatment compared to placebo.\n\u2022\nIn September 2019, at the 35th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS) and 24th Annual Conference of Rehabilitation in MS in Stockholm, Sweden, we presented new 10-year results from the ongoing Phase 3 ENDORSE extension study and comparative effectiveness analyses of TECFIDERA that support the consistent, long-term benefits of treatment with TECFIDERA.\nTYSABRI (natalizumab)\n\u2022\nIn January 2019 the first patient was enrolled in the global Phase 3b NOVA study evaluating the efficacy and safety of extended interval dosing (EID; every six weeks) for natalizumab compared to standard interval dosing in patients with RMS.\n\u2022\nIn May 2019, at the 71st annual meeting of the AAN in Philadelphia, PA, we presented updated safety analyses from the TOUCH database safety analysis evaluating EID of natalizumab (of approximately every six weeks) compared to every four-week dosing based on the TOUCH prescribing program database.\n\u2022\nIn September 2019, at the 35th Congress of ECTRIMS and 24th Annual Conference of Rehabilitation in MS in Stockholm, Sweden, we presented new data from the observational, open-label, single-arm STRIVE study that support the real-world long-term effectiveness of TYSABRI in patients with early RMS, who are within three years from diagnosis and are anti-JC virus antibody negative.\nAVONEX (interferon beta-1a) and PLEGRIDY (peginterferon beta-1a)\n\u2022\nIn September 2019, at the 35th Congress of ECTRIMS and 24th Annual Conference of Rehabilitation in MS in Stockholm, Sweden, we presented new data from two real-world observational studies that provide further support that exposure to interferon beta treatment, including AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, before conception and/or during pregnancy is not expected to have an adverse effect on pregnancy or infant growth outcomes.\n\u2022\nIn October 2019 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) updated the summaries of product characteristics for AVONEX and PLEGRIDY to remove pregnancy contraindications and, where clinically needed, to allow use during pregnancy and breastfeeding in women with RMS.\nVUMERITY (diroximel fumarate; DRF)\n\u2022\nIn May 2019, at the 71st annual meeting of the AAN in Philadelphia, PA, we presented updated safety and exploratory efficacy results from the ongoing open-label EVOLVE-MS-1 study of VUMERITY in RMS.\n\u2022\nIn May 2019 we presented new interim data from the EVOLVE-MS-1 study at the annual meeting of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers in Seattle, WA. These data indicated that VUMERITY was generally well tolerated and significantly reduced disease activity in newly diagnosed RMS patients and those previously treated with interferons or glatiramer acetate. Treatment discontinuations due to gastrointestinal events occurred at a low rate over one year.\n\u2022\nIn July 2019 we and Alkermes plc announced positive topline results from EVOLVE-MS-2, a large, randomized, double-blind, five-week, Phase 3 study of VUMERITY for RMS, compared to TECFIDERA. VUMERITY was statistically superior to TECFIDERA on the study's pre-specified primary endpoint, with patients treated with VUMERITY self-reporting significantly fewer days of key gastrointestinal symptoms with intensity scores \u2265 2 on the Individual Gastrointestinal Symptom and Impact Scale, as compared to TECFIDERA (p=0.0003).\n\u2022\nIn September 2019, at the 35th Congress of ECTRIMS and 24th Annual Conference of Rehabilitation in MS in Stockholm, Sweden, we presented interim data from the Phase 3 EVOLVE-MS-1 study that support the potential of VUMERITY as a novel oral fumarate.\n\u2022\nIn November 2019, at the 27th Annual Meeting of the European Charcot Foundation in Italy, we presented results from the Phase 3 EVOLVE-MS-2 study demonstrating the improved patient-assessed gastrointestinal tolerability of VUMERITY compared to TECFIDERA.\nBIIB091 (BTK inhibitor)\n\u2022\nIn May 2019 the first participant was dosed in the Phase 1 study of BIIB091 in MS.\n\u2022\nIn December 2019 dosing began for the final multiple ascending dose cohort in the Phase 1 study of BIIB091 in MS.\nAlzheimer's Disease and Dementia\nAducanumab (A\u03b2 mAb)\n\u2022\nIn March 2019 we and our collaboration partner Eisai announced the decision to discontinue the global Phase 3 trials, ENGAGE and EMERGE, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD and mild AD dementia.\n\u2022\nIn October 2019 we and our collaboration partner Eisai announced that we plan to pursue regulatory approval for aducanumab in the U.S. and that the Phase 3 EMERGE study met its primary endpoint showing a significant reduction in clinical decline. We believe that results from a subset of patients in the Phase 3 ENGAGE study who received sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab support the findings from EMERGE. The decision to file is based on a new analysis, conducted in consultation with the FDA, of a larger dataset from the Phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE trials that were discontinued in March 2019 following a futility analysis.\n\u2022\nIn December 2019, at the 12th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease annual meeting in San Diego, CA, we presented topline results from the Phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE trials of aducanumab.\nBAN2401 (A\u03b2 mAb)\n\u2022\nIn May 2019 our collaboration partner Eisai dosed the first patient in the global Phase 3 study (Clarity AD) of BAN2401 in early AD.\nBIIB092 (gosuranemab)\n\u2022\nIn September 2019 we completed enrollment of the Phase 2 study of gosuranemab for early AD.\nNeuromuscular Disorders\nSPINRAZA (nusinersen)\n\u2022\nIn February 2019 SPINRAZA was approved by the China National Medical Products Association for the treatment of 5q SMA.\n\u2022\nIn April 2019 we presented new data illustrating the rapidly progressive nature of SMA in adults, adolescents and older children. We also presented data from the NURTURE study, highlighting the benefits of pre-symptomatic treatment and findings on the role of neurofilament as a potential biomarker for predicting motor function in SMA. These data were presented at the Muscular Dystrophy Association Clinical and Scientific Conference in Orlando, FL.\n\u2022\nIn April 2019 data from CS2/CS12, an open-label study of the safety and tolerability of SPINRAZA in individuals with later-onset SMA, were published in the peer-reviewed journal Neurology, the medical journal of the AAN. The data showed that individuals with later-onset SMA, treated with SPINRAZA, regained motor function that had been previously lost and that treatment stabilized their disease activity leading to improvements in activities of daily living.\n\u2022\nIn May 2019, at the 71st annual meeting of the AAN in Philadelphia, PA, we presented data from the NURTURE study that demonstrated that pre-symptomatic infants with SMA treated with SPINRAZA over three years achieved motor milestones that are more consistent with normal childhood development, as well as interim results from the ENDEAR/CHERISH/SHINE open-label extension study that showed that treatment with SPINRAZA, particularly when initiated earlier, leads to progressive motor milestone improvements and increased survival rates for individuals with infantile-onset SMA.\n\u2022\nIn May 2019 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the U.K. recommended funding for SPINRAZA on the National Health Service. The positive recommendation is for the treatment of infants, children and adults with 5q SMA, including pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SMA Types 1, 2 and 3.\n\u2022\nIn June and July 2019 we presented new results from the NURTURE study, adding data to the longest study of SMA in pre-symptomatic infants (n=25). The data reported, after up to 45.1 months of analysis, continued to demonstrate efficacy and safety in patients treated pre-symptomatically with SPINRAZA in comparison to the natural history of SMA. These new data also showed that patients treated with SPINRAZA had continuous improvement, with the majority of patients achieving motor milestones within timeframes consistent with normal development. These data were presented at the Cure SMA Annual SMA Conference in Anaheim, CA and the 5th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology in Oslo, Norway.\n\u2022\nIn September 2019 we announced that we plan to initiate DEVOTE, a new Phase 2/3 study evaluating whether a higher dose of SPINRAZA can offer even greater efficacy in treating SMA, as well as the safety and tolerability of SPINRAZA, when administered at a higher dose.\n\u2022\nIn September 2019 we presented new data further demonstrating the safety and efficacy of treatment with SPINRAZA in individuals with later-onset SMA at the 13th Congress of the European Paediatric Neurology Society in Athens, Greece. An integrated analysis from SHINE, an open-label extension study for patients with SMA who participated in prior SPINRAZA studies, found that children with later-onset SMA (Type 2 or Type 3) experienced improvements or stabilization in one or more measures of motor function for up to nearly six years, in contrast to the expected decline observed in natural history cohorts.\n\u2022\nIn October 2019 the journal Neuromuscular Disorders published data from NURTURE, the first study investigating a treatment targeting the underlying cause of SMA in infants treated pre-symptomatically. Data from the NURTURE study demonstrated that infants who initiated treatment with SPINRAZA prior to the onset of clinical symptoms attained unparalleled results compared to the natural history of the disease. These published results from the NURTURE study were previously presented at the 2019 Cure SMA Annual\nSMA Conference in Anaheim, CA and the 5th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology in Oslo, Norway.\nBIIB067 (tofersen) - ALS\n\u2022\nIn March 2019 the first patient was dosed in the Phase 3 VALOR study of tofersen in adults with ALS with a confirmed superdioxide dismutate 1 (SOD1) mutation.\n\u2022\nIn May 2019 we presented interim results of the Phase 1/2 study of tofersen. The data demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SOD1 protein levels and a numerical trend towards slowing of clinical decline in SOD1-ALS patients treated with tofersen compared to placebo. The data were presented at the 71st annual meeting of the AAN in Philadelphia, PA and The European Network for the Cure of ALS meeting in Tours, France.\nBIIB100 (XPO1 inhibitor) - ALS\n\u2022\nIn June 2019 the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1 study of BIIB100 in sporadic ALS.\nMovement Disorders\nBIIB054 (cinpanemab) - Parkinson's Disease\n\u2022\nIn May 2019 we completed enrollment of the Phase 2 study of BIIB054 for Parkinson's disease.\nBIIB094 (ION859) - Parkinson's Disease\n\u2022\nIn August 2019 the first patient in the Phase 1 study of BIIB094, an ASO targeting leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) for Parkinson's disease, was dosed.\nOphthalmology\nBIIB111 (timrepigene emparvovec) - CHM\n\u2022\nIn November 2019 we completed enrollment of the Phase 3 STAR study of timrepigene emparvovec for CHM.\nEmerging Growth Areas\nImmunology\nDapirolizumab Pegol (anti-CD40L) - SLE\n\u2022\nIn June 2019 our collaboration partner UCB presented interim results from the Phase 2b study of dapirolizumab pegol (DZP) in patients with active SLE despite standard-of-care treatment. The primary endpoint of the study, which was to demonstrate a dose response at 24 weeks on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-based Composite Lupus Assessment (p=0.07), was not met. The study did demonstrate consistent and potentially meaningful improvements for the majority of clinical endpoints in patients treated with DZP compared with placebo. In addition, biomarker data demonstrated evidence of proof of biology. DZP was well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. The data were presented at the European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR) 2019 in Madrid, Spain.\nBIIB059 (anti-BDCA2) - CLE/SLE\n\u2022\nIn May 2019 we completed enrollment of the Phase 2 LILAC study of BIIB059 for CLE and SLE.\n\u2022\nIn December 2019 we announced positive top-line results from the Phase 2 LILAC study evaluating the efficacy and safety of BIIB059 in CLE and SLE. The CLE part of the study met its primary endpoint (p<0.001) by demonstrating a dose response of BIIB059 on the percent change from baseline in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index Activity (CLASI-A) score at week 16 in individuals with CLE. Study participants with CLE treated with 50 mg, 150 mg and 450 mg of BIIB059 experienced reductions in CLASI-A scores of 40.9% (p=0.008), 48.0% (p=0.001) and 42.5% (p=0.001), respectively, versus 14.5% with placebo. CLASI-A is a well-defined and reliable outcome measure that has been shown to detect meaningful change in CLE skin disease activity.\nThe SLE part of the study also met its primary endpoint of reducing disease activity in individuals with SLE as measured by change from baseline in total active joint count at week 24 (treatment difference = -3.4 for BIIB059 450 mg versus placebo, p=0.037). Total active joint count is the total number of tender or swollen\njoints, with joint involvement being a common symptom in people with SLE. In addition, improvements in skin disease and overall disease activity were consistently observed across multiple secondary endpoints.\nNeurocognitive Disorders\nBIIB104 (AMPA) - CIAS\n\u2022\nIn June 2019 the FDA granted BIIB104 fast track designation for CIAS.\nAcute Neurology\nBIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) - Brain Contusion\n\u2022\nIn October 2019 we dosed the first patient in the Phase 2 study of BIIB093 for brain contusion.\nBiosimilars\nSamsung Bioepis - Biogen's Joint Venture with Samsung BioLogics\n\u2022\nIn June 2019 we presented real-world evidence confirming the safety and efficacy of BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI and the high adherence of patients to treatment. The data were presented at EULAR 2019 in Madrid, Spain.\n\u2022\nIn October 2019 we presented new data highlighting real-world evidence confirming the safety and efficacy of IMRALDI and FLIXABI for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These data were presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week 2019 in Barcelona, Spain.\nGenentech Relationship\nAnti-CD20 Therapies\nGAZYVA (obinutuzumab)\n\u2022\nIn June 2019 Roche announced positive topline results for NOBILITY, a Phase 2 study investigating the safety and efficacy of GAZYVA for adults with proliferative lupus nephritis. The study met its primary endpoint, showing GAZYVA, in combination with standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid and corticosteroids), demonstrated enhanced efficacy compared to placebo plus standard of care alone in achieving complete renal response at one year. In addition, GAZYVA met key secondary endpoints showing improved overall renal responses (complete and partial renal response) and serologic markers of disease activity as compared to placebo.\n\u2022\nIn September 2019 Roche announced that the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to GAZYVA for adults with lupus nephritis. This designation was granted based on data from the Phase 2 NOBILITY study in adult patients with proliferative lupus nephritis, as discussed above.\nDiscontinued Programs\n\u2022\nIn August 2019 we discontinued the Phase 2b study of BG00011 (STX-100) for the potential treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) due to safety concerns.\n\u2022\nIn September 2019 we and our collaboration partner Eisai announced the decision to discontinue the global Phase 3 studies (MISSION AD1 and MISSION AD2) of the investigational oral BACE (beta amyloid cleaving enzyme) inhibitor elenbecestat (development code: E2609) in patients with early AD.\n\u2022\nIn December 2019 we announced that the Phase 2 PASSPORT study investigating gosuranemab in individuals with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) did not meet its primary endpoint. Based on these results, we discontinued development of gosuranemab in PSP and other primary tauopathies. Safety results of the Phase 2 PASSPORT study were generally consistent with previous studies of gosuranemab. We will continue our ongoing Phase 2 TANGO study of gosuranemab for mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD, given differences in disease pathology.\nMarketed Products\nThe following graph shows our revenues by product and revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n(1)\nInterferon includes product revenues from AVONEX and PLEGRIDY.\n(2)\nFor 2019, 2018 and 2017 other includes product revenues from FAMPYRA, FUMADERM, BENEPALI and FLIXABI.

A discussion of the risks attendant to our operations is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.\nMultiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology\nWe develop, manufacture and market a number of products designed to treat patients with MS. MS is a progressive neurological disease in which the body loses the ability to transmit messages along nerve cells, leading to a loss of muscle control, paralysis and, in some cases, death. Patients with active RMS experience an uneven pattern of disease progression characterized by periods of stability that are interrupted by flare-ups of the disease after which the patient returns to a new baseline of functioning.\nOur MS products and major markets are as follows:\nProduct\nIndication\nCollaborator\nMajor Markets\nRMS in the U.S.\nRRMS in the E.U.\nNone\nU.S.\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nJapan\nSpain\nU.K.\nRMS\nNone\nU.S.\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nJapan\nSpain\nRMS in the U.S.\nRRMS in the E.U.\nNone\nU.S.\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nSpain\nU.K.\nRMS\nRRMS in the E.U.\nCrohn's disease in the U.S.\nNone\nU.S.\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nSpain\nU.K.\nRMS in the U.S.\nAlkermes Pharma Ireland Limited, a subsidiary of Alkermes plc (Alkermes)\nU.S.\nWalking ability for patients with MS\nAcorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Acorda)\nFrance\nGermany\nNeuromuscular Disorders\nSMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing. Due to a deletion or mutations in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical to the survival of the neurons that control muscles. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support, and typically do not live beyond two years of age without respiratory support and nutritional interventions. People with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering, forms of SMA.\nOur SMA product and major markets are as follows:\nProduct\nIndication\nCollaborator\nMajor Markets\nSMA\nIonis\nU.S.\nBrazil\nCanada\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nJapan\nSpain\nTurkey\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Ionis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nBiosimilars\nBiosimilars are a group of biologic medicines that are similar to currently available biologic therapies known as originators.

The insights gained from these engagements help us support patients with services, programs and applications that are designed to help patients lead better lives. Among other things, we provide customer service and other related programs for our products, such as disease and product specific websites, insurance research services, financial assistance programs and the facilitation of the procurement of our marketed products.\nWe are dedicated to helping patients obtain access to our therapies. Our patient representatives have access to a suite of financial assistance tools. With those tools, we help patients understand their insurance coverage and, if needed, help patients compare and select new insurance options and programs. In the U.S., we have established programs that provide co-pay assistance or free marketed product for qualified uninsured or underinsured patients, based on specific eligibility criteria. We also provide charitable contributions to independent charitable organizations that assist patients with out-of-pocket expenses associated with their therapy.\nMarketing and Distribution\nSales Force and Marketing\nWe promote our products worldwide, including in the U.S., most of the major countries of the E.U. and Japan, primarily through our own sales forces and marketing groups. In some countries, particularly in areas where we continue to expand into new geographic areas, we partner with third parties.\nWe and Eisai co-promote AVONEX, TYSABRI and TECFIDERA in Japan in certain settings.\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA and OCREVUS are marketed by the Roche Group and its sublicensees.\nWe commercialize BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in collaboration with Samsung Bioepis in certain countries in Europe.\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on specialist physicians in private practice or at major medical centers. We use customary industry practices to market our products and to educate physicians, such as sales representatives calling on individual physicians, advertisements, professional symposia, direct mail, public relations and other methods.\nDistribution Arrangements\nWe distribute our products in the U.S. principally through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products, mail order specialty distributors or shipping service providers. In other countries, the distribution of our products varies from country to country, including through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products and third-party distribution partners who are responsible for most marketing and distribution activities.\nEisai distributes AVONEX, TYSABRI, TECFIDERA and PLEGRIDY in India and other Asia-Pacific markets, excluding China.\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA and OCREVUS are distributed by the Roche Group and its sublicensees.\nWe distribute BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in certain countries in Europe and have exclusive rights to distribute these products in China.\nOur product sales to two wholesale distributors, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson, each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 47%, 50% and 56% of our gross product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For additional information, please read Note 4, Revenues, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nPatents and Other Proprietary Rights\nPatents are important to obtaining and protecting exclusive rights in our products and product candidates. We regularly seek patent protection in the U.S. and in selected countries outside the U.S. for inventions originating from our research and development efforts. In addition, we license rights to various patents and patent applications.\nU.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest application was filed; however, U.S. patents that issue on applications filed before June 8, 1995, may be effective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20-year date. In some cases, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic or, in the case of the U.S., because of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delays in prosecuting the application. Specifically, in the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers a drug approved by the FDA may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to 5 years, but not beyond a total of\n14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The duration and extension of the term of foreign patents varies, in accordance with local law. For example, supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) on some of our products have been granted in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\nRegulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, also can provide meaningful protection for our products. Regulatory data protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization, for a set period of time, the exclusive use of the proprietary pre-clinical and clinical data that it created at significant cost and submitted to the applicable regulatory authority to obtain approval of its product. After the applicable set period of time, third parties are then permitted to rely upon such data to file for approval of their abbreviated applications for, and to market (subject to any applicable market protection), their generic drugs and biosimilars referencing such data. Market protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization the exclusive right to commercialize its product for a set period of time, thereby preventing the commercialization of another product containing the same active ingredient(s) during that period. Although the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) requires signatory countries to provide regulatory exclusivity to innovative pharmaceutical products, implementation and enforcement varies widely from country to country.\nWe also rely upon other forms of unpatented confidential information to remain competitive. We protect such information principally through\nconfidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers. In the case of our employees, these agreements also provide, in compliance with relevant law, that inventions and other intellectual property conceived by such employees during their employment shall be our exclusive property.\nOur trademarks are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or registrations in the USPTO and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. We also use trademarks licensed from third parties, such as the trademark FAMPYRA, which we license from Acorda. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms.\nOur Patent Portfolio\nThe following table describes our patents in the U.S. and Europe that we currently consider of primary importance to our marketed products, including the territory, patent number, general subject matter and expected expiration dates. Except as otherwise noted, the expected expiration dates include any granted patent term extensions and issued SPCs. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to, among other things, particular forms or compositions, methods of manufacturing or use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. We also continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the U.S. and other territories covering various aspects of our products that may, if issued, extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the patents listed in the table.\nProduct\nTerritory\nPatent No.\nGeneral Subject Matter\nPatent\nExpiration(1)\nTECFIDERA\nU.S.\n7,619,001\nMethods of treatment\nU.S.\n8,399,514\nMethods of treatment\n2028(2)\nEurope\nFormulations of dialkyl fumarates and their use for treating autoimmune diseases\n2024(3)\nEurope\nMethods of use\n2028(4)\nAVONEX and PLEGRIDY\nU.S.\n7,588,755\nUse of recombinant beta interferon for immunomodulation\nPLEGRIDY\nU.S.\n7,446,173\nPolymer conjugates of interferon beta-1a\nU.S.\n8,524,660\nMethods of treatment\nU.S.\n8,017,733\nPolymer conjugates of interferon beta-1a\nEurope\nPolymer conjugates of interferon-beta-1a and uses thereof\n2024(5)\nEurope\nPolymer conjugates of interferon-beta-1a and uses thereof\n2023(6)\nTYSABRI\nU.S.\n6,602,503\nHumanized recombinant antibodies; nucleic acids and host cells; processes for production; therapeutic compositions; methods of use\nU.S.\n7,807,167\nMethods of treatment\nU.S.\n9,493,567\nMethods of treatment\nEurope\nHumanized immunoglobulins; nucleic acids; pharmaceutical compositions; medical uses\n2020(7)\nEurope\nMethods of use\nEurope\nMethods of use\nFAMPYRA\nEurope\nSustained-release aminopyridine compositions for increasing walking speed in patients with MS\n2025(8)\nEurope\nSustained-release aminopyridine compositions for treating MS\n2025(9)\nVUMERITY\nU.S.\n8,669,281\nCompounds and pharmaceutical compositions\nU.S.\n9,090,558\nMethods of treatment\nU.S.\n10,080,733\nCrystalline forms, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment\nSPINRAZA\nU.S.\n7,101,993\nOligonucleotides containing 2\u2019-O-modified purines\nU.S.\n7,838,657\nSMA treatment via targeting of SMN2 splice site inhibitory sequences\nU.S.\n8,110,560\nSMA treatment via targeting of SMN2 splice site inhibitory sequences\nU.S.\n8,361,977\nCompositions and methods for modulation of SMN2 splicing\nU.S.\n8,980,853\nCompositions and methods for modulation of SMN2 splicing\nU.S.\n9,717,750\nCompositions and methods for modulation of SMN2 splicing\nU.S.\n9,926,559\nCompositions and methods for modulation of SMN2 splicing\nU.S.\n10,266,822\nSMA treatment via targeting of SMN2 splice site inhibitory sequences\nU.S.\n10,436,802\nMethods for Treating Spinal Muscular Atrophy\nEurope\nCompositions and methods for modulation of SMN2 splicing\n2026(10)\nEurope\nCompositions and methods for modulation of SMN2 splicing\n2026(11)\nEurope\nCompositions and methods for modulation of SMN2 splicing\nEurope\nCompositions and methods for modulation of SMN2 splicing\nFootnotes follow on next page.\n(1)\nIn addition to patent protection, certain of our products are entitled to regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. and the E.U. expected until the dates set forth below:\nProduct\nTerritory\nExpected Expiration\nTECFIDERA\nE.U.\nPLEGRIDY\nU.S.\nE.U.\nFAMPYRA\nE.U.\nSPINRAZA\nU.S.\nE.U.\n(2)\nFor additional information, please read Note 20, Litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n(3)\nThis patent is subject to granted SPCs in certain European countries, which extended the patent term in those countries to 2024.\n(4)\nThis patent was revoked in a European opposition.

Patents relating to pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes, such as those that cover our existing products, compounds and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We also face challenges to our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights covering our products by manufacturers of generics, biosimilars, prodrugs and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report, and a discussion of legal proceedings related to certain patents described above is set forth in Note 20, Litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and comes from many sources, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors, certain of whom have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do, are working to develop or have commercialized products similar to or competitive with those we market or are developing and have considerable experience in undertaking clinical trials and in obtaining regulatory approval to market pharmaceutical products. In addition, the commercialization of certain of our own approved products, products of our collaborators and pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of our existing products.\nWe believe that competition and leadership in the industry is based on managerial and technological excellence and innovation as well as establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to maximize the approval, acceptance and use of products resulting from research and the availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive within the industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientists and technicians. We believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining skilled and experienced scientific personnel.\nCompetition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, convenience/delivery devices, reliability, availability and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have a significant impact on our competitive position.\nThe introduction of new products or technologies, including the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products or technologies, results in increased competition for our marketed products and pricing pressure on our marketed products. The development of new or improved treatment options or standards of care or cures for the diseases our products treat reduces and could eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates.\nWe also face increased competitive pressures from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products as well as products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products, which may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell. In addition, when a generic version of one of our products is commercialized, it may, in some cases, be automatically substituted for our product and reduce our revenues in a short period of time.\nAdditional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below.\nMultiple Sclerosis\nTECFIDERA, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI and VUMERITY each compete with one or more of the following products as well as generic and biosimilar versions of such products:\nCompeting Product\nCompetitor\nAUBAGIO (teriflunomide)\nSanofi Genzyme\nBETASERON/BETAFERON (interferon-beta-1b)\nBayer Group\nCOPAXONE\n(glatiramer acetate)\nTeva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.\nEXTAVIA\n(interferon-beta-1b)\nNovartis AG\nGILENYA (fingolimod)\nNovartis AG\nGLATOPA (glatiramer acetate)\nSandoz, a division of Novartis AG\nLEMTRADA (alemtuzumab)\nSanofi Genzyme\nMAVENCLAD (cladribine)\nEMD Serono\nMAYZENT (siponimod)\nNovartis AG\nOCREVUS (ocrelizumab)\nGenentech\nREBIF\n(interferon-beta-1)\nEMD Serono\nFAMPYRA is indicated as a treatment to improve walking in adult patients with MS who have a walking disability and is the first treatment that addresses this unmet medical need with demonstrated efficacy in people with all types of MS. FAMPYRA is currently the only therapy approved to improve walking in patients with MS.\nCompetition in the MS market is intense. Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop additional treatments for MS that may in the future compete with our MS products. One such product that was approved in the U.S. in 2017 and in the E.U. in 2018 is OCREVUS, a treatment for RMS and PPMS that was developed by Genentech. While we have a financial interest in OCREVUS, future sales of our MS products may be adversely affected if\nOCREVUS continues to gain market share, or if other MS products that we or our competitors are developing are commercialized. Future sales may also be negatively impacted by the introduction of generics, prodrugs of existing therapies, biosimilars of existing products or products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways.\nSpinal Muscular Atrophy\nWe face competition from a new gene therapy product that was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 for the treatment of SMA. Additionally, we are aware of other products in development that, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with SPINRAZA in the SMA market, including potential oral products. Future sales of SPINRAZA may be adversely affected by the commercialization of competing products.\nPsoriasis\nFUMADERM competes with several different types of therapies in the psoriasis market within Germany, including oral systemics such as methotrexate and cyclosporine.\nBiosimilars\nBENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI, the three biosimilar products we currently commercialize in certain countries in Europe for Samsung Bioepis, compete with their reference products, ENBREL, HUMIRA and REMICADE, respectively, as well as other biosimilars of those reference products.\nGenentech Relationships in Other Indications\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA in Oncology\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA compete with a number of therapies in the oncology market, including TREANDA (bendamustine HCL), ARZERRA (ofatumumab), IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) and ZYDELIG (idelalisib).\nWe also expect that over time RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA will increasingly compete with RITUXAN in the oncology market. In addition, we are aware of anti-CD20 molecules, including biosimilar products, in development that if successfully developed and approved, could compete with RITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA in the oncology market. The introduction of a biosimilar product can result in a significant reduction in net sales for the relevant product, as other manufacturers typically offer their versions at lower prices. In November 2019 and January 2020 biosimilar products referencing\nRITUXAN were launched in the U.S. and this could adversely affect the pre-tax profits of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, which could, in turn adversely affect our co-promotion profits in the U.S. in future years.\nRITUXAN in Rheumatoid Arthritis\nRITUXAN competes with several different types of therapies in the rheumatoid arthritis market, including, among others, traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as steroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine, TNF inhibitors, ORENCIA (abatacept), ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) and XELJANZ (tofacitinib).\nWe are also aware of other products, including biosimilars, in development that, if approved, may compete with RITUXAN in the rheumatoid arthritis market.\nResearch and Development Programs\nA commitment to research is fundamental to our mission. Our research efforts are focused on better understanding the underlying biology of diseases so we can discover and deliver treatments that have the potential to make a real difference in the lives of patients with high unmet medical needs. By applying our expertise in biologics and our growing capabilities in small molecule, antisense, gene therapy, gene editing and other technologies, we target specific medical needs where we believe new or better treatments are needed.\nWe intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where a drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and technologies and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels.\nFor additional information on our research and development expense included in our consolidated statements of income, please read Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report.\nThe table below highlights our current research and development programs that are in clinical trials and the current phase of such programs. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.\n* Collaboration program\n# Option agreement\n^ Large Hemispheric Infarction (LHI)\nFor information about certain of our agreements with collaborators and other third parties, please read the subsection entitled Business Relationships below and Note 2, Acquisitions, Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, and Note 19, Investments in Variable Interest Entities, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nBusiness Relationships\nAs part of our business strategy, we establish business relationships, including entering into licenses, joint ventures and collaborative arrangements with other companies, universities and medical research institutions, to assist in the clinical development and/or commercialization of certain of our products and product candidates and to provide support for our research programs.

(Roche Group)\nWe have collaboration arrangements with Genentech which entitle us to certain business and financial rights with respect to RITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA, OCREVUS and other potential anti-CD20 therapies.\nIonis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nWe have an exclusive, worldwide option and collaboration agreement with Ionis relating to the development and commercialization of antisense therapeutics for up to three gene targets. Under a separate collaboration and license agreement with Ionis, we have an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA. We also have a 10-year exclusive collaboration agreement with Ionis to develop novel ASO drug candidates for a broad range of neurological diseases, which we refer to as the 2018 Ionis Agreement.\nIn addition, we have research collaboration agreements with Ionis under which both companies perform discovery level research and will develop and commercialize new ASO drug candidates for the potential treatment of SMA and additional antisense or other therapeutics for the potential treatment of neurological diseases.\nNeurimmune SubOne AG\nWe have a collaboration and license agreement with Neurimmune SubOne AG (Neurimmune) for the development and commercialization of antibodies for the potential treatment of AD, including aducanumab (as amended, the Neurimmune Agreement). We are responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of all licensed products.\nSamsung Bioepis Co., Ltd.\nWe and Samsung BioLogics established a joint venture, Samsung Bioepis, to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar products. We also have an agreement with Samsung Bioepis to commercialize, over a 10-year term, 3 anti-TNF biosimilar product candidates in Europe and, in the case of BENEPALI, Japan. Under this agreement, we are commercializing BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL, IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA, and FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, in certain countries in Europe.\nIn December 2019 we completed a transaction with Samsung Bioepis and secured the exclusive rights to commercialize two potential ophthalmology biosimilar products, SB11 referencing LUCENTIS and SB15 referencing EYLEA, in major markets worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia. We also acquired an option to extend our existing commercial agreement with Samsung Bioepis for BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in Europe and obtained exclusive rights to commercialize these products in China.\nIn addition to our joint venture and commercialization agreements with Samsung Bioepis, we license certain of our proprietary technology to Samsung Bioepis in connection with Samsung Bioepis' development, manufacture and commercialization of its biosimilar products. We also provide technical development and technology transfer services to Samsung Bioepis.\nSkyhawk Therapeutics, Inc.\nWe have a collaboration and research and development services agreement with Skyhawk pursuant to which the companies are leveraging Skyhawk\u2019s SkySTAR technology platform with the goal of discovering innovative small molecule treatments for patients with neurological diseases, including MS and SMA. We are responsible for the development and potential commercialization of any therapies resulting from this collaboration.\nTMS Co., Ltd.\nWe have an exclusive option agreement with TMS Co., Ltd. (TMS) granting us the option to acquire TMS-007, a plasminogen activator with a novel mechanism of action associated with breaking down blood clots which is in Phase 2 development in Japan, and backup compounds for the treatment of stroke.\nRegulatory\nOur current and contemplated activities and the products, technologies and processes that result from\nsuch activities are subject to substantial government regulation.\nRegulation of Pharmaceuticals\nProduct Approval and Post-Approval Regulation in the U.S.\nAPPROVAL PROCESS\nBefore new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA requires companies to register both pre-approval and post-approval clinical trials and disclose clinical trial results in public databases. Failure to register a trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties. Clinical trial programs must establish efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and dosing regimen and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application (BLA) or a NDA. In response to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval.\nProduct development and receipt of regulatory approval takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of suitable alternative treatments, potential safety signals observed in preclinical or clinical tests and the risks and benefits of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. The agency may require the sponsor of a BLA or NDA to conduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may lead to unanticipated delays or expenses. Furthermore, even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA's interpretation of the existing pre-clinical and/or clinical data.\nThe FDA has developed four distinct approaches intended to facilitate the development and expedite the regulatory review of therapeutically important drugs, especially when the drugs are the first available treatment or have advantages over existing\ntreatments: accelerated approval, fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review.\n\u2022\nAccelerated Approval: The FDA may grant \u201caccelerated approval\u201d to products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under this pathway, the FDA may approve a product based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to provide the FDA with confirmatory data post-approval to verify and describe clinical benefit. Under the FDA's accelerated approval regulations, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require certain post-marketing restrictions to assure safe use. In addition, for products approved under accelerated approval, sponsors may be required to submit all copies of their promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at least 30 days prior to initial dissemination. The FDA may withdraw approval if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to verify clinical benefit, it becomes clear that restrictions on the distribution of the product are inadequate to ensure its safe use or if a sponsor fails to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval.\n\u2022\nFast Track: The FDA may grant \"fast track\" status to products that treat a serious condition and have data demonstrating the potential to address an unmet medical need or a drug that has been designated as a qualified infectious disease product.\n\u2022\nBreakthrough Therapy: The FDA may grant \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d status to drugs designed to treat, alone or in combination with another drug or drugs, a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence suggests a substantial improvement over existing therapies based on a clinically significant endpoint. Breakthrough therapy status entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent meetings with the FDA regarding the development of nonclinical and clinical data and permits the FDA to offer product development or regulatory advice for the purpose of shortening the time to product approval. Breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee that a product will be eligible for priority review and does not ensure FDA approval.\n\u2022\nPriority Review: \u201cPriority review\u201d only applies to applications (original or efficacy supplement) for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review may also be granted for any supplement that proposes a labeling change due to studies completed in response to a written request from the FDA for pediatric studies, for an application for a drug that has been designated as a qualified infectious disease product or for any application or supplement for a drug submitted with a priority review voucher.\nIn December 2016 the FDA issued a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher to us in connection with the approval of SPINRAZA.\nPOST-MARKETING STUDIES\nRegardless of the approval pathway employed, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional post-marketing studies as a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. If a sponsor fails to conduct the required studies, the FDA may withdraw its approval. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it can mandate post-marketing restrictions to assure safe use. In such a case, the sponsor may be required to establish rigorous systems to assure use of the product under safe conditions. These systems are usually referred to as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). The FDA can impose financial penalties for failing to comply with certain post-marketing commitments, including REMS. In addition, any changes to an approved REMS must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to implementation.\nADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\nWe monitor information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval and report such information and events to regulatory agencies. Non-compliance with the FDA's safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a new REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS, require new post-marketing studies (including additional clinical trials) or suspend or withdraw approval of the product. These requirements may affect our ability to maintain marketing approval of our products or require us to\nmake significant expenditures to obtain or maintain such approvals.\nAPPROVAL OF CHANGES TO AN APPROVED PRODUCT\nIf we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, such as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing changes or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, the FDA will need to review and approve such changes in advance. In the case of a new indication, we are required to demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for a use other than what was initially approved. FDA regulatory review may result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.\nREGULATION OF PRODUCT ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION\nThe FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities and communications for products under its jurisdiction both before and after approval. Pursuant to FDA guidance, a company can make safety and efficacy claims from data either in or consistent with the label. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling. Such off-label prescribing is common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the government.\nRegulation of Combination Products\nCombination products are defined by the FDA to include products comprising two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and a device). Biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. Some of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and similar regulations outside the U.S., and we expect that some of our pipeline product candidates may be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well.\nIn May 2017 new regulations governing medical devices (MDR) and in-vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR) entered into force in the E.U. although these\nare not expected to fully apply until May 2020 with respect to the MDR regulations and May 2022 with respect to the IVDR regulations. All products covered by these regulations will be required to comply with them at the end of the transitional periods. These regulations introduce new requirements, including for clinical investigation of certain classifications of medical devices, require increased regulatory scrutiny, enhance the requirements for post market surveillance and vigilance and provide for greater transparency. These regulations also change the requirements for assessment of the medical device components of integral drug-device combination products, necessitating assessment of the device components under both the medical device and medicinal product regulatory regimes.\nProduct Approval and Post-Approval Regulation Outside the U.S.\nWe market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In Europe, for example, where a substantial part of our ex-U.S. efforts are focused, there are several routes for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing authorization application is similar to the NDA or BLA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the expert scientific committee of the EMA responsible for human medicines. If the CHMP determines that the marketing authorization application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy and that the medicine has a positive benefit risk balance, it will adopt a positive opinion recommending the granting of the marketing authorization by the European Commission (EC). The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing authorization application approved by the EC is valid in all member states of the E.U. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products and new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available for certain other products, including those which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation.\nIn addition to the centralized procedure, the European regulatory framework includes the following options for regulatory review and approval in E.U. member states:\n\u2022\na national procedure, where the first application is made to the competent authority in one E.U. country only;\n\u2022\na decentralized procedure, where applicants submit identical applications to several E.U. countries and receive simultaneous approval, if the medicine has not yet been authorized in any E.U. country; and\n\u2022\na mutual recognition procedure, where applicants that have a medicine authorized in one E.U. country can apply for mutual recognition of this authorization in other E.U. countries.\nAs in the U.S., the E.U. also has distinct approaches intended to optimize the regulatory pathways for therapeutically important drugs, including the Priority Medicines Evaluation Scheme (PRIME), accelerated assessment and conditional marketing authorization. PRIME is intended to provide additional support to medicine developers throughout the development process. Regulatory review timelines in the E.U. may be truncated under accelerated assessment for products that address an unmet medical need. In addition, conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for such products in the interest of public health, where the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk of less comprehensive data than normally required. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. The marketing authorization holder is required to complete specific obligations (ongoing or new studies and, in some cases, additional activities) with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming that the benefit risk balance is positive. Once comprehensive data on the product have been obtained, the marketing authorization may be converted into a standard marketing authorization.\nAside from the U.S. and E.U., there are countries in other regions where it is possible to receive an \"accelerated\" review whereby the national regulatory authority will commit to truncated review timelines for products that meet specific medical needs.\nIn the E.U. there is detailed legislation on pharmacovigilance and extensive guidance on good pharmacovigilance practices. A failure to comply with E.U. pharmacovigilance obligations may result in significant financial penalties for the marketing authorization holder.\nRegardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national competent authorities, the EMA, the EC and the marketing authorization holder. The EMA\u2019s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee is responsible for assessing and monitoring the safety of human medicines and makes recommendations on product safety issues. Marketing authorization holders have\nan obligation to inform regulatory agencies of any new information which may influence the evaluation of benefits and risks of the medicinal product concerned.\nIn the U.S., E.U. and other jurisdictions, regulatory agencies, including the FDA, conduct periodic inspections of NDA and BLA holders to assess their compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations.\nGood Manufacturing Practices\nRegulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and product-specific regulations enforced by regulatory agencies following product approval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions or remedies against us, including significant financial penalties and the suspension of our manufacturing operations.\nGood Clinical Practices\nThe FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the rights and welfare of trial participants are adequately protected (commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP)). Regulatory agencies enforce cGCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites, contract research organizations (CROs) and institutional review boards. If our studies fail to comply with applicable cGCP guidelines, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil or criminal sanctions. We rely on third parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trial-related activities. Failure of such third parties to comply with cGCP can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions.\nIn April 2014 the EC adopted a new Clinical Trial Regulation, which was effective in June 2014 but is not expected to apply until 2021. The regulation harmonizes the procedures for assessment and governance of clinical trials throughout the E.U. and will require that information on the authorization, conduct and results of each clinical trial conducted in the E.U. be publicly available.\nApproval of Biosimilars\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) amended the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to authorize the FDA to approve biological products, referred to as biosimilars or follow-on biologics, that are shown to be \"highly similar\" to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. The biosimilar must show it has no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness from the reference product, and only minor differences in clinically inactive components are allowable in biosimilar products. The approval pathway for biosimilars does, however, grant a biologics manufacturer a 12-year period of exclusivity from the date of approval of its biological product before biosimilar competition can be introduced. There is uncertainty, however, as the approval framework for biosimilars originally was enacted as part of the PPACA. There have been, and there are likely to continue to be, federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. If the PPACA is repealed, substantially modified or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.\nA biosimilars approval pathway has been in place in the E.U. since 2003. The EMA has issued a number of scientific and product specific biosimilar guidelines, including requirements for approving biosimilars containing monoclonal antibodies. In the E.U., biosimilars are generally approved under the centralized procedure. The approval pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on reliance on the clinical trial data of an innovator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated, through comprehensive comparability studies, to be \u201csimilar.\u201d In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full complement of clinical trials typically required for novel biologic drugs.\nOrphan Drug Act\nUnder the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a \u201crare disease or condition,\u201d which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently\nreceives an initial FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Legislation similar to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries to encourage the research, development and marketing of medicines to treat, prevent or diagnose rare diseases. In the E.U., medicinal products that receive and maintain an orphan designation are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity following approval, protocol assistance and access to the centralized procedure for marketing authorization. SPINRAZA has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S., E.U. and Japan.\nRegulation Pertaining to Pricing and Reimbursement\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments, private health plans and other organizations. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the pricing and reimbursement of our products, and drug prices continue to receive significant scrutiny. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and pricing of our products to control cost or affect utilization of our products. Challenges to our pricing strategies, by either government or private stakeholders, could harm our business. The U.S. and foreign governments have enacted and regularly consider additional reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Other payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities and private health insurers, seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, may impose restrictions on access, coverage or pricing of particular drugs based on perceived value.\nWithin the U.S.\n\u2022\nMedicaid: Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate is established by law and is adjusted upward if the average manufacturer price (AMP) increases more than inflation\n(measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). The rebate amount is calculated each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are complex. We are required to report any revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program provides for civil monetary penalties.\n\u2022\nMedicare: Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government. The program covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians or other health care practitioners, are provided in connection with certain durable medical equipment or are certain oral anti-cancer drugs and certain oral immunosuppressive drugs. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (ASP) of the drugs. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide ASP information to the CMS on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer-submitted information is used to calculate Medicare payment rates. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.\nMedicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that are not administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government. Each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and pharmacies, and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. In addition, manufacturers, including us, are required to provide to the CMS a discount of up to 70% on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.\n\u2022\nFederal Agency Discounted Pricing: Our products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal\nSupply Schedule (FSS). FSS participation is required for our products to be covered and reimbursed by the Veterans Administration (VA), Department of Defense, Coast Guard and Public Health Service (PHS). Coverage under Medicaid, Medicare and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the VA, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.\n\u2022\n340B Discounted Pricing: To maintain coverage of our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, we are required to extend significant discounts to certain covered entities that purchase products under Section 340B of the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive certain types of grants under the PHSA. For all of our products, we must agree to charge a price that will not exceed the amount determined under statute (the \u201cceiling price\u201d) when we sell outpatient drugs to these covered entities. In addition, we may, but are not required to, offer these covered entities a price lower than the 340B ceiling price. The 340B discount formula is based on AMP and is generally similar to the level of rebates calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.\nOutside the U.S.\nOutside the U.S., our products are paid for by a variety of payors, with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence reimbursement of products and may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using\nthose reference prices to set a price). Budgetary pressures in many countries are continuing to cause governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates and expanded generic substitution and patient cost-sharing.\nRegulation Pertaining to Sales and Marketing\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care \u201cfraud and abuse,\u201d including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In the U.S., federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal civil False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.\nLaws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include federal \u201csunshine\u201d provisions. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require\ndisclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.\nOther Regulations\nForeign Anti-Corruption\nWe are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.\nThe laws to which we are subject also include the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act), which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the U.K. generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include significant fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.\nNIH Guidelines\nWe seek to conduct research at our U.S. facilities in compliance with the current U.S. National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). By local ordinance, we are required to, among other things, comply with the NIH Guidelines in relation to our facilities in Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC and are required to operate pursuant to certain permits.\nOther Laws\nOur present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and\nregulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to data privacy and protection, safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject to national or international antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.\nThe European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation (GDPR) in 2016 to replace the current E.U. Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR took effect in May 2018 and governs the collection and use of personal data in the E.U. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.U. to the U.S., provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20.0 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe strive to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning the environment. While it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our operations or competitive position.\nManufacturing\nWe are committed to ensuring an uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients around the world. To that end, we continually review our manufacturing capacity, capabilities, processes and facilities. We believe that our manufacturing facilities, together with the third-party contract manufacturing organizations we outsource to, currently provide sufficient capacity\nfor our products and to Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture that develops, manufactures and markets biosimilar products, and other strategic contract manufacturing partners. In order to support our drug development pipeline, we are expanding our large molecule production capacity by building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland. We expect this facility to be partially operational by the end of 2020.\nManufacturing Facilities\nOur drug substance manufacturing facility includes:\nFacility\nDrug Substance Manufactured\nRTP, NC\nAVONEX\nPLEGRIDY\nTYSABRI\nOther*\n* Other includes products manufactured for contract manufacturing partners.\nIn addition to our drug substance manufacturing facility, we have a drug product manufacturing facility and supporting infrastructure in RTP, NC, including a parenteral facility and an oral solid dose products manufacturing facility.\nThe parenteral facility adds capabilities and capacity for filling biologics into vials and is principally used for filling product candidates. The oral solid dose products facility can supplement our outsourced small molecule manufacturing capabilities, including the manufacture of TECFIDERA.\nWe also have an oligonucleotide synthesis manufacturing facility in RTP, NC. This facility gives us the capability to manufacture ASO drugs like SPINRAZA as well as our other ASO candidates currently in our clinical pipeline.\nIn order to support our drug development pipeline, we are building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland, which we expect to be partially operational by the end of 2020.\nGenentech is responsible for all worldwide manufacturing activities for bulk RITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA and has sourced the manufacture of certain bulk RITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA requirements to a third party. Acorda supplies FAMPYRA to us pursuant to its supply agreement with Alkermes, Inc. and Ionis supplies the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for SPINRAZA. Alkermes currently supplies VUMERITY to us pursuant to our supply agreement with Alkermes. In October 2019 we entered into a new supply agreement and amended our license and collaboration agreement with Alkermes pursuant to which we have the election,\nfollowing a transition period, to manufacture VUMERITY or have manufacturing transitioned to a third party.\nThird-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers\nWe principally use third parties to manufacture the API and the final product for our small molecule products and product candidates, including TECFIDERA and FUMADERM, and the final drug product for our large molecule products and, to a lesser extent, product candidates.\nWe source all of our fill-finish and the majority of final product assembly and storage operations for our products, along with a substantial part of our label and packaging operations, to a concentrated group of third-party contract manufacturing organizations. Raw materials, delivery devices, such as syringes and auto-injectors, and other supplies required for the production of our products and product candidates are procured from various third-party suppliers and manufacturers in quantities adequate to meet our needs. Continuity of supply of such raw materials, devices and supplies is assured using a strategy of dual sourcing where possible or by a risk-based inventory strategy. Our third-party service providers, suppliers and manufacturers may be subject to routine cGMP inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions and undergo assessment and certification by our quality management group.\nOur Employees\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 7,400 employees worldwide.\nInformation about our Executive Officers (as of February 6, 2020)\nOfficer\nCurrent Position\nAge\nYear Joined Biogen\nMichel Vounatsos\nChief Executive Officer\nSusan H.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are substantially dependent on revenues from our products.\nOur revenues depend upon continued sales of our products, as well as the financial rights we have in our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, and, unless we develop, acquire rights to and/or commercialize new products and technologies, we will be substantially dependent on sales from our products and our financial rights in our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs for many years. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenues are concentrated on sales of our products in increasingly competitive markets. Any of the following negative developments relating to any of our products or any of our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations or could cause a decline in our stock price:\n\u2022\nsafety or efficacy issues;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain a positive reputation among patients, healthcare providers and others, which may be impacted by our pricing and reimbursement decisions;\n\u2022\nthe introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, including generics, biosimilars, prodrugs and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways;\n\u2022\nlimitations and additional pressures on product pricing or price increases, including those resulting from governmental or regulatory requirements, increased competition or changes in, or implementation of, reimbursement policies and practices of payors and other third parties; or\n\u2022\nadverse legal, administrative, regulatory or legislative developments.\nSPINRAZA has been approved by, among others, the FDA, the EC and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, and is in the early stages of commercial launch in certain markets. In addition to risks associated with new product launches and the other factors described in these Risk Factors, our ability to successfully commercialize SPINRAZA may be adversely affected due to:\n\u2022\nthe introduction of a new gene therapy product that was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 for the treatment of SMA, and other products in development that, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with SPINRAZA in the SMA market, including potential oral products;\n\u2022\nour limited marketing experience within certain SMA markets, which may impact our ability to develop additional relationships with the associated medical and scientific community; and\n\u2022\nthe lack of readiness of healthcare providers within certain SMA markets to treat patients with SMA.\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from third-party payors, which are subject to increasing and intense pressure from political, social, competitive and other sources. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate coverage, or a reduction in pricing or reimbursement, could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenues and results of operations, could curtail or eliminate our ability to adequately fund research and development programs for the discovery and commercialization of new products or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price.\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on the availability and extent of adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. When a new pharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product may be uncertain, as is the pricing and amount for which that product will be reimbursed.\nPricing and reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in, and implementation of, federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\npressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs;\n\u2022\nconsolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our\nproducts on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value; and\n\u2022\nour value-based contracting program pursuant to which we aim to tie the pricing of our products to their clinical values by either aligning price to patient outcomes or adjusting price for patients who discontinue therapy for any reason, including efficacy or tolerability concerns.\nOur ability to set the price for our products varies significantly from country to country and as a result so can the price of our products. Certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, our inability to obtain and maintain adequate prices in a particular country may not only limit the revenues from our products within that country but may also adversely affect our ability to secure acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets. This may create the opportunity for third-party cross-border trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenues.\nDrug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed. We expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. In addition, competition from current and future competitors may negatively impact our ability to maintain pricing and our market share. New products or treatments brought to market by our competitors could cause revenues for our products to decrease due to potential price reductions and lower sales volumes.\nPayors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. Many payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients' use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Payors also increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage and control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as by requiring prior authorization or step therapy. Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and pharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. Further consolidation among insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other payors would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenues and results of operations, could curtail or eliminate our ability to adequately fund research and development programs for the discovery and commercialization of new products or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The degree of patent protection afforded to our products and processes in the U.S. and in other important markets remains uncertain and depends, in part, upon decisions of the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in these countries. We may fail to successfully obtain or preserve patent protection for the technologies incorporated into our products and processes, or the protection we obtain may not be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a manufacturer may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application, seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved innovator product, or a NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator product. The manufacturers are allowed to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator's product, may not need to conduct clinical trials, can market a competing version of a product after the expiration or loss of patent exclusivity or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity and often charge significantly lower prices. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity for a product, a major portion of revenues for that product may be reduced in a short period of time. When others exploit our inventions, the expected benefit from them are reduced. Furthermore, our products may be determined to\ninfringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us.\nWe also rely on regulatory exclusivity for protection of our products. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect in each of the markets for our products due to challenges, changes or interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect our revenues for our products or our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nLitigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We also face challenges to our patent and regulatory protections covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and are often protracted, expensive and distracting to management. Negative outcomes of such proceedings adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights. Settlements of Hatch-Waxman litigation typically result in reducing the period of patent protection, accelerating reduction in revenue from affected products. Adverse outcomes in intellectual property litigation also could hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services. Any of these circumstances could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price.\nOur long-term success depends upon the successful development of new products and additional indications for existing products.\nOur long-term viability and growth will depend upon the successful development of additional indications for our existing products as well as the successful development of new products and technologies from our research and development activities, our biosimilars joint venture with Samsung BioLogics or licenses or acquisitions from third parties.\nProduct development is very expensive and involves a high degree of uncertainty and risk. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. Furthermore, the development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases, including development efforts in new modalities such as those based on the ASO platform and gene therapy, may present additional challenges and risks, including obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies that have limited experience with the development of such therapies. In addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and, even if we view data as sufficient to support the safety, effectiveness and/or approval of an investigational therapy, regulatory authorities may disagree and may require additional data, may limit the scope of the approval or may deny approval altogether. Consequently, it may be difficult to predict the time and cost of product development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases.\nIn addition, success in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful. Clinical trials may indicate that our product candidates lack efficacy, have harmful side effects, result in unexpected adverse events or raise other concerns that may significantly reduce the likelihood of regulatory approval. This may result in terminated programs, significant restrictions on use and safety warnings in an approved label, adverse placement within the treatment paradigm or significant reduction in the commercial potential of the product candidate.\nEven if we could successfully develop new products or indications, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product candidate or indication if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to the standard of care or other opportunities in our pipeline.\nIf we fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of new products and processes, the acquisition of rights to new products with commercial potential and the hiring and retention of personnel. We compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have a greater number of products on the market and in the product pipeline, substantially greater financial, marketing and research and development and other resources and other technological or competitive advantages. One or more of our competitors may benefit from significantly greater sales and marketing capabilities, may develop products that are accepted more widely than ours or may receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely affects our product development or business.\nOur products are also susceptible to increasing competition in many markets from generics, biosimilars, prodrugs and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Generic versions of drugs, biosimilars, prodrugs and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products. Accordingly, the introduction of such products, as well as other lower-priced competing products, may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which will negatively impact our revenues. In addition, when a generic version of one of our products is commercialized, it may, in some cases, be automatically substituted for our product and reduce our revenues in a short period of time.\nIn the MS market, we face intense competition as the number of products and competitors continues to expand. Due to our significant reliance on sales of our MS products, including TECFIDERA, our business could be harmed if we are unable to successfully compete in the MS market. More specifically, our ability to compete, maintain and grow our share in the MS market may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe introduction of more efficacious, safer, less expensive or more convenient alternatives to our MS products, including our own products and products of our collaborators;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of biosimilars, follow-on products, generic versions of branded MS products, prodrugs or products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways, which would be significantly less costly than our products to bring to market and would be offered for sale at lower prices, and could result in a significant percentage of the sales of our products being lost to such biosimilars, follow-on products, generic versions of branded MS products, prodrugs or products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways;\n\u2022\nthe off-label use by physicians of therapies indicated for other conditions to treat MS patients;\n\u2022\npatient dynamics, including the size of the patient population and our ability to attract and maintain new and current patients to our therapies;\n\u2022\ndamage to physician and patient confidence in any of our MS products, generic or biosimilars of our MS products or any other product from the same class as one of our products, or to our sales and reputation as a result of label changes or adverse experiences or events that may occur with patients treated with our MS products or generic or biosimilars of our MS products;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain appropriate pricing and reimbursement for our MS products compared to our competitors in key international markets; or\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patent, data or market exclusivity for our MS products.\nIn the SMA market, we face competition from a new gene therapy product that was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 for the treatment of SMA. Additionally, we are aware of other products in development that, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with SPINRAZA in the SMA market, including potential oral products. Future sales of SPINRAZA may be adversely affected by the commercialization of competing products.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute or realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic and growth initiatives.\nThe successful execution of our strategic and growth initiatives may depend upon internal development projects, commercial initiatives, external opportunities, which may include the acquisition, partnering and in-licensing of products, technologies and companies or the entry into strategic alliances and collaborations, or the disposition of certain of our assets or operations.\nWhile we believe we have a number of promising programs in our pipeline, failure or delay of internal development projects to advance or difficulties in executing on our commercial initiatives could impact our current and future growth, resulting in additional reliance on external development opportunities for growth.\nSupporting the further development of our existing products and potential new products in our pipeline will require significant capital expenditures and management resources, including investments in research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing capabilities and other areas of our business. We have in the past made, and may continue to make, significant operating and capital expenditures for potential new products in our pipeline prior to regulatory approval with no assurance that such investment will be recouped, which may adversely affect our financial condition, business and operations.\nThe availability of high quality, fairly valued external product development is limited and the opportunity for their acquisition is highly competitive. As such, we are not certain that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for acquisition or if we will be able to reach agreement. Furthermore, if we decide to dispose of certain of our assets or operations, we are not certain that we will be able to identify a suitable counterparty or if we will be able to reach agreement.\nWe may fail to initiate or complete transactions for many reasons and we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from transactions, or the benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. We may also face additional costs or liabilities in completed transactions that were not contemplated prior to completion.\nAny failure in the execution of a transaction, in the integration of an acquired asset or business or in achieving expected synergies could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of asset impairment charges and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSuccessful preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage trials, regulatory approval or commercial viability of a product.\nPositive results in a clinical trial may not be replicated in subsequent or confirmatory trials. Additionally, success in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful or that regulatory approval will be obtained. In addition, even if later stage clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may delay or decline approval of our product candidates. Regulatory authorities may disagree with our view of the data, require additional studies or disagree with our trial design or endpoints. Regulatory authorities may also fail to approve the facilities or processes used to manufacture a product candidate, our dosing or delivery methods or companion devices. Regulatory authorities may grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated. These restrictions may include limiting indications to narrow patient populations and the imposition of safety monitoring, educational requirements and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The occurrence of any of these events could result in significant costs and expenses, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.\nEven if we are able to successfully develop new products or indications, sales of new products or products with additional indications may not meet investor expectations. We may also make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product candidate or indication if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to the standard of care or other opportunities in our pipeline.\nClinical trials and the development of biopharmaceutical products is a lengthy and complex process. If we fail to adequately manage our clinical activities, our clinical trials or potential regulatory approvals may be delayed or denied.\nConducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Our ability to complete clinical trials in a timely fashion depends on a number of key factors. These factors include protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval, patient enrollment rates and compliance with cGCP. If we or our third-party clinical trial providers or third-party CROs do not successfully carry out these clinical activities, our clinical trials or the potential regulatory approval of a product candidate may be delayed or be unsuccessful.\nWe have opened clinical trial sites and are enrolling patients in a number of countries where our experience is limited. In most cases, we use the services of third parties to carry out our clinical trial related activities and rely on such parties to accurately report their results. Our reliance on third parties for these activities may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. One CRO has responsibility for a substantial portion of our activities and reporting related to our clinical trials. If this CRO does not adequately perform, many of our trials may be affected. We may need to replace our CROs. Although we believe there are a number of other CROs\nwe could engage to continue these activities, the replacement of an existing CRO may result in the delay of the affected trials or otherwise adversely affect our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates.\nAdverse safety events or restrictions on use and safety warnings for our products can negatively affect our business, product sales and stock price.\nAdverse safety events involving our marketed products, generic or biosimilar versions of our marketed products or any other products from the same class as one of our products may have a negative impact on our business. Discovery of safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling or safety monitoring, withdrawal of products from the market and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician, patient and/or investor confidence in our products and our reputation. Any of these could result in liabilities, loss of revenues, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges or other adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nRegulatory authorities are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reporting requirements. The reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or products similar to ours and public rumors about such events may increase claims against us and may also cause our product sales or stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.\nRestrictions on use or significant safety warnings that may be required to be included in the label of our products, such as the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or liver injury in the label for certain of our products, may significantly reduce expected revenues for those products and require significant expense and management time.\nA breakdown or breach of our technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon technology systems and data to operate our business. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of our technology systems and data, which includes use of cloud technologies, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). A breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or breach of our technology systems, including the cloud technologies that we utilize, and/or unauthorized access to our data and information could subject us to liability or negatively impact the operation of our business. Our technology systems, including the cloud technologies that we utilize, continue to increase in multitude and complexity, making them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by individuals authorized to access our technology systems, including the cloud technologies that we utilize, may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.\nCyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. They are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, \u201chacktivists\u201d and employees or contractors acting with malicious intent. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data. Cyber-attacks could also include supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of our products or products produced for contract manufacturing. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. In addition, our increased use of cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks, and any failure by cloud technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential or propriety information.\nWhile we continue to build and improve our systems and infrastructure, including our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business, operational or reputational harm to us, loss of competitive advantage or loss of consumer confidence. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nWe depend on relationships with collaborators, joint venture partners and other third parties for revenues, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates, which are outside of our full control.\nWe rely on a number of significant collaborative and other third-party relationships, including joint venture partners, for revenues, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates. We also outsource to third parties certain aspects of our regulatory affairs and clinical development relating to our products and product candidates. Reliance on collaborative and other third-party relationships, including joint venture partners, subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to control the resources our collaborators, joint venture partners or third parties devote to our programs, products or product candidates;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise under an agreement, including with respect to the achievement and payment of milestones or ownership of rights to technology developed with our collaborators, joint venture partners or other third parties, and the underlying agreement with our collaborators, joint venture partners or other third parties may fail to provide us with significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if the collaborators, joint ventures partners or third parties fail to perform;\n\u2022\nthe interests of our collaborators, joint venture partners or third parties may not always be aligned with our interests, and such parties may not pursue regulatory approvals or market a product in the same manner or to the same extent that we would, which could adversely affect our revenues;\n\u2022\nthird-party relationships, joint ventures and collaborations often require the parties to cooperate, and failure to do so effectively could adversely affect product sales, or the clinical development or regulatory approvals of products under joint control, could result in termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or could result in litigation or arbitration;\n\u2022\nany failure on the part of our collaborators, joint venture partners or other third parties to comply with applicable laws, regulatory requirements and/or applicable contractual obligations in the marketing, sale and maintenance of the marketing authorization of our products or to fulfill any responsibilities our collaborators, joint venture partners or other third parties may have to protect and enforce any intellectual property rights underlying our products could have an adverse effect on our revenues as well as involve us in possible legal proceedings; and\n\u2022\nany improper conduct or actions on the part of our collaborators, joint venture partners or other third parties could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and monetary and injunctive penalties, impact the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting and/or adversely impact our ability to conduct business, our operating results and our reputation.\nGiven these risks, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed, or revenues from products could decline and/or we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the collaboration arrangements and/or joint ventures.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.\nIn the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals, enactments to reform health care insurance programs and increasing pressure from social sources could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed and purchased. For example, provisions of the PPACA have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D and the expansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under Section 340B of the PHSA. These changes have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business.\nWe may face uncertainties as a result of federal and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThe administration has also indicated an intent to address prescription drug pricing and recent Congressional hearings have brought increased public attention to the costs of prescription drugs. These actions and the uncertainty about the future of the PPACA and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nThere is also significant economic pressure on state budgets that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. In recent years, some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the U.S. and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement for our products.\nIn the E.U. and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures, and may in the future implement new or additional measures, to reduce health care costs to limit the overall level of government expenditures. These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possible retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These measures have negatively impacted our revenues and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in the future.\nManagement and key personnel changes may disrupt our operations, and we may have difficulty retaining key personnel or attracting and retaining qualified replacements on a timely basis for management and other key personnel who may leave the Company.\nWe have experienced changes in management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization in recent years. Changes in management and other key personnel have the potential to disrupt our business, and any such disruption could adversely affect our operations, programs, growth, financial condition or results of operations. Further, new members of management may have different perspectives on programs and opportunities for our business, which may cause us to focus on new business opportunities or reduce or change emphasis on our existing business programs.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management and key personnel in a highly competitive environment. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them, particularly at the executive level. We may face difficulty in attracting and retaining key talent for a number of reasons, including management changes, the underperformance or discontinuation of one or more late stage programs or recruitment by competitors. We cannot ensure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our operations or that the loss of any such personnel will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business.\nOur activities, and the activities of our collaborators, distributors and other third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting and product risk management. Our interactions in the U.S. or abroad with physicians and other health care providers that prescribe or purchase our products are also subject to government regulation designed to prevent fraud and abuse in the sale and use of products and place significant restrictions on the marketing practices of health care companies. Health care companies such as ours are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with health care providers from anti-corruption enforcement officials. In addition, health care companies such as ours have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. There is also\nenhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. The U.S. government has challenged some of our donations to third-party charities that provide patient assistance. If we, or our vendors or donation recipients, are found to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations may be heightened as we continue to expand our global operations and enter new therapeutic areas with different patient populations, which may have different product distribution methods, marketing programs or patient assistance programs from those we currently utilize or support.\nConditions and regulations governing the health care industry are subject to change, with possible retroactive effect, including:\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or judicial decisions, related to health care availability, pricing or marketing practices, compliance with wage and hour laws and other employment practices, method of delivery, payment for health care products and services, compliance with health information and data privacy and security laws and regulations, tracking and reporting payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, extensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption prohibitions, product serialization and labeling requirements and used product take-back requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;\n\u2022\ngovernment shutdowns or relocations may result in delays to the review and approval process, slowing the time necessary for new drug candidates to be reviewed and/or approved, which may adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\nrequirements that provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and quality data, such as the EMA's clinical transparency policy, which could impact our ability to protect trade secrets and competitively-sensitive information contained in approval applications or could be misinterpreted leading to reputational damage, misperception or legal action, which could harm our business; and\n\u2022\nchanges in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products.\nViolations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions against us, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as against executives overseeing our business. In addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay amounts we received from government payors or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, collaborators, partners or third-party providers that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.\nWe are increasing our presence in international markets, particularly emerging markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in international markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability and may have a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices. Further, certain countries may require local clinical trial data as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner or collaborate with or acquire in emerging markets.\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nless favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;\n\u2022\nthe introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, including generics, biosimilars, prodrugs and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nlimitations and additional pressures on our ability to obtain and maintain product pricing or receive price increases, including those resulting from governmental or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully complete subsequent or confirmatory clinical trials in countries where our experience is limited;\n\u2022\nlonger payment and reimbursement cycles and uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely impact our revenues, net income and value of certain of our investments;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of governmental controls;\n\u2022\ndiverse data privacy and protection requirements;\n\u2022\nincreasingly complex standards for complying with foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation in the U.K., including the Bribery Act, and elsewhere and escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws;\n\u2022\nthe effects of the implementation of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the E.U., known as Brexit;\n\u2022\ncompliance with complex import and export control laws;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on direct investments by foreign entities and trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ngreater political or economic instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs or embargoes and other trade restrictions, including the recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China and the possibility of additional tariffs or other trade restrictions relating to trade between the two countries; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of public health epidemics on employees and the global economy, such as the coronavirus currently impacting China and elsewhere.\nIn addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political\ncandidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe are building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility, which will result in the incurrence of significant investment with no assurance that such investment will be recouped.\nWe believe we currently have sufficient large-scale manufacturing capacity to meet our near-term manufacturing requirements. However, in order to support our drug development pipeline, in 2015 we made the decision to expand our large molecule production capacity by building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland with no assurance that the additional capacity would be required. We expect the Solothurn manufacturing facility to be partially operational by the end of 2020; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our expected timeline. If there are delays in bringing the Solothurn manufacturing facility online, we may not have sufficient large-scale manufacturing capacity to meet our long-term manufacturing requirements.\nIn addition, we have made significant investments in connection with the building of this manufacturing facility with no assurance that such investment will be recouped. If we are unable to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates or if we do not fully utilize our manufacturing facilities, our business may be harmed. Charges resulting from excess capacity would have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nManufacturing issues could substantially increase our costs, limit supply of our products and/or reduce our revenues.\nThe process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nRisks of Reliance on Third Parties and Single Source Providers. We rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers for many aspects of our manufacturing process for our products and product candidates. In some cases, due to the unique manner in which our products are manufactured, we rely on single source providers of raw materials and manufacturing supplies. These third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are outside of our control. These third parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations, and they may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our existing or future products. Finding alternative providers could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the specialized nature of the services and the need to obtain regulatory approval of any significant changes to our suppliers or manufacturing methods. We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement with alternative providers or that the FDA or other regulatory authorities would approve our use of such alternatives.\n\u2022\nRisks Relating to Compliance with cGMP. We and our third-party providers are generally required to maintain compliance with cGMP and other stringent requirements and are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions and damage our reputation.\n\u2022\nGlobal Bulk Supply Risks. We rely on our principal manufacturing facilities for the production of drug substance for our large molecule products and product candidates. Our global bulk supply of these products and product candidates depends on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities, which could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures, cyber-attacks and numerous other factors. In addition, we are building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland, which we expect to be partially operational by the end of 2020. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our expected timeline. If there are delays in bring\nthe Solothurn manufacturing facility online, we may not have sufficient large-scale manufacturing capacity to meet our long-term manufacturing requirements.\n\u2022\nRisk of Product Loss. The manufacturing process for our products is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, oxidation, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or manufacturing facilities, we may need to close our manufacturing facilities for an extended period of time to investigate and remediate the contaminant.\nAny adverse developments affecting our manufacturing operations or the operations of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenues or market share as patients and physicians turn to competing therapeutics, diminish our profitability or damage our reputation.\nIn addition, although we have business continuity plans to reduce the potential for manufacturing disruptions or delays and reduce the severity of a disruptive event, there is no guarantee that these plans will be adequate, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur success in commercializing biosimilars developed by Samsung Bioepis is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in the development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilars. If Samsung Bioepis is unsuccessful in the development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilars, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investment in Samsung Bioepis.\nOur success in commercializing biosimilars developed by Samsung Bioepis is subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nReliance on Third Parties. We are dependent on the efforts of Samsung Bioepis and other third parties over whom we have limited or no control in the development and manufacturing of biosimilars products. In addition, following the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations, we are dependent on FUJIFILM for the manufacture of biosimilar products. If Samsung Bioepis, FUJIFILM or other third parties fail to perform successfully, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investment in Samsung Bioepis;\n\u2022\nRegulatory Compliance. Biosimilar products may face regulatory hurdles or delays due to the evolving and uncertain regulatory and commercial pathway of biosimilars products in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nIntellectual Property and Regulatory Challenges. Biosimilar products may face extensive patent clearances, patent infringement litigation, injunctions or regulatory challenges, which could prevent the commercial launch of a product or delay it for many years or result in imposition of monetary damages, penalties or other civil sanctions and damage our reputation;\n\u2022\nFailure to Gain Market and Patient Acceptance. Market success of biosimilar products will be adversely affected if patients, physicians and/or payors do not accept biosimilar products as safe and efficacious products offering a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies;\n\u2022\nAbility to Provide Adequate Supply. Manufacturing biosimilars is complex. If we encounter any manufacturing or supply chain difficulties, we may be unable to meet higher than anticipated demand. In addition, following the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations, we are dependent on FUJIFILM for the manufacture of biosimilar products. FUJIFILM may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations and may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our existing or future biosimilar products;\n\u2022\nCompetitive Challenges. Biosimilar products face significant competition, including from innovator products and from biosimilar products offered by other companies. In some jurisdictions, local tendering processes may restrict biosimilar products from being marketed and sold in those jurisdictions. The number of competitors in a jurisdiction, the timing of approval and the ability to market biosimilar products successfully in a timely and cost-effective manner are additional factors that may impact our success and/or the success of Samsung Bioepis in this business area; and\n\u2022\nLegal and Regulatory Requirements. Any improper conduct or actions on the part of Samsung Bioepis or our joint venture partner, Samsung BioLogics, could damage our reputation and be distracting to management. In particular, Samsung BioLogics is currently subject to an ongoing criminal investigation, which may impact the operations of Samsung Bioepis and its business or divert the attention of the Samsung Bioepis management team from its ongoing operations and business.\nIf Samsung Bioepis is unsuccessful in the development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilar products, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investment in Samsung Bioepis.\nIn addition, as Samsung Bioepis is a privately-held entity, our ability to liquidate our investment in Samsung Bioepis may be limited and we may realize significantly less than the value of such investment.\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.\nOur quarterly revenues, expenses and net income (loss) have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to the risks described in these Risk Factors as well as the timing of charges and expenses that we may take. We have recorded, or may be required to record, charges that include:\n\u2022\nthe cost of restructurings or other initiatives to streamline our operations and reallocate resources;\n\u2022\nimpairments with respect to investments, fixed assets and long-lived assets, including in-process research and development (IPR&D) and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\ninventory write-downs for failed quality specifications, charges for excess or obsolete inventory and charges for inventory write downs relating to product suspensions, expirations or recalls;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair value of contingent consideration;\n\u2022\nbad debt expenses and increased bad debt reserves;\n\u2022\noutcomes of litigation and other legal or administrative proceedings, regulatory matters and tax matters;\n\u2022\nmilestone payments under license and collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\npayments in connection with acquisitions, divestitures and other business development activities; and\n\u2022\nfailure to meet certain contractual commitments, including, for example, the minimum batch production commitment guarantees we have provided as part of the transaction with FUJIFILM.\nOur revenues and certain assets and liabilities are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. Although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to mitigate the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and other currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. Our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign currency hedge transactions. In particular, we may incur higher than expected charges from early termination of a hedge relationship.\nOur operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the anticipated results of future periods.\nOur effective tax rate fluctuates, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nAs a global biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates (including withholding taxes) in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, interpretations by tax authorities or other bodies with jurisdiction, the result of tax cases, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws either prospectively or retrospectively (including by regulation). Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.\nIn addition, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities and future changes in the tax laws, among other things, may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial\nstatements.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act) resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation. The 2017 Tax Act also transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and collaborations to immediate U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) or Subpart F income, and includes base erosion prevention measures on U.S. earnings and the reduced effective tax rate on income that comes from U.S. exports, called Foreign Derived Intangible Income. These changes became effective in 2018.\nThe 2017 Tax Act also includes a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings (the Transition Toll Tax). The Transition Toll Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, which started in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\nOur estimates concerning the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our accounting and on our business remain subject to developing interpretations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the 2017 Tax Act may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Swiss Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) will result in significant changes to the Swiss cantonal income tax system. These changes include the elimination of historic favorable cantonal tax regimes, the introduction of a patent box regime and the introduction of a research and development super deduction. The TRAF also provides for transitional rules to lessen the immediate impact of the elimination of the favorable cantonal tax regimes. These changes became effective on January 1, 2020. In response to the TRAF, each canton must enact cantonal tax reform to comply with the framework provided by the TRAF and are also expected to lower the statutory tax rate to compensate for the elimination of the historic favorable cantonal tax regimes. We will account for the impact of the TRAF and the specific cantonal tax reform changes in the period in which each canton in which we operate enacts the cantonal tax reform. Zug, a canton in which we operate, enacted cantonal tax reform in the third quarter of 2019 and Solothurn, another canton in which we operate, will hold a public referendum on the enactment of cantonal tax reform on February 9, 2020. Upon the enactment of Zug cantonal tax reform, we were required to remeasure our Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities, to account for the elimination of the historic favorable cantonal tax regimes, the impact of the transitional rules and the change in the statutory cantonal tax rate. Further remeasurement of our Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities could have a significant impact on our income tax provision in the period of enactment.\nIn addition, the enactment of some or all of the recommendations set forth or that may be forthcoming in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s project on \u201cBase Erosion and Profit Shifting\u201d (BEPS) by tax authorities and economic blocs in the countries in which we operate, could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate. These initiatives focus on common international principles for the entitlement to taxation of global corporate profits and minimum global tax rates.\nOur investments in properties may not be fully realized.\nWe own or lease real estate primarily consisting of buildings that contain research laboratories, office space and manufacturing operations. For strategic or other operational reasons, we may decide to consolidate or co-locate certain aspects of our business operations or dispose of one or more of our properties, some of which may be located in markets that are experiencing high vacancy rates and decreasing property values. If we determine that the fair value of any of our owned properties is lower than their book value, we may not realize the full investment in these properties and incur significant impairment charges or additional depreciation when the expected useful lives of certain assets have been shortened due to the anticipated closing of facilities. If we decide to fully or partially vacate an owned or leased property, we may incur significant cost, including facility closing costs, employee separation and retention expenses, lease termination fees, rent expense in excess of sublease income and impairment of leasehold improvements and accelerated depreciation of assets. Any of these events may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur portfolio of marketable securities is subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce its value.\nWe maintain a portfolio of marketable securities for investment of our cash. Changes in the value of our portfolio of marketable securities could adversely affect our earnings. In particular, the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates, downgrades of the bonds and other securities included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio, declines in\nthe value of collateral underlying the securities included in our portfolio and other factors. Each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks through diversification of our investments and continuous monitoring of our portfolio's overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares or that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices.\nFrom time to time our Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs, including our March 2019 Share Repurchase Program and our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program. The amount and timing of share repurchases are subject to capital availability and our determination that share repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the repurchase of shares. Our ability to repurchase shares will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, our results of operations, our financial condition and other factors beyond our control that we may deem relevant. A reduction in repurchases under, or the completion of, our 2019 share repurchase programs could have a negative effect on our stock price. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices, if at all.\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us.\nWe may seek access to the capital and credit markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements and other business initiatives. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the past, which leads to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital or credit market financing on favorable terms. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.\nOur indebtedness, together with our significant contingent liabilities, including milestone and royalty payment obligations, could have important consequences to our business; for example, such obligations could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to access capital markets and incur additional debt in the future;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts, research and development and mergers and acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury.\nOur business and the business of several of our strategic partners involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with state, federal and foreign standards, there will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended facility shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm our business. Manufacturing of our products and product candidates also requires permits from government agencies for water supply and wastewater discharge. If we do not obtain appropriate permits, including permits for sufficient quantities of water and wastewater, we could incur significant costs and limits on our manufacturing volumes that could harm our business.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or unfit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nThird parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing, distribution and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit drug may\nbe at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, inventory that is stolen from warehouses, plants or while in-transit, and that is subsequently improperly stored and sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend the company or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.\nSome of our collaboration agreements contain change in control provisions that may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us.\nSome of our collaboration agreements include change in control provisions that could reduce the potential acquisition price an acquirer is willing to pay or discourage a takeover attempt that could be viewed as beneficial to shareholders. Upon a change in control, some of these provisions could trigger reduced milestone, profit or royalty payments to us or give our collaboration partner rights to terminate our collaboration agreement, acquire operational control or force the purchase or sale of the programs that are the subject of the collaboration.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes beginning on page of this report.\nFor our discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, please read Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our 2018 Form 10-K.\nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction\nBiogen is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and delivering worldwide innovative therapies for people living with serious neurological and neurodegenerative diseases as well as related therapeutic adjacencies. Our core growth areas include MS and neuroimmunology; AD and dementia; neuromuscular disorders, including SMA and ALS; movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease; and ophthalmology. We are also focused on discovering, developing and delivering worldwide innovative therapies in our emerging growth areas of immunology; neurocognitive disorders; acute neurology; and pain. In addition, we commercialize biosimilars of advanced biologics. We support our drug discovery and development efforts through the commitment of significant resources to discovery, research and development programs and business development opportunities.\nOur marketed products include TECFIDERA, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI, VUMERITY and FAMPYRA for the treatment of MS; SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA; and FUMADERM for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis. We also have certain business and financial rights with respect to RITUXAN for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL and other conditions; RITUXAN HYCELA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL; GAZYVA for the treatment of CLL and follicular lymphoma; OCREVUS for the treatment of PPMS and RMS; and other potential anti-CD20 therapies pursuant to our collaboration arrangements with Genentech. For additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOur innovative drug development and commercialization activities are complemented by our biosimilar products that expand access to medicines\nand reduce the cost burden for healthcare systems. Through Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture with Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd., we market and sell BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL, IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA, and FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, in certain countries in Europe and have exclusive rights to commercialize these products in China. Additionally, we have exclusive rights to commercialize two potential ophthalmology biosimilar products, SB11 referencing LUCENTIS and SB15 referencing EYLEA, in major markets worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia. For additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOur revenues depend upon continued sales of our products, as well as the financial rights we have in our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, and, unless we develop, acquire rights to and/or commercialize new products and technologies, we will be substantially dependent on sales from our products and our financial rights in our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs for many years.\nIn the longer term, our revenue growth will depend upon the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products as well as additional indications for our existing products, our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other rights related to our marketed products, assets originating from our research and development efforts and/or successful execution of external business development opportunities.\nBusiness Environment\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are working to develop or have commercialized products similar to those we market or are developing and have considerable experience in undertaking clinical trials and in obtaining regulatory approval to market pharmaceutical products. In addition, the commercialization of certain of our own approved products, products of our collaborators and pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of our existing products.\nOur products continue to face increasing competitive pressures from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products as well as products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products, which may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell. In addition, when\na generic version of one of our products is commercialized, it may, in some cases, be automatically substituted for our product and reduce our revenues in a short period of time.\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on the availability and extent of adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. When a new pharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product may be uncertain, as is the pricing and amount for which that product will be reimbursed.\nDrug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed. We expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenues and results of operations, could curtail or eliminate our ability to adequately fund research and development programs for the discovery and commercialization of new products or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price.\nIn addition to the impact of competition, pricing actions and other measures being taken worldwide designed to reduce healthcare costs and limit the overall level of government expenditures, our sales and operations could also be affected by other risks of doing business internationally, including the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, changes in intellectual property legal protections and changes in trade regulations and procedures as well as the impact of the continued uncertainty of the credit and economic conditions in certain countries in Europe.\nFor additional information on our competition and pricing risks that could negatively impact our product sales, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this report.\nBrexit\nIn June 2016 the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to voluntarily depart from the E.U., known as Brexit. In March 2017 the U.K. government formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the E.U. and began to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal and outline the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. upon exit, which occurred on January 31, 2020. Following the U.K.\u2019s departure, there is now a transition period during which existing arrangements will remain in place until the end of 2020, allowing detailed discussions on the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. to take place.\nThe potential impact on our results of operations and liquidity resulting from Brexit remains unclear. The actual effects of Brexit will depend upon many factors and significant uncertainty remains with respect to the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. The final outcome of the discussions during the transition period may impact certain of our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the E.U., including the approval and supply of our products.\nCompliance with any resulting regulatory mandates may prove challenging and the macroeconomic impact on our sales and consolidated results of operations from these developments remains unknown. We do not, however, expect Brexit to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations as approximately 3.5%, 3.3% and 3.2% of our total product revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from U.K. sales.\nWe have implemented measures to meet E.U. legal and regulatory requirements and to continue to modify our business operations to prepare for the finalization of the terms of the U.K.'s separation from the E.U. However, we cannot predict the direction Brexit-related developments will take nor the impact of those developments on our European operations and the economies of the markets where we operate. Therefore, we will continue to monitor for developments in this area and assess any potential impact on our business and results of operations.\nFinancial Highlights\nDiluted earnings per share attributable to Biogen Inc. were $31.42 for 2019, representing an increase of 45.6% over $21.58 in the same period in 2018.\nAs described below under Results of Operations, our net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Biogen Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, reflects the following:\n\u2022\nTotal revenues were $14,377.9 million for 2019, representing an increase of 6.9% over $13,452.9 million in 2018.\n\u2022\nProduct revenues, net totaled $11,379.8 million for 2019, representing an increase of 4.5% over $10,886.8 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 21.6% increase in revenues from SPINRAZA and a 35.4% increase in revenues from our biosimilar business. Product revenues, net, compared to the same period in 2018, further reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $53.0 million.\n\u2022\nRevenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs totaled $2,290.4 million for 2019, representing an increase of 15.7% over $1,980.2 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in royalty revenues on sales of OCREVUS.\n\u2022\nOther revenues totaled $707.7 million for 2019, representing an increase of 20.8% over $585.9 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues from our manufacturing and supply agreement with Bioverativ, partially offset by lower revenues from other contract manufacturing agreements.\n\u2022\nTotal cost and expenses totaled $7,335.3 million for 2019, representing a decrease of 3.0% from $7,564.3 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to:\n\u25e6\na 12.2% decrease in research and development expense, primarily due to the $482.6 million net charge recognized in 2018 upon the closing of the 2018 Ionis Agreement;\n\u25e6\na 34.4% decrease in amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets, primarily due to the $366.1 million impairment charges recognized in 2018, which lowered amortization expense in subsequent periods, partially offset by the $215.9 million impairment charges recognized in 2019; and\n\u25e6\na net change in (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration, primarily due to the gain recognized on the remeasurement of our continent consideration obligation related to the Phase 2b study of BG00011 for the potential treatment of IPF.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\n\u25e6\na 12.7% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increased commercial and medical investments as well as the timing of spend on selling, general and administrative expense; and\n\u25e6\na 7.7% increase in cost of sales, primarily due to our sales in 2019 to Bioverativ of hemophilia-related inventory on hand as of December 31, 2018, and an increase in sales of products within our biosimilar business.\n\u2022\nNet income attributable to Biogen Inc. was favorably impacted by a decrease in our effective tax rate to 16.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 24.2% for 2018, due in part to an internal reorganization of certain intellectual property rights, the impact of Swiss Tax Reform and the 2018 unfavorable impacts of U.S. Tax Reform.\nAs described below under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources:\n\u2022\nWe generated $7,078.6 million of net cash flows from operations for 2019, which were primarily driven by earnings.\n\u2022\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $5,884.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022\nWe repurchased and retired approximately 23.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $5.8 billion during 2019 under our March 2019 Share Repurchase Program and our 2018 Share Repurchase Program.\nAcquisitions, Collaborative and Other Relationships\nFor additional information on our acquisitions, collaborative and other relationships discussed below, please read Note 2, Acquisitions, Note 3, Divestitures, Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, and Note 19, Investments in Variable Interest Entities, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nSkyhawk Therapeutics, Inc.\nIn January 2019 we entered into a collaboration and research and development services agreement with Skyhawk pursuant to which the companies are leveraging Skyhawk's SkySTAR technology platform with the goal of discovering innovative small molecule treatments for patients with neurological diseases, including MS and SMA. In connection with this agreement, we made an upfront payment of $74.0 million to Skyhawk. We are responsible for the development and potential commercialization of any therapies resulting from this collaboration. In October 2019 we amended this agreement to add an additional discovery program. In connection with this amendment, we made a payment to Skyhawk of $15.0 million.\nAcquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics plc\nIn June 2019 we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of NST, a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on AAV treatments for inherited retinal disorders. As a result of this acquisition, we added two mid- to late-stage clinical assets, as well as preclinical programs, in ophthalmology. These assets include BIIB111, which is in Phase 3 development for the potential treatment of CHM, a rare, degenerative, X-linked inherited retinal disorder that leads to blindness and currently has no approved treatments, and BIIB112 (RPGR gene therapy), which is in Phase 2/3 development for the potential treatment of XLRP, which is a rare inherited retinal disease with no currently approved treatments.\nUnder the terms of the acquisition, we paid NST shareholders $25.50 in cash for each issued and outstanding NST share, which totaled $847.6 million.\nDivestiture of Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark Manufacturing Operations\nIn August 2019 we completed the sale of all of the outstanding shares of our subsidiary that owned our biologics manufacturing operations in Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark to FUJIFILM. Upon the closing of this transaction, we received approximately $881.9 million in cash, which may be adjusted based on other contractual terms. In addition, we sold to FUJIFILM $41.8 million of raw materials that were remaining at the Hiller\u00f8d facility on the closing date of this transaction.\nSamsung Bioepis\nIn December 2019 we completed a transaction with Samsung Bioepis and secured the exclusive rights to commercialize two potential ophthalmology biosimilar products, SB11 referencing LUCENTIS and SB15 referencing EYLEA, in major markets worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia. We also acquired an option to extend our existing commercial agreement with Samsung Bioepis for BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in Europe and obtained exclusive rights to commercialize these products in China. In connection with this transaction, we made an upfront payment of $100.0 million to Samsung Bioepis.\nBIIB080 Option Exercise\nIn December 2019 we exercised our option with Ionis and obtained a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize BIIB080, an investigational treatment for AD.\nPfizer Inc.\nIn January 2020 we entered into an agreement to acquire PF-05251749, a novel CNS-penetrant small molecule inhibitor of CK1, for the potential treatment of patients with behavioral and neurological symptoms across various psychiatric and neurological diseases from Pfizer. In particular, we plan to develop the Phase 1 asset for the treatment of sundowning in AD and ISWRD in Parkinson\u2019s disease. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2020.\nOther Key Developments\nVUMERITY\nIn October 2019 the FDA approved VUMERITY for the treatment of RMS. Under the terms of the license and collaboration agreement with Alkermes, we made milestone payments totaling $155.0 million to Alkermes following the FDA's approval of VUMERITY. In November 2019 VUMERITY became available in the U.S.\nAducanumab\nIn October 2019 we and our collaboration partner Eisai announced that we plan to pursue regulatory approval for aducanumab in the U.S. and that the Phase 3 EMERGE study met its primary endpoint showing a significant reduction in clinical decline. We believe that results from a subset of patients in the Phase 3 ENGAGE study who received sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab support findings from EMERGE. The decision to file is based on a new analysis, conducted in consultation with the FDA, of a larger dataset from the Phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE trials that were discontinued in March 2019 following a futility analysis.\nFor additional information on our plans to file for regulatory approval for aducanumab, please read the\nsubsection entitled \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included below.\nElenbecestat\nIn September 2019 we and our collaboration partner Eisai announced the decision to discontinue the global Phase 3 studies (MISSION AD1 and MISSION AD2) of the investigational oral BACE inhibitor elenbecestat in patients with early AD.\n2019 Share Repurchase Programs\nIn March 2019 our Board of Directors authorized our March 2019 Share Repurchase Program, which is a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock. Our March 2019 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. All share repurchases under our March 2019 Share Repurchase Program will be retired.\nIn December 2019 our Board of Directors authorized our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program, which is a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock. Our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. All share repurchases under our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program will be retired.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nRevenues are summarized as follows:\nProduct Revenues\nProduct revenues are summarized as follows:\n* Interferon includes AVONEX and PLEGRIDY.\n** Percentage not meaningful.\nMultiple Sclerosis\nTECFIDERA\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the 1.6% increase in U.S. TECFIDERA revenues was primarily due to a slight net price increase, offset by a small decrease in unit sales volume.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the 10.3% increase in rest of world TECFIDERA revenues was primarily due to increases in unit sales volume of 14%, primarily related to our European and Japanese markets, and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $16.5 million, partially offset by pricing reductions in certain European countries.\nIn February 2020 the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) decided that our U.S. Patent No. 8,399,514 (the \u2018514 Patent) is patentable. The \u2018514 Patent covers treatment of MS with 480 mg of dimethyl fumarate per day as provided for in our TECFIDERA label. This decision may be appealed.\nThe \u2018514 Patent has also been challenged pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act in the U.S. District Courts of Delaware (the Delaware action) and West Virginia (the West Virginia action). We are awaiting a decision in the Delaware action and the trial in the West Virginia action is ongoing. If we receive an adverse judgment in either U.S. District Court action, we will appeal but we may face generic competition while our appeal is pending.\nWe will face TECFIDERA generic competition if an adverse PTAB or U.S. District Court decision is reached on appeal. In addition, we have entered into settlement agreements with some of the defendants in the Delaware action and we now anticipate TECFIDERA generic competition before the \u2018514 Patent expires in February 2028. Generic competition\nis expected to have an adverse impact on our TECFIDERA sales and our results of operations. For additional information, please read Note 20, Litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe anticipate an increase in TECFIDERA demand in rest of world in 2020, compared to 2019, notwithstanding the increasing competition from additional treatments for MS. We expect volume growth in our rest of world markets to offset volume declines in the U.S.\nInterferon\nAVONEX and PLEGRIDY\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the 14.5% decrease in U.S. Interferon revenues was primarily due to a decrease in Interferon unit sales volumes of 13%, which was primarily attributable to patients transitioning to other MS therapies and a net price decrease.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the 2.8% decrease in rest of world Interferon revenues was primarily due to pricing reductions in certain European countries.\nWe expect that Interferon revenues will continue to decline in both the U.S. and rest of world markets in 2020, compared to 2019, as a result of increasing competition from our other MS products as well as other treatments for MS, including biosimilars, and pricing reductions in certain European markets.\nAVONEX\nFor 2019, 2018 and 2017 U.S. AVONEX revenues totaled $1,202.1 million, $1,420.2 million and $1,593.6 million, respectively.\nFor 2019, 2018 and 2017 rest of world AVONEX revenues totaled $463.8 million, $495.3 million and $557.9 million, respectively.\nPLEGRIDY\nFor 2019, 2018 and 2017 U.S. PLEGRIDY revenues totaled $224.5 million, $248.1 million and $295.5 million, respectively.\nFor 2019, 2018 and 2017 rest of world PLEGRIDY revenues totaled $211.4 million, $199.4 million and $198.8 million, respectively.\nTYSABRI\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the 1.6% increase in U.S. TYSABRI revenues was primarily due to price increases, partially offset by a decrease in unit sales volumes of 4%.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the 1.4% increase in rest of world TYSABRI revenues was primarily due to an increase in unit sales volumes of 3%.\nWe anticipate TYSABRI demand to be stable on a global basis in 2020, compared to 2019, with expected volume declines in the U.S. due to increasing competition from additional treatments for MS, including OCREVUS, offset by volume growth in our rest of world markets, net of price reductions in certain rest of world countries.\nSpinal Muscular Atrophy\nSPINRAZA\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the 9.3% increase in U.S. SPINRAZA revenues was primarily due to increases in unit sales volume of 9%.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the 33.7% increase in rest of world SPINRAZA revenues was primarily due to an increase in unit sales volumes of 69%, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $43.5 million.\nWe expect that the rate at which SPINRAZA revenues will grow will moderate in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to a lower rate of new patient starts combined with the impact of loading dose dynamics as patients transition to dosing once every four months.\nWe face competition from a new gene therapy product that was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 for the treatment of SMA. Additionally, we are aware of other products in development that, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with SPINRAZA in the SMA market, including potential oral products. Future sales of SPINRAZA may be adversely affected by the commercialization of competing products.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Ionis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nBiosimilars\nBENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the 35.4% increase in biosimilar revenues was primarily due to the launch of IMRALDI in the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange of $27.8 million.\nIn 2020 we expect strong revenue growth for our biosimilars business, primarily driven by the continued launch of IMRALDI in Europe, partially offset by price reductions in certain European countries.\nIn December 2019 we completed a transaction with Samsung Bioepis and secured the exclusive rights to commercialize two potential ophthalmology biosimilars, SB11 referencing LUCENTIS and SB15 referencing EYLEA, in major markets worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia. We also acquired an option to extend our existing commercial agreement with Samsung Bioepis for BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in Europe and obtained exclusive rights to commercialize these products in China.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRevenues from Anti-CD20 Therapeutic Programs\nGenentech Inc. (Roche Group)\nOur share of RITUXAN, including RITUXAN HYCELA, and GAZYVA collaboration operating profits in the U.S. and other revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs are summarized in the table below. For purposes of this discussion we refer to RITUXAN and RITUXAN HYCELA collectively as RITUXAN.\nBiogen\u2019s Share of Pre-tax Profits in the U.S. for RITUXAN and GAZYVA\nThe following table provides a summary of amounts comprising our share of pre-tax profits in the U.S. for RITUXAN and GAZYVA:\nOur share of RITUXAN annual pre-tax co-promotion profits in the U.S. in excess of $50.0 million decreased to 37.5% from 39% in the third quarter of 2017 as gross sales of GAZYVA in the U.S.\nfor the preceding 12-month period exceeded $150.0 million.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the increase in U.S. product revenues, net was primarily due to increased net sales of RITUXAN in the U.S. of 5.0%, which reflects an increase in unit sales volume of 3%, and selling price increases, partially offset by higher rates in discounts and allowances.\nThe increase in U.S. product revenues, net over 2018 also reflects an increase in GAZYVA unit sales volume of 21%.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the decrease in collaboration costs and expenses was primarily due to lower cost of sales and lower selling and marketing costs on RITUXAN and lower Branded Pharmaceutical Drug fee expenses for RITUXAN and GAZYVA.\nWe are aware of anti-CD20 molecules, including biosimilar products, in development that if successfully developed and approved, could compete with RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the oncology market. The introduction of a biosimilar product can result in a significant reduction in net sales for the relevant product, as other manufacturers typically offer their versions at lower prices. In November 2019 and January 2020 biosimilar products referencing RITUXAN were launched in the U.S. and this could adversely affect the pre-tax profits of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, which could, in turn, adversely affect our co-promotion profits in the U.S. in future years.\nOther Revenues from Anti-CD20 Therapeutic Programs\nOther revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs consist of royalty revenues on sales of OCREVUS and our share of pre-tax co-promotion profits from RITUXAN in Canada.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the increase in other revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs was primarily due to the sales growth of OCREVUS. Royalty revenues recognized on sales of OCREVUS for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, totaled $687.5 million, $478.3 million and $159.3 million, respectively.\nOCREVUS royalty revenues are based on our estimates from third party and market research data of OCREVUS sales occurring during the corresponding period. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenues will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is expected to be the following quarter.\nIn March 2017 the FDA approved OCREVUS for the treatment of RMS and PPMS. Pursuant to the terms of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, we receive a tiered royalty on U.S. net sales from 13.5% and increasing up to 24% if annual net sales exceed $900.0 million. There will be a 50% reduction to these royalties if a biosimilar to OCREVUS is approved in the U.S.\nIn addition, we receive a gross 3% royalty on net sales of OCREVUS outside the U.S., with the royalty period lasting 11 years from the first commercial sale of OCREVUS on a country-by-country basis. OCREVUS has been approved for the treatment of RMS and PPMS in the E.U. and certain other countries.\nThe commercialization of OCREVUS does not impact the percentage of the co-promotion profits we receive for RITUXAN or GAZYVA. Genentech is solely responsible for development and commercialization of OCREVUS and funding future costs. Genentech cannot develop OCREVUS in CLL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or rheumatoid arthritis.\nFor additional information on our relationship with Genentech, including information regarding the pre-tax profit-sharing formula and its impact on future revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues are summarized as follows:\nRevenues from Collaborative and Other Relationships\nRevenues from collaborative and other relationships primarily include revenues from our technical development services and manufacturing agreements with Samsung Bioepis and royalty revenues on biosimilar products from Samsung Bioepis.\nFollowing the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations in August 2019, FUJIFILM assumed responsibility for the manufacture of clinical and commercial quantities of bulk drug substance of biosimilar products for Samsung Bioepis. We no longer recognize revenues for the manufacturing completed after the divestiture date under our technical development services and manufacturing agreements with Samsung Bioepis.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $106.2 million and $96.4 million, respectively, related to the services described above provided to Samsung Bioepis.\nFor additional information on our collaborative and other relationships, including revenues recognized under our technical development services and manufacturing agreements with Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOther Royalty and Corporate Revenues\nWe receive royalties from net sales on products related to patents that we have out-licensed and we record other corporate revenues primarily from amounts earned under contract manufacturing agreements.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the increase in other royalty and corporate revenues was primarily due to $383.2 million in revenues recognized in 2019 under the manufacturing and supply agreement with Bioverativ entered into in connection with the spin-off of our hemophilia business, compared to $206.7 million recognized in 2018. The increase in Bioverativ revenues in 2019 over the prior year period was due to our sales in 2019 of hemophilia-related inventory on hand as of December 31, 2018. The increase in corporate revenues was partially offset by the reduction in royalty revenues due to the expiration of certain of our patents and a reduction in revenues from contract manufacturing agreements, other than Bioverativ, as discussed above.\nReserves for Discounts and Allowances\nRevenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain international markets where we operate.\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). These estimates reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nReserves for discounts, contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenues are summarized as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, reserves for discounts and allowances as a percentage of gross product revenues were 24.3%, 23.7% and 22.0%, respectively.\nDiscounts\nDiscounts include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, discounts were relatively consistent.\nContractual Adjustments\nContractual adjustments primarily relate to Medicaid and managed care rebates, co-payment assistance (copay), VA and PHS discounts, specialty pharmacy program fees and other government rebates or applicable allowances.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the increase in contractual adjustments was primarily due to higher managed care rebates and governmental rebates in the U.S. as well as higher governmental rebates and allowances in the rest of world, due in part to an increase in SPINRAZA sales volumes worldwide.\nReturns\nProduct return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Provisions for product returns are recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, return reserves were relatively consistent.\nFor additional information on our revenue reserves, please read Note 4, Revenues, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCost and Expenses\nA summary of total cost and expenses is as follows:\n** Percentage not meaningful.\nCost of Sales, Excluding Amortization and Impairment of Acquired Intangible Assets (Cost of Sales)\nCost of sales, as a percentage of total revenues, were 13.6%, 13.5% and 13.3% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nProduct Cost of Sales\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the increase in product cost of sales was primarily due to our sale in 2019 to Bioverativ of hemophilia-related inventory on hand as of December 31, 2018, with a cost basis totaling $184.5 million pursuant to the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement with Bioverativ\nentered into in connection with the spin-off of our hemophilia business.\nAdditionally, the increase in product cost of sales was attributable to an increase in sales of products within our biosimilar business and an increase in inventory amounts written down as a result of excess, obsolescence, unmarketability or other reasons, partially offset by lower cost of sales from our contract manufacturing agreements, except Bioverativ, as discussed above.\nInventory amounts written down as a result of excess, obsolescence, unmarketability or other reasons totaled $52.2 million, $41.9 million and $76.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRoyalty Cost of Sales\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the decrease in royalty cost of sales was primarily due to a decrease in royalties payable on sales of TYSABRI resulting from the expiration of certain third party royalties, partially offset by increased royalties payable on higher sales of SPINRAZA and IMRALDI.\nResearch and Development\nWe support our drug discovery and development efforts through the commitment of significant resources to discovery, research and development programs and business development opportunities.\nA significant amount of our research and development costs consist of indirect costs incurred in support of overall research and development activities and non-specific programs, including activities that benefit multiple programs, such as management costs, as well as depreciation, information technology and facility-based expenses. These costs are considered other research and development costs in the table above and are not allocated to a specific program or stage.\nResearch and development expense incurred in support of our marketed products includes costs associated with product lifecycle management activities including, if applicable, costs associated with the development of new indications for existing products. Late stage programs are programs in Phase 3 development or in registration stage. Early stage programs are programs in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development. Research and discovery represents costs incurred to support our discovery research and translational science efforts. Costs are reflected in the development stage based upon the program status when incurred. Therefore, the same program could be reflected in different development stages in the same year. For several of our programs, the research and development activities are part of our collaborative and other relationships. Our costs reflect our share of the total costs incurred.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to a decrease in milestone and upfront expenses and a decrease in other research and development costs. These decreases were partially offset by increases in costs incurred in connection with our early stage programs and marketed products.\nWe intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where a drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated.\nMilestone and Upfront Expenses\nResearch and development expense for 2019 includes:\n\u2022\n$63.0 million charge to research and development expense upon the completion of a transaction with Samsung Bioepis to secure the exclusive rights to commercialize two potential ophthalmology biosimilar products;\n\u2022\n$45.0 million charge to research and development expense upon the exercise of our option to obtain a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing license from Ionis to develop and commercialize BIIB080; and\n\u2022\n$46.5 million charge to research and development expense consisting of a $38.5 million charge upon the entering into a collaboration and research and development services agreement with Skyhawk and an approximately $8.0 million charge upon entering into an amendment to this agreement to add an additional discovery program.\nResearch and development expense for 2018 includes:\n\u2022\n$486.2 million net charge to research and development expense upon the closing of the 2018 Ionis Agreement; and\n\u2022\n$35.0 million charge to research and development expense upon the exercise of our option to obtain a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing license from Ionis to develop and commercialize tofersen in ALS.\nThese payments are classified as research and development expense as the programs they relate to had not achieved regulatory approval as of the payment date.\nFor additional information about these collaboration arrangements, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nEarly Stage Programs\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the increase in spending related to our early stage programs was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with:\n\u2022\ngosuranemab in PSP and AD pursuant to our license agreement with BMS;\n\u2022\ncinpanemab in Parkinson's disease;\n\u2022\nBIIB112 in XLRP;\n\u2022\nBIIB104 in CIAS;\n\u2022\nBIIB078 (IONIS-C9Rx) in ALS;\n\u2022\nBIIB091 in MS;\n\u2022\nBIIB110 (ActRIIA/B ligand trap) in SMA; and\n\u2022\nour decision in September 2019 to discontinue the Phase 2b study of BG00011 for the potential treatment of IPF, for which we incurred a one-time close out charge of approximately $10.0 million.\nThese increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with:\n\u2022\nthe development of vixotrigine (BIIB074) in trigeminal neuralgia (TGN);\n\u2022\ntofersen in ALS, which was advanced to a late stage program in the first quarter of 2019;\n\u2022\nour decision in December 2018 to discontinue development of BIIB087, an investigational AAV-based gene therapy for the potential treatment of X-linked retinoschisis, and BIIB088, an investigational AAV-based gene therapy for the potential treatment of XLRP, upon the termination of our collaboration agreement with Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation; and\n\u2022\nBIIB093 in LHI, which was advanced to a late stage program in the third quarter of 2018.\nLate Stage Programs\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the decrease in spending associated with our late stage programs was primarily due to a decrease in spending related to the discontinuation of the global Phase 3 trials, ENGAGE and EMERGE, of aducanumab, net of Eisai reimbursement. This decrease was partially offset by increases in spending related to:\n\u2022\nour share of the termination costs of approximately $48.0 million resulting from the decision to discontinue the global Phase 3 studies of elenbecestat in AD;\n\u2022\nBAN2401 in early AD pursuant to our collaboration arrangement with Eisai, which was advanced to a late stage program in the first quarter of 2019;\n\u2022\ntofersen in ALS, which was advanced to a late stage program in the first quarter of 2019;\n\u2022\nBIIB093 in LHI, which was advanced to a late stage program in the third quarter of 2018; and\n\u2022\nBIIB111 in CHM.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased commercial and medical investments as well as the timing of spend on selling, general and administrative expense.\nIn 2020 we expect selling, general and administrative costs, including increases in headcount and other commercial infrastructure, to significantly increase as we support pre-launch activities associated with the potential regulatory approval of aducanumab.\nAmortization and Impairment of Acquired Intangible Assets\nOur amortization expense is based on the economic consumption and impairment of intangible assets. Our most significant intangible assets are related to our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA (rest of world) products\nand other programs acquired through business combinations.\nAmortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2019, was impacted by the 2019 impairment charges of $215.9 million related to certain IPR&D assets associated with the Phase 2b study of BG00011 for the potential treatment of IPF, which was discontinued in the third quarter of 2019.\nAmortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2018, was impacted by the 2018 impairment charges of $189.3 million related to certain IPR&D assets associated with our vixotrigine program and $176.8 million related to our intangible assets associated with our U.S. license to Forward Pharma's intellectual property, including Forward Pharma's intellectual property related to TECFIDERA.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, totaled $274.0 million, $381.2 million and $455.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, was primarily due to a lower rate of amortization for acquired intangible assets, primarily due to prior year impairments.\nWe monitor events and expectations regarding product performance. If new information indicates that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis are substantially different than those utilized in our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenues of the relevant products. The occurrence of an adverse event could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense related to our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations.\nIPR&D related to Business Combinations\nIPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquired as part of a business combination and had not yet reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition. We review amounts capitalized as acquired IPR&D for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate to us that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable.\nBG00011\nDuring the third quarter of 2019 we discontinued the Phase 2b study of BG00011 for the potential treatment of IPF due to safety concerns. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $215.9 million during the third quarter of 2019 to reduce the fair value of the IPR&D intangible asset to zero. We also adjusted the value of our contingent consideration obligations related to this asset resulting in a gain of $61.2 million in the third quarter of 2019.\nVixotrigine\nDuring the third quarter of 2018 we completed a Phase 2b study of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of painful lumbosacral radiculopathy (PLSR). The study did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints and we discontinued development of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of PLSR. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $60.0 million during the third quarter of 2018 to reduce the fair value of the related IPR&D intangible asset to zero.\nIn addition, we delayed the initiation of the Phase 3 studies of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN as we awaited the outcome of ongoing interactions with the FDA regarding the design of the Phase 3 studies, a more detailed review of the data from the Phase 2b study of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of PLSR and insights from the Phase 2 study of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of small fiber neuropathy. We reassessed the fair value of the TGN program using reduced expected lifetime revenues, higher expected clinical development costs and lower cumulative probability of success. As a result of that reassessment, we recognized an impairment charge of $129.3 million during the third quarter of 2018 to reduce the fair value of the TGN IPR&D intangible asset to $41.8 million.\nThe TGN program has experienced numerous delays in development in the periods since we acquired the program and the fair value of this asset is not significantly in excess of carrying value. In addition, we are currently testing vixotrigine in another mid-stage clinical trial, in a different neuropathic pain indication, for which we also have an IPR&D asset. Data from that trial is expected in the first half of 2020. This data may affect the economic value of vixotrigine and the IPR&D assets for one or both programs could be impaired if assumptions used in determining their fair value change.\nOverall, the value of our acquired IPR&D assets is dependent upon several variables, including estimates of future revenues and the effects of competition, our ability to secure sufficient pricing in a competitive market, our ability to confirm safety and\nefficacy based on data from clinical trials and regulatory feedback, the level of anticipated development costs and the probability and timing of successfully advancing a particular research program from one clinical trial phase to the next. We are continually reevaluating our estimates concerning these and other variables, including our life cycle management strategies, research and development priorities and development risk, changes in program and portfolio economics and related impact of foreign currency exchange rates and economic trends and evaluating industry and company data regarding the productivity of clinical research and the development process. Changes in our estimates and prioritization of these programs may result in a significant change to our valuation of our IPR&D assets.\nTECFIDERA License Rights\nIn January 2017 we entered into a settlement and license agreement among Biogen Swiss Manufacturing GmbH, Biogen International Holding Ltd., Forward Pharma and certain related parties, which was effective as of February 1, 2017. Pursuant to this agreement, we obtained U.S. and rest of world licenses to Forward Pharma's intellectual property, including Forward Pharma's intellectual property related to TECFIDERA. In exchange, we paid Forward Pharma $1.25 billion in cash, of which $795.2 million was recorded within intangible assets in the first quarter of 2017.\nWe had an intellectual property dispute with Forward Pharma in the U.S. concerning intellectual property related to TECFIDERA.\nIn March 2017 the U.S. intellectual property dispute was decided in our favor. Forward Pharma appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We evaluated the recoverability of the U.S. asset acquired from Forward Pharma and recorded a $328.2 million impairment charge in the first quarter of 2017 to adjust the carrying value of the acquired U.S. asset to fair value reflecting the impact of the developments in the U.S. legal dispute and continued to amortize the remaining net book value of the U.S. intangible asset in our consolidated statements of income utilizing an economic consumption model. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the USPTO's March 2017 ruling and in January 2019 denied Forward Pharma\u2019s petition for rehearing. We evaluated the recoverability of the U.S. asset based upon these most recent developments and recorded a $176.8 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 to reduce the remaining net book value of the U.S. asset to zero.\nWe have an intellectual property dispute with Forward Pharma in the E.U. concerning intellectual property related to TECFIDERA.\nIn March 2018 the European Patent Office (EPO) revoked Forward Pharma\u2019s European Patent No. 2 801 355. Forward Pharma has filed an appeal to the Technical Boards of Appeal of the EPO and a hearing has been set for June 2020. Based upon our assessment of this ruling, we continue to amortize the remaining net book value of the rest of world intangible asset in our consolidated statements of income utilizing an economic consumption model. The remaining net book value of the TECFIDERA rest of world intangible asset as of December 31, 2019, was $36.1 million.\nFor additional information on the dispute with Forward Pharma in the E.U., please read Note 20, Litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFor additional information on the amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets, please read Note 6, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCollaboration Profit (Loss) Sharing\nCollaboration profit (loss) sharing primarily includes Samsung Bioepis' 50% share of the profit or loss related to our biosimilars commercial agreement with Samsung Bioepis.\nFor 2019, 2018 and 2017 we recognized a net profit-sharing expense of $241.6 million, $187.4 million and $111.0 million, respectively, to reflect Samsung Bioepis\u2019 50% sharing of the net collaboration profits. The increases in profit-sharing expense for the comparative periods were primarily due to increased collaboration profits resulting from increased biosimilar sales.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nLoss on Divestiture of Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark Manufacturing Operations\nDivestiture of Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark Manufacturing Operations\nIn August 2019 we completed the sale of all of the outstanding shares of our subsidiary that owned our biologics manufacturing operations in Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark to FUJIFILM. Upon the closing of this transaction, we received approximately $881.9 million in cash, which may be adjusted based on other contractual terms, which are discussed below. We determined that the operations disposed of in this transaction did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations under the applicable guidance.\nAs part of this transaction, we have provided FUJIFILM with certain minimum batch production commitment guarantees. There is a risk that the minimum contractual batch production commitments will not be met. Based upon current estimates we expect to incur an adverse commitment obligation of approximately $74.0 million associated with such guarantees and have accrued for this obligation. We may adjust this estimate based upon changes in business conditions, which may result in the increase or reduction of this adverse commitment obligation in subsequent periods. We also may be obligated to indemnify FUJIFILM for liabilities that existed relating to certain business activities incurred prior to the closing of this transaction.\nIn addition, we may earn certain contingent payments based on future manufacturing activities at the Hiller\u00f8d facility. For the disposition of a business, our policy is to recognize contingent consideration when the consideration is realizable. We currently believe the probability of earning these payments is remote and therefore we did not include these contingent payments in our calculation of the fair value of the operations.\nAs part of this transaction, we entered into certain manufacturing services agreements with FUJIFILM pursuant to which FUJIFILM will use the Hiller\u00f8d facility to produce commercial products for us, such as TYSABRI, as well as other third-party products.\nIn connection with this transaction, we recognized a total net loss of approximately $164.4 million in our consolidated statements of income. This loss included a pre-tax loss of $95.5 million, which was recorded in loss on divestiture of Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations. The loss recognized was based on exchange rates and business conditions on the closing date of this transaction, and included costs to sell our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations of approximately $11.2 million and our estimate of the fair value of an adverse commitment of approximately $114.0 million associated with the guarantee of future minimum batch production at the Hiller\u00f8d facility. The value of this adverse commitment was determined using a probability-weighted estimate of future manufacturing activity. We also recorded a tax expense of $68.9 million related to this transaction. During the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded a $40.2 million reduction in our estimate of the future minimum batch commitment utilizing our current manufacturing forecast, which reflects the impact of forecasted aducanumab batches, resulting in a reduction in the pre-tax loss on divestiture from $95.5 million to $55.3 million.\nOur estimate of the fair value of the adverse commitment is a Level 3 measurement and is based on forecasted batch production at the Hiller\u00f8d facility.\nFor additional information on the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations, please read Note 3, Divestitures, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n(Gain) Loss on Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration\nConsideration payable for certain of our business combinations includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. We record an obligation for such contingent consideration payments at fair value on the acquisition date. We then revalue our contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration in our consolidated statements of income.\nThe gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for 2019 was primarily due to the discontinuation of the Phase 2b study of BG00011 for the potential treatment of IPF, partially offset by changes in the probability and expected timing of achievement of certain developmental milestones, a decrease in interest rates used to revalue our contingent consideration liabilities and the passage of time.\nThe gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for 2018 was primarily due to delays in the expected timing of achievement of milestones related to our vixotrigine program for the potential treatment of TGN and an increase in discount rates used to revalue our contingent consideration liabilities, partially offset by the passage of time.\nThe loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration for 2017 was primarily due to the increase in the probability of achieving certain developmental milestones based upon the progression of the underlying clinical programs.\nFor additional information on our IPR&D intangible assets related to our discontinued BG00011 program for the potential treatment of IPF and our vixotrigine program for the potential treatment of TGN, please read Note 6, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development\nBIIB110 Acquisition\nIn July 2018 we acquired BIIB110 and ALG-802 from AliveGen Inc. (AliveGen). BIIB110 and ALG-802 represent novel ways of targeting the myostatin pathway. In connection with the closing of this transaction, we made an upfront payment of $27.5 million to AliveGen, which was recorded as acquired IPR&D in our consolidated statements of income as BIIB110 has not yet reached technological feasibility.\nBIIB104 Acquisition\nIn April 2018 we acquired BIIB104 from Pfizer. BIIB104 is a first-in-class, Phase 2b AMPA receptor potentiator for CIAS. In connection with the closing of this transaction, we made an upfront payment of $75.0 million to Pfizer, which was recorded as acquired IPR&D in our consolidated statements of income as BIIB104 has not yet reached technological feasibility.\nBIIB100 Acquisition\nIn January 2018 we acquired BIIB100 from Kayropharm Therapeutics Inc. (Karyopharm). BIIB100 is a Phase 1 investigational oral compound for the treatment of certain neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, primarily in ALS. In connection with the closing of this transaction, we made an upfront payment of $10.0 million to Karyopharm, which was recorded as acquired IPR&D in our consolidated statements of income as BIIB100 has not yet reached technological feasibility.\nBIIB093 Acquisition\nIn May 2017 we acquired BIIB093 from Remedy Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Remedy). In connection with the closing of this transaction, we made an upfront payment of $120.0 million to Remedy, which was\nrecorded as acquired IPR&D in our consolidated statements of income as BIIB093 had not yet reached technological feasibility.\nFor additional information on our acquisitions of BIIB110, BIIB104, BIIB100 and BIIB093, please read Note 2, Acquisitions, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nEffective January 1, 2018, other income (expense) reflects the recognition of net gains (losses) recorded in relation to changes in the fair value of our strategic investments following our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Prior to the adoption of this standard, we recognized changes in fair value of our strategic investment in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net. Changes in the fair value of our strategic investments could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the change in other income (expense), net primarily reflects net gains totaling $204.7 million recognized on our investments related to our holdings in equity and debt securities, compared to net gains totaling $119.5 million in 2018. The net gains recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflect an increase in the fair value in our investment in Ionis common stock from December 31, 2018, partially offset by the net loss recognized on our sale of a portion of our investment in Ionis common stock during the second and third quarters of 2019 reflecting the decrease in the fair value of the shares sold from March 31, 2019.\nProceeds from our sale of a portion of our investment in Ionis common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019, totaled approximately\n$382.0 million. The original cost basis upon acquisition in June 2018 for the shares sold during the year ended December 31, 2019, totaled approximately $312.5 million.\nNet gains recognized on our investments related to our holdings in equity and debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2019, also reflects an increase in the fair value of an investment in a non-marketable equity security from December 31, 2018, that was realized for a net gain of approximately $87.7 million upon sale in the second quarter of 2019.\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include changes in tax laws, variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions, the amount and characterization of our research and development expenses, the levels of certain deductions and credits, acquisitions and licensing transactions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018, the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the combination of the internal reorganization of certain intellectual property rights and the impact of Swiss Tax Reform. This decrease was partially offset by a $68.9 million tax expense related to the divestiture of our subsidiary that owned our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations. We also had a higher effective tax rate in 2018 resulting from the unfavorable effects of the 2017 Tax Act and our sale of inventory, the tax effect of which had been included within prepaid taxes at\nJanuary 1, 2018, at a higher effective tax rate than the 2018 statutory tax rate.\nFor additional information on the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations, please read Note 3, Divestitures, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nFor additional information on our uncertain tax positions and income tax rate reconciliation for 2019, 2018 and 2017, please read Note 16, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nEquity in Loss of Investee, Net of Tax\nIn February 2012 we entered into a joint venture agreement with Samsung BioLogics, establishing an entity, Samsung Bioepis, to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar products.\nIn June 2018 we exercised our option under our joint venture agreement to increase our ownership percentage in Samsung Bioepis from approximately 5% to approximately 49.9%. The share purchase transaction was completed in November 2018 and, upon closing, we paid 759.5 billion South Korean won ($676.6 million) to Samsung BioLogics. As of December 31, 2019, our ownership percentage remained at approximately 49.9%\nWe recognize our share of the results of operations related to our investment in Samsung Bioepis under the equity method of accounting one quarter in arrears when the results of the entity become available, which is reflected as equity in income (loss) of investee, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income. During 2015, as our share of losses exceeded the carrying value of our investment, we suspended recognizing additional losses. In the first quarter of 2019 we restarted recognizing our share of Samsung Bioepis' income (losses), and we began recognizing amortization on\ncertain basis differences resulting from our November 2018 investment.\nOur joint venture partner, Samsung BioLogics, is currently subject to an ongoing criminal investigation that we continue to monitor. While this investigation could impact the operations of Samsung Bioepis and its business, we have assessed the value of our investment in Samsung Bioepis and continue to believe that the fair value of the investment is in excess of its net book value.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, equity in loss of investee, net of tax reflects our share of losses totaling $1.2 million and amortization of basis differences totaling $78.2 million.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nNoncontrolling Interests, Net of Tax\nFor 2018 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax, was primarily related to a $50.0 million pre-tax payment made to Neurimmune to reduce the previously negotiated royalty rates payable on products developed under the Neurimmune Agreement, including royalties payable on potential commercial sales of aducanumab, by 5%.\nFor 2017 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax, was primarily related to a $150.0 million pre-tax payment made to Neurimmune to reduce the previously negotiated royalty rates payable on products developed under the Neurimmune Agreement, including royalties payable on potential commercial sales of aducanumab, by 15%.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangement with Neurimmune, please read Note 19, Investments in Variable Interest Entities, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financial condition is summarized as follows:\n** Percentage not meaningful.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, certain significant cash flows were as follows:\n\u2022\n$7.1 billion in net cash flows provided by operating activities, net of:\n\u25e6\n$1.1 billion in total net payments for income taxes; and\n\u25e6\n$74.0 million upfront payment made to Skyhawk upon entering into a collaboration and research and development services agreement;\n\u2022\n$5.9 billion used for share repurchases;\n\u2022\n$923.7 million in proceeds received on the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations, including the sale of raw materials that were remaining at the Hiller\u00f8d facility on the closing date of this transaction;\n\u2022\n$744.4 million payment made for our acquisition of NST, net of cash acquired;\n\u2022\n$479.3 million in proceeds received on sales of strategic investments;\n\u2022\n$514.5 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment;\n\u2022\n$300.0 million for the final contingent payment made to former shareholders of Fumapharm AG and holders of their rights; and\n\u2022\n$155.0 million in payments made to Alkermes following the FDA's approval of VUMERITY.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, certain significant cash flows were as follows:\n\u2022\n$6.2 billion in net cash flows provided by operating activities, net of:\n\u25e6\n$1.0 billion in total net payments for income taxes; and\n\u25e6\n$375.0 million in an upfront payment made to Ionis upon the closing of the 2018 Ionis Agreement and a $162.1 million expense reflecting the premium paid for the purchase of Ionis common stock;\n\u2022\n$4.4 billion used for share repurchases;\n\u2022\n$1.5 billion in contingent payments made to former shareholders of Fumapharm AG and holders of their rights;\n\u2022\n$770.6 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment;\n\u2022\n$676.6 million payment made to Samsung BioLogics upon the closing of the share purchase transaction increasing our ownership percentage in Samsung Bioepis to approximately 49.9%;\n\u2022\n$462.9 million payment made to Ionis reflecting the fair value of the Ionis common stock purchased upon the closing the 2018 Ionis Agreement; and\n\u2022\n$112.5 million in payments made for the acquisitions of BIIB100, BIIB104 and BIIB110.\nOverview\nWe have historically financed our operating and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows earned through our operations. We expect our operating expenditures, particularly those related to research and development, clinical trials, commercialization of new products and international expansion to continue to grow. However, we expect to continue funding our current and planned operating requirements principally through our cash flows from operations, as well as our existing cash resources. We believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to additional financing resources, if needed, are sufficient to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic alliance, milestone payment, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition and licensing activities. We may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources should we identify a significant new opportunity.\nAducanumab\nIn October 2019 we and our collaboration partner Eisai announced that we plan to pursue regulatory approval for aducanumab in the U.S. We plan to actively commit funds to developing our commercialization program for aducanumab so that we would be in a position to launch aducanumab if we receive regulatory approval. If we do not receive regulatory approval or are unable to successfully commercialize aducanumab, our financial condition, business and operations may be adversely affected.\nFor additional information on certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this report.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nUntil required for another use in our business, we typically invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. and foreign government instruments, overnight reverse repurchase agreements and other interest-bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. It is our policy to mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $5.9 billion compared to approximately $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2018. The net increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2019, from December 31, 2018, was primarily due to cash flows from operations, cash received upon the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations, net proceeds from marketable securities and proceeds from sales of strategic investments, partially offset by cash used for share repurchases, cash used for our acquisition of NST, net purchases of property, plant and equipment, contingent payments made to former shareholders of Fumapharm AG and holders of their rights and upfront and milestone payments made to Alkermes and Skyhawk.\nInvestments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, includes the carrying value of our investment in Samsung Bioepis of $580.2 million and $680.6 million, respectively. As Samsung Bioepis is a privately-held entity, our ability to liquidate our investment in Samsung Bioepis may be limited and we may realize significantly less than the value of such investment. Investments in other assets, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, also includes the fair value of our investment in Ionis common stock of $329.6 million and $563.8 million, respectively, which is subject to certain holding period restrictions.\nFor additional information on our acquisition of NST, please read Note 2, Acquisitions, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. For additional information on the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations, please read Note 3, Divestitures, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. For additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Ionis, Samsung Bioepis, Alkermes and Skyhawk, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nBorrowings\nThe following is a summary of our principal indebtedness as of December 31, 2019:\n\u2022\n$1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.90% Senior Notes due September 15, 2020;\n\u2022\n$1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due September 15, 2022;\n\u2022\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.05% Senior Notes due September 15, 2025; and\n\u2022\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.20% Senior Notes due September 15, 2045.\nThese Senior Notes were issued at discount and are amortized as additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity.\nFor a summary of the fair values of our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, please read Note 7, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n2015 Credit Facility\nIn August 2015 we entered into a $1.0 billion, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we were permitted to draw funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. The terms of the revolving credit facility included a financial covenant that required us not to exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all covenants under this facility. This credit facility was replaced with the new revolving credit facility entered into in January 2020, as discussed below.\n2020 Credit Facility\nIn January 2020 we entered into a $1.0 billion, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we are permitted to draw funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. The terms of the revolving credit facility include a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. This revolving credit facility replaced the revolving credit facility entered into in August 2015.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. The change in working capital at December 31, 2019, from December 31, 2018, reflects an increase in total current assets of $740.9 million and an increase in total current liabilities of $1,568.6 million.\nThe net increase in total current assets was primarily driven by an increase in net cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as described above, offset by a decrease in inventory resulting from our sale of hemophilia-related inventory to Bioverativ.\nThe net increase in total current liabilities was primarily due to the reclassification of $1.5 billion of our Senior Notes to current liabilities from notes payable, as these Senior Notes are due within one year. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in accrued expenses and other.\nThe net decrease in accrued expenses and other was primarily related to a decrease in the accrual of contingent payments related to FUMADERM and TECFIDERA and a decrease in the accrual for construction in progress, partially offset by the accrual of the $100.0 million upfront payment to Samsung Bioepis, which was paid in January 2020.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nIn December 2019 our Board of Directors authorized our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program, which is a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock. Our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. All share repurchases under our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program will be retired. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock under our December 2019 Share Repurchase Program during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn March 2019 our Board of Directors authorized our March 2019 Share Repurchase Program, which is a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock. Our March 2019 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. All share repurchases under our March 2019 Share Repurchase Program will be retired. Under our March 2019 Share Repurchase Program, we repurchased and retired approximately 14.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $3.7 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn August 2018 our Board of Directors authorized our 2018 Share Repurchase Program, which was a program to repurchase up to $3.5 billion of our common stock. Our 2018 Share Repurchase Program was completed as of June 30, 2019. All share repurchases under our 2018 Share Repurchase Program were retired. Under our 2018 Share Repurchase Program, we repurchased and retired approximately 8.9 million and 4.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn July 2016 our Board of Directors authorized our 2016 Share Repurchase Program, which was a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock. Our 2016 Share Repurchase Program was completed as of June 30, 2018. All share repurchases under our 2016 Share Repurchase Program were retired. Under our 2016 Share Repurchase Program, we repurchased and retired approximately 10.5 million and 3.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $3.0 billion and $1.0 billion during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity:\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. We expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.\nOperating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for:\n\u2022\nnon-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, unrealized gain (loss) on strategic investments, acquired IPR&D and share-based compensation;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair value of contingent payments associated with our acquisitions of businesses and payments related to collaborations.\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, net cash flows provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher net income.\nInvesting Activities\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the increase in net cash flows provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in contingent payments made to former shareholders of Fumapharm AG and holders of their rights, the proceeds received upon the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations, the proceeds received on our sales of strategic investments and the $462.9 million payment made to Ionis reflecting the fair value of the Ionis common stock purchased upon the closing of the 2018 Ionis Agreement in the prior year comparative period. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds related to marketable securities, the cash used for our acquisition of NST and $155.0 million in milestone payments made to Alkermes following the FDA's approval of VUMERITY, which was recorded as an intangible asset during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nFor 2019 compared to 2018, the increase in net cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash used for share repurchases.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019, excluding amounts related to uncertain tax positions, funding commitments, contingent development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, contingent payments and contingent consideration related to our business combinations, as described below.\n(1)\nWe lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. Amounts reflected within the table above detail future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31 for each of the periods presented. In addition to the minimum rental commitments, these leases may require us to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses.\n(2)\nObligations are presented net of sublease income expected to be received for the vacated small-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Cambridge, MA, the vacated portion of our Weston, MA facility and other facilities throughout the world.\n(3)\nLong-term debt obligations are related to our Senior Notes, including principal and interest payments.\n(4)\nPurchase and other obligations primarily include $697.0 million related to the remaining payments on the Transition Toll Tax, contractual commitments to our suppliers, $52.0 million in contractual commitments for the construction of our large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland and $8.3 million related to the fair value of net liabilities on derivative contracts.\nRoyalty Payments\nTYSABRI\nIn 2013 we acquired from Elan Pharma International Ltd. (Elan), an affiliate of Elan Corporation plc, full ownership of all remaining rights to TYSABRI that we did not already own or control. Under the acquisition agreement, we are obligated to make contingent payments to Elan of 18% on annual worldwide net commercial sales up to $2.0 billion and\n25% on annual worldwide net commercial sales that exceed $2.0 billion. Royalty payments to Elan and other third parties are recognized as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Elan was acquired by Perrigo Company plc (Perrigo) in December 2013 and Perrigo subsequently sold its rights to these payments to a third-party effective January 2017.\nSPINRAZA\nIn 2016 we exercised our option to develop and commercialize SPINRAZA from Ionis. Under our agreement with Ionis, we make royalty payments to Ionis on annual worldwide net commercial sales of SPINRAZA using a tiered royalty rate between 11% and 15%, which are recorded as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. For additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Ionis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nVUMERITY\nIn October 2019 the FDA approved VUMERITY for the treatment of RMS. Under our agreement with Alkermes, we make royalty payments to Alkermes on worldwide net commercial sales of VUMERITY using a royalty rate of 15%, which are recorded as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Royalties payable on net commercial sales of VUMERITY are subject, under certain circumstances, to tiered minimum annual payment requirements for a period of five years following FDA approval. For additional information on our collaboration arrangement with Alkermes, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nContingent Consideration related to Business Combinations\nIn connection with our acquisitions of Convergence Pharmaceuticals Holdings Limited (Convergence) and Biogen International Neuroscience GmbH (BIN), we agreed to make additional payments based upon the achievement of certain milestone events.\nAs the acquisitions of Convergence and BIN occurred after January 1, 2009, we recognized the contingent consideration liabilities associated with these transactions at their fair value on the acquisition date and revalue the remaining obligations each reporting period. We may pay up to approximately $735.0 million in remaining milestones related to these acquisitions.\nFumapharm AG\nIn 2006 we acquired Fumapharm AG. As part of this acquisition we acquired FUMADERM and TECFIDERA (together, the Fumapharm Products). We were required to make contingent payments to former shareholders of Fumapharm AG and holders of their rights based on the attainment of certain cumulative sales levels of Fumapharm Products and the level of total net sales of Fumapharm Products in the prior 12-month period, as defined in the acquisition agreement, until such time as the cumulative sales level reached $20.0 billion, at which time no further contingent payments were due. During the first quarter of 2019 we paid the final $300.0 million contingent payment as we achieved the $20.0 billion cumulative sales level related to the Fumapharm Products in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nContingent Development, Regulatory and Commercial Milestone Payments\nBased on our development plans as of December 31, 2019, we could make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $6.8 billion, including approximately $1.2 billion in development milestones, approximately $1.4 billion in regulatory milestones and approximately $4.2 billion in commercial milestones, as part of our various collaborations, including licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones was not considered probable as of December 31, 2019, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones.\nProvided various development, regulatory or commercial milestones are achieved, we anticipate that we may pay approximately $430.0 million of milestone payments in 2020, including $75.0 million upon the regulatory filing with the FDA for approval of aducanumab and $100.0 million if aducanumab is launched in the U.S.\nOther Funding Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have several ongoing clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. We recorded accrued expenses of approximately $24.0 million in our consolidated balance sheet for expenditures incurred by CROs as of December 31, 2019. We have approximately $514.0 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts as of December 31, 2019.\nAs part of the sale of our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark manufacturing operations to FUJIFILM, we have provided FUJIFILM with certain minimum batch production commitment guarantees. There is a risk that the minimum contractual batch production commitments will not be met. Based upon current estimates we expect to incur an adverse commitment obligation of approximately $74.0 million associated with such guarantees and have accrued for this obligation. We may adjust this estimate based upon changes in business conditions, which may result in the increase or reduction of this adverse commitment obligation in subsequent periods.\nTax Related Obligations\nWe exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2019, we have $136.9 million of net liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we have accrued income tax liabilities of $697.0 million under the Transition Toll Tax. Of the amounts accrued as of December 31, 2019, no amounts are expected to be paid within one year due to an approximately $87.0 million carryforward of taxes paid in relation to the company's 2017 tax return. The Transition Toll Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, which started in 2018, and will not accrue interest. For additional information on the Transition Toll Tax, please read Note 16, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of new accounting standards and their expected impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures, please read Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nLegal Matters\nFor a discussion of legal matters as of December 31, 2019, please read Note 20, Litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and methodologies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Other significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenues following the five-step model prescribed under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProduct Revenues\nIn the U.S., we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors and specialty pharmacy providers. In other countries, we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, hospitals, pharmacies and other third-party distribution partners. These customers subsequently resell our products to health care providers and patients. In addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government-mandated or privately-negotiated discounts and allowances related to our products.\nProduct revenues are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nReserves for Discounts and Allowances\nProduct revenues are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers, health care providers or payors, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate. Our process for estimating reserves established for these variable consideration components do not differ materially from our historical practices.\nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns.\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Our estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon a consistent application of our methodology utilizing the expected value method. These estimates reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The transaction price, which includes\nvariable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nIn addition to discounts, rebates and product returns, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally reflected as a reduction of revenues. To the extent we can demonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services we classify these payments in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFor additional information on our revenues, please read Note 4, Revenues, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nAcquired Intangible Assets, including IPR&D\nWhen we purchase a business, the acquired IPR&D is measured at fair value, capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually, as of October 31, until commercialization, after which time the IPR&D is amortized over its estimated useful life. If we acquire an asset or group of assets that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards, the acquired IPR&D is expensed on its acquisition date. Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to research and development expense as they are incurred.\nWe have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, we generally engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nestimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects;\n\u2022\nprojecting regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nestimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project.\nWe believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.\nIf these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated.\nImpairment and Amortization of Long-lived Assets and Accounting for Goodwill\nLong-lived Assets Other than Goodwill\nLong-lived assets to be held and used include property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets, including IPR&D and trademarks. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We review our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nWhen performing our impairment assessment, we calculate the fair value using the same methodology as described above under Acquired Intangible Assets, including IPR&D. If the carrying value of our acquired IPR&D exceeds its fair value, then the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our acquired IPR&D could result in an impairment. Impairments are recorded within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income. Assets that have previously been impaired, including our vixotrigine program for the treatment of neuropathic pain, such as TGN, could become further impaired in the future.\nOur most significant intangible assets are our acquired and in-licensed rights and patents. Acquired and in-licensed rights and patents primarily relate to our acquisition of all remaining rights to TYSABRI from\nElan and obtaining the fair value of the U.S. and rest of world licenses to Forward Pharma\u2019s intellectual property, including Forward Pharma\u2019s intellectual property related to TECFIDERA. We amortize the intangible assets related to our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA (rest of world) products using the economic consumption method based on revenues generated from the products underlying the related intangible assets. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenues of TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA (rest of world) is performed annually during our long-range planning cycle and whenever events or changes in circumstances would significantly affect the anticipated lifetime revenues of our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY or TECFIDERA (rest of world) products.\nFor additional information on the impairment charges related to our long-lived assets during 2019, 2018 and 2017, please read Note 6, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill relates largely to amounts that arose in connection with the merger of Biogen, Inc. and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation in 2003 and amounts that were paid in connection with the acquisition of Fumapharm AG. Our goodwill balances represent the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.\nWe assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. We compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.\nWe completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarters of 2019, 2018 and 2017 and determined in each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired. In each year, the fair value of our reporting unit, which includes goodwill, was significantly in excess of the carrying value of our reporting unit.\nContingent Consideration\nWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we\nrevalue the remaining obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense in our consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates and achievement and timing of any cumulative sales-based and development milestones or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market.\nSignificant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, changes in assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction\u2019s tax laws and regulations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon our election in the fourth quarter of 2018 to record deferred taxes for GILTI, we have included amounts related to U.S. GILTI taxes within temporary difference. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions using a \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d threshold for recognizing and\nresolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished, through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. We consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews, we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re-examine the related tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are subject to certain risks that may affect our results of operations, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities, including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate movements, pricing pressures worldwide and weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate. We manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate lock contracts and interest rate swap contracts. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions, and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. As a result, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Japanese yen and South Korean won.\nWhile the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in ways that are difficult to predict. In particular, as the U.S. dollar strengthens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenues will decline when reported in U.S. dollars. The impact to net income as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar will be partially mitigated by the value of non-U.S. expenses, which will also decline when reported in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenues and expenses will increase when reported in U.S. dollars.\nWe have established revenue and operating expense hedging and balance sheet risk management programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018 the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality categorized Argentina as a country with a projected three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100%, which indicated that Argentina\u2019s economy is highly inflationary. This categorization did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position as of December 31, 2019, and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position in the future.\nRevenue and Operating Expense Hedging Program\nOur foreign currency hedging program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact resulting from volatility in exchange rate changes on revenues and operating expenses. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk, with the majority of our forward contracts used to hedge certain forecasted revenue and operating expense transactions denominated in foreign currencies in the next 15 months. We do not engage in currency speculation. For a more detailed disclosure of our revenue and operating expense hedging program, please read Note 9, Derivative Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOur ability to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenues and net income diminishes as significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are sustained over extended periods of time. In particular, devaluation or significant deterioration of foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to mitigate and likely to negatively impact earnings. The cash flows from these contracts\nare reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nBalance Sheet Risk Management Hedging Program\nWe also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items. The primary objective of our balance sheet risk management program is to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency denominated net monetary assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates. In these instances, we principally utilize currency forward contracts. We have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in our revenue, operating expense and balance sheet hedging programs. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a hypothetical adverse 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately $265.0 million and $290.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair value change was determined by measuring the impact of the hypothetical exchange rate movement on outstanding forward contracts. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments is subject to assumptions and actual impact could be significantly different. The quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions.\nNet Investment Hedge Program\nOur net investment hedging program is designed to mitigate currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and South Korean won as a result of exercising our option to increase our ownership percentage in Samsung Bioepis to approximately 49.9%. We entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign currency risk with our forward contracts used to hedge changes in the spot rate over the next 10 months. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a hypothetical adverse 10% movement would result in a hypothetical decrease in fair value of approximately $43.0 million and $64.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was determined by measuring the impact of the hypothetical spot rate movement on outstanding forward contracts.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments. The fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market\ninterest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we estimate that such hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $21.0 million and $19.0 million, respectively, to our interest rate sensitive instruments. The fair values of our investments were determined using third-party pricing services or other market observable data.\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts during 2015 for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These derivative contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a 100 basis-point adverse movement (increase in LIBOR) would increase annual interest expense by approximately $6.8 million.\nPricing Pressure\nGovernments in certain international markets in which we operate have implemented measures, and may in the future implement new or additional measures, to reduce health care costs to limit the overall level of government expenditures. These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possible retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. In addition, certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, our inability to obtain and maintain adequate prices in a particular country may adversely affect our ability to secure acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets, which may limit market growth. The continued implementation of pricing actions throughout Europe may also lead to higher levels of parallel trade.\nIn the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals, enactments to reform health care insurance programs and increasing pressure from social sources could significantly influence the way our products are prescribed and purchased. It is possible that additional federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, which could result in increased pricing pressure and reduced reimbursement for our products and otherwise have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. There is also\nsignificant economic pressure on state budgets that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. Managed care organizations are also continuing to seek price discounts and, in some cases, impose restrictions on the coverage of certain drugs.\nOur products are also susceptible to increasing competition in many markets from generic versions, biosimilars and prodrugs of existing products as well as products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products. Accordingly, the introduction of such products, as well as other lower-priced competing products, may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which will negatively impact our revenues. In addition, when a generic version of one of our products is commercialized, it may, in some cases, be automatically substituted for our product and reduce our revenues in a short period of time.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the U.S. and Europe with concentrations of credit risk limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using our products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. Our accounts receivable are primarily due from wholesale and other third-party distributors, public hospitals, pharmacies and other government entities. We monitor the financial performance and creditworthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. We operate in certain countries where weakness in economic conditions can result in extended collection periods. We continue to monitor these conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies and the relevant financial markets, and assess their possible impact on our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable.\nWe believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. However, if significant changes occur in the availability of government funding or the reimbursement practices of these or other governments, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from customers in such countries and our results of operations could be adversely affected.",

Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nControls and Procedures\nWe have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of December 31, 2019. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company\u2019s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n\u2022\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\u2022\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework.\nBased on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein.",
