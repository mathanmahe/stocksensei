    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nON Semiconductor Corporation, together with its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, which operate under the onsemiTM brand (\"onsemi,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" or the \"Company\"), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1992.\nWe provide intelligent power and intelligent sensing solutions with a primary focus towards automotive and industrial markets to help our customers solve challenging problems and create cutting-edge products for a better future. Our intelligent power technologies enable the electrification of the automotive industry that allows for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles, empowers efficient fast-charging systems and propels sustainable energy for the highest efficiency solar strings, industrial power and storage systems. Our intelligent power solutions for the automotive industry allow our customers to exceed range targets with lower weight and reduce system cost through efficiency. Our intelligent sensing technologies support the next generation industry, allowing for smarter factories and buildings while also enhancing the automotive mobility experience with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible.\nWe believe the evolution of the automotive industry, with advancements in autonomous driving, ADAS, vehicle electrification, and the increase in electronics content for vehicle platforms, is reshaping the boundaries of transportation. Through sensing integration, we believe our intelligent power solutions achieve superior efficiencies compared to our peers. This integration allows lower temperature operation and reduced cooling requirements while saving costs and minimizing weight. In addition, our power solutions deliver power with less die per module, achieving higher range for a given battery capacity.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were organized into the following three operating and reportable segments: the Power Solutions Group (\"PSG\"), the Advanced Solutions Group (\"ASG\") and the Intelligent Sensing Group (\"ISG\").\nBusiness Strategy Developments\nOur primary focus continues to be on profitable revenue and operating income growth by capturing high-growth megatrends in our focused end-markets of automotive and industrial infrastructure. We are designing products in highly-differentiated markets focused on customer needs while optimizing our manufacturing footprint to support growth and maintain gross margins through efficiencies and new product development.\nWe are focused on achieving efficiencies in our operating and capital expenditures, capital allocation on research and development investments and resources to accelerate growth in high-margin products and end-markets. During the year, we ramped up manufacturing at our EFK location, as well as expanded our capacity in Hudson, New Hampshire, Roznov, the Czech Republic, and Bucheon, South Korea to increase our SiC manufacturing capabilities to meet the growing demand for our SiC-based solutions.\nBusiness Realignment\nDuring 2023, we realigned our operating models in ASG, Corporate information technology (\"IT\") organization and certain manufacturing locations in order to streamline our operations, achieve organizational efficiencies and consolidate resources into fewer, common sites across the world to align with the next phase of our multi-year \"Fab Right\" manufacturing strategy. Under these business realignment efforts, approximately 1,900 employees were notified of their employment termination. We incurred severance and related charges of approximately $59.1 million related to these actions in 2023.\n2023 Financing activities\n0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029\nOn February 28, 2023, we completed the offering of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% Notes and utilized the net proceeds along with cash generated from operations to (i) repay $1,086.0 million of the outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan \u201cB\u201d Facility and the related transaction fees and expenses, (ii) pay $171.5 million net cost of the related convertible note hedges after such costs were offset by the proceeds from the sale of warrants, and (iii) for general corporate purposes.\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn June 22, 2023, we entered into the New Credit Agreement to replace the Revolver due 2024, which was maturing on June 28, 2024. We drew $375.0 million against the Revolving Credit Facility and repaid the entire outstanding balance under the Revolver due 2024. We had previously repaid $125.0 million of the outstanding balance under the Revolver due 2024 during the first quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $1.1 billion available under the Revolving Credit Facility for future borrowings.\n1.625% Notes maturity and repayment\nOn October 16, 2023, we repaid $119.6 million of the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 1.625% Notes in cash and settled the excess over the principal amount by issuing 4.5 million shares of our common stock. Under the previously executed bond hedge agreements, we also repurchased an equivalent number of shares of our common stock for no additional consideration, to effectively offset the issuance of shares.\nSee Note 7: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, net'' and Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information related to our restructuring efforts and financing activities.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures during 2021 and 2022\nOn October 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (\"GTAT\"), a producer of SiC substrates. The purchase price for the acquisition was $434.9 million, which included cash consideration of $424.6 million and effective settlement of pre-acquisition balances (non-cash) of approximately $10.0 million, in exchange for all of the outstanding equity interests of GTAT.\nOn December 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the manufacturing facility at EFK along with certain other assets and liabilities from GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. (\"GFUS\") for total consideration of $406.3 million. We paid GFUS $236.3 million, $100.0 million and $70.0 million during 2023, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring 2022, in line with our business strategy, we divested four wafer manufacturing facilities in Oudenaarde, Belgium, South Portland, Maine, Pocatello, Idaho and Niigata, Japan. We entered into wafer supply agreements with the respective buyers of these facilities to help minimize disruptions in our ability to meet customer demand for our products.\nSee Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\nRevenue-Generating Activities\nonsemi generates revenue from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors and direct customers. We also generate revenue, to a much lesser extent, from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products, combined with our global manufacturing and logistics network, provides our customers with single source purchasing.\nThe following table illustrates the product technologies under each of our segments based on our operating strategy:\nSee Note 3: ''Revenue and Segment Information'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K for other information regarding our segments, their revenue and property, plant and equipment and the gross profit derived from each segment.\nProducts and Technology\nThe following provides certain information regarding the products and technologies for each of our operating segments.\nPSG\nPSG offers a wide array of analog, discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products that perform multiple application functions, including power switching, power conversion, signal conditioning, circuit protection, signal amplification and voltage regulation functions. The trends driving growth within our end-user markets are primarily higher power efficiency and power density in power applications, the demand for greater functionality, and faster data transmission rates in all communications. The advancement of existing volt electrical infrastructure, electrification of power train in the form of EV/HEV, higher trench density enabling lower losses in power efficient packages and lower capacitance and integrated signal conditioning products to support faster data transmission rates significantly increase the use of high-power semiconductor solutions. The recent increase in the use of WBG MOSFETs and diodes, including SiC and IGBT, is further expanding the use of semiconductor products.\nASG\nASG designs and develops analog, mixed-signal, Power Management ICs and Sensor Interface devices for a broad base of end-users in the Automotive, Industrial, Compute and Mobile end-markets. We implement a platform-based design approach to rapidly proliferate product portfolios.

Our broad range of product offerings delivers excellent pixel performance, sensor functionality and camera systems capabilities in which high quality visual imagery is becoming increasingly important to our customers and their end-users, particularly in automotive and factory automation and in applications powered by AI.\nCustomers\nWe sell our products to distributors and direct customers for ultimate use in a variety of end-products in different end-markets. In general, we have maintained long-term relationships with our key customers and our sales agreements are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. During 2023, we continued to enter into long-term supply agreements with certain strategic end-customers, which generally include minimum purchase commitments or amended existing terms based on mutual agreements. Certain of our agreements, subject to our standard terms and conditions, have provisions allowing for renegotiation upon mutual agreement.\nWe generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications. Our standard warranty extends for a period of two years from the date of delivery, except in the case of image sensor products, which are warrantied for one year from the date of delivery. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with our customers, they may cancel orders 120 days prior to shipment for standard products without penalty and, for custom products, prior to shipment, provided they pay onsemi's actual costs incurred as of the date we receive the cancellation notice. The loss of one of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment and may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nDistributors\nSales to distributors accounted for approximately 52% of our revenue in 2023, 58% of our revenue in 2022 and 64% of our revenue in 2021. There were no distributors whose revenue exceeded 10% or more of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. We had one distributor whose revenue accounted for approximately 12% and 13% of the total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our distributors resell our products to OEMs, contract\nmanufacturers, and other end-customers. Sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns.\nDirect Customers\nSales to direct customers, accounted for approximately 48% of our revenue in 2023, 42% of our revenue in 2022 and 36% of our revenue in 2021. Large multi-nationals and selected regional OEMs, which are significant in specific markets, form our core direct customers. Generally, these customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our warranty.\nFor additional information regarding agreements with our customers, see \"Markets,\" \"Resources\" and \"Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and Note 2: ''Significant Accounting Policies'' under the heading \"Revenue Recognition\" in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nMarkets\nProduct Development\nonsemi is focused on innovation to create intelligent power and sensing technologies that solve the most challenging customer problems. Our product development efforts are directed towards the following:\n\u2022powering the electrification of the automotive industry with our intelligent power technologies that allow for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles and enable efficient fast-charging systems;\n\u2022propelling the sustainable energy evolution with our intelligent power technologies for the highest efficiency solar strings, industrial power and storage systems;\n\u2022enhancing the automotive mobility experience with our intelligent sensing technologies with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible; and\n\u2022enabling automation and data exchange (Industry 4.0) with our intelligent sensing technologies for smarter factories and buildings.\nWhile our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in areas that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high-growth applications, it is our practice to regularly re-evaluate our research and development spending, to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high-growth technologies. We deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing the return for our research and development investments by targeting innovative products and solutions for high growth applications that we believe position us to outperform the industry.\nEnd-Markets\nWe serve a broad base of end-user markets, with a primary focus towards automotive and industrial.

In addition to these front-end and back-end manufacturing operations, our facility in Hudson, New Hampshire manufactures SiC crystal boules and our facilities in Ro\u017enov pod Radho\u0161t\u011bm, the Czech Republic and Bucheon, South Korea manufactures silicon and SiC wafers that are used by a number of our facilities.\nThe table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or pursuant to joint ventures, the reportable segments that use such facilities, and the approximate gross square footage of each site's building, which includes, among other things, manufacturing, laboratory, warehousing, office, utility, support and unused areas.\n_______________________\n(1)These facilities are leased.\n(2)This facility is used for both front-end and back-end operations.\n(3)These facilities are located on leased land.\nFor additional information regarding acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nAll of our manufacturing facilities are fully owned and operated by us, except our assembly and test operations facility located in Leshan, China, which is owned by Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Limited, a joint venture company in which we own 80% of the outstanding equity interests (\"Leshan\"). The financial and operating results of Leshan have been consolidated in our financial statements. Our joint venture partner is Leshan Radio Company Ltd. (\"Leshan Radio\"), formerly a Chinese state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement between us and Leshan Radio, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment, provided that any shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We purchased 80% of Leshan's production capacity in each of 2023, 2022 and 2021, and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80% of Leshan's expected production capacity in 2024.\nWe use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These manufacturers collectively accounted for approximately 36% of our total manufacturing input costs in 2023, 43% in 2022 and 37% in 2021.\nFor information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations, see \"Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights\nWe market our products under worldwide trademarks, including the ON Semiconductor, ON, onsemi, and various product names and logos, and, in the United States and internationally, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements to protect our IP. We acquired, licensed or sublicensed a significant amount of IP, including patents and patent applications, in connection with our acquisitions, and we have numerous United States and foreign patents issued, allowed and pending. As of December 31, 2023, we held patents with expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2043. We do not consider our business substantially dependent on any single onsemi patent. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate.\nFor information regarding risks associated with intellectual property, see \"Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Intellectual Property\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our business today is driven more by content gains within applications and secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality, as was the case historically. However, we could again experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or macroeconomic conditions.

All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\nThe manufacturing and other operations required to produce our products are highly dependent on the efficient operation of numerous processes, including processes contingent upon third-party component manufacturers and other service providers, and any disruption in these processes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing network includes multiple owned and third-party facilities, which may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product. As a result of this interdependence, an operational disruption at a facility may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products. In the event of a disruption at any such facility, we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties, in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed. Conversely, some of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our end-products, and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product. In the event of any such operational disruption, we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities or transferring production to other existing facilities, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, for certain manufacturing activities and for the supply of raw materials, we utilize third-party suppliers. Our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs, which may be inaccurate, and, in some cases, require longer-term commitments. We are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized third-party suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies. Arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be time-consuming and costly, and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited. Our business operations, productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated, the cost of such services increased significantly, the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect. Generally, our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations, and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources. Shortages could occur in various essential raw materials, and if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner, the costs of our raw materials increase significantly, their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur manufacturing efficiency is contingent upon the operations of these interdependent processes and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this manufacturing efficiency, increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors, or be successful in our manufacturing rationalization plans. For example, public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and related adverse public health developments may cause disruption to our domestic and international operations. Any associated worker absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on certain of our employees\u2019 ability to perform their jobs, office and factory closures or restrictions, labor shortages, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures and/or other travel or health-related restrictions could, depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing activities (or activities of our suppliers, third-party distributors or sub-contractors), could cause disruption and delay to our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments. Such disruption and delays could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities, testing facilities and external manufacturers at expected or minimum purchase obligation levels, or if production capacity increases while revenue does not, the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities and arrangements will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this could strain our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact our working capital. Moreover, if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, we may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If we purchase or commit to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or\nif customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.\nWe may be unable to implement certain business strategies and any issue with the pursuit of such business strategies could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may from time to time determine to implement business strategies and restructuring initiatives in order to remain competitive. Because our strategies and restructuring activities may involve changes to many aspects of our business, including the location of our production facilities and personnel and the potential exit of certain product lines and businesses, our ability to successfully do so depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we are not able to effectively manage or efficiently implement these strategies and/or restructuring initiatives for reasons within or outside of our control, then our business operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, implementation of a business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations. For example, in light of our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, we may take actions to pursue our goal of generating net-zero emissions that may result in material expenditures that could impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or could disrupt our existing operations. Similarly, the contingent risks associated with transferring our existing operations to an acquirer, as is the case with several transition services being provided in connection with some of our prior divestitures, could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or could disrupt our existing operations, especially if the acquirer is unable to meet its commitments under any transition services agreements or if the acquirer encounters financial difficulty. Furthermore, our increased investment in manufacturing capacity (including increased investment in capacity for SiC-based products and technology), while concurrently divesting other non-strategic operations, may adversely impact our existing operations, require additional management time and effort to implement successfully, and lead to higher than anticipated capital expenditures.\nAs we continue to increase production of SiC-based products and ramp manufacturing at EFK and at our facilities in Hudson, New Hampshire, the Czech Republic and South Korea, we may face challenges or risks related to: increased capital spending and long-term capital expenditure commitments, installing and qualifying new manufacturing equipment, meeting planned process yields, maintaining suitable quality control and educating or providing employees with the requisite know-how to operate the processes at our expanded manufacturing facilities. There are inherent execution risks in expanding production capacity, whether at one of our own factories or at a third party that we utilize, all of which could increase our costs and negatively impact our operating results.\nIn addition, to streamline our operations and for efficiency purposes, we are pursuing a number of actions, including the outsourcing of certain internal business processes and the deployment of enhanced end-to-end digital processes (which, in some cases, include the use of AI) for certain business use cases. Such opportunities for improvement and enhanced productivity bring risks associated with managing change, transition costs, and the potential for reduced productivity or user error, in addition to those risks specific to each new process.\nThe failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, even if we fully execute and implement these activities, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business, including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position. To the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other anticipated benefits of strategy or restructuring initiatives, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments or develop new products required to satisfy customer demands, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market enhanced technologies and products. The development of new products is complex and time-consuming, often requiring significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive. In addition, the lengthy development cycle for certain of our products could limit our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and end-users, and we may be unable to develop innovative responses to our customers\u2019 and end-users\u2019 evolving needs on the timelines they require or at all. There can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes, known as \"design wins,\" for new products. In addition, design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments, realize a return on the capital expended or achieve expected gross margins, as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. To the extent that we underinvest in our research\nand development efforts, fail to recognize the need for innovation with respect to our products, or that our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products, we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products attractive to customers, and so our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Further, products that are commercially viable may not have an immediate impact on our revenue or contribute to our operating results in a meaningful way until at least a few years after they are introduced into the market.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, innovation, short product life cycles, evolving regulatory and industry standards and certifications, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions. Products are often replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and, as demand for older technology falls, the price at which such products can be sold drops. If we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins, we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products. In certain limited cases, we may not be able to cease production of older products, either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and, as a result, may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time. If reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for products we sell, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and has experienced significant consolidation, and if we are unable to compete effectively or identify attractive opportunities for consolidation, it could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry depends on elements both within and outside of our control. We face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our competitive position could be weakened relative to our peers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of our products, and our ability to increase our position in our current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. Products or technologies developed by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. We also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are not competitive on the basis of price, quality, technical performance, features, system compatibility, customized design, innovation, availability, delivery timing and reliability. If we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support, our sales and revenue may be materially adversely affected. Competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices, and any inability to maintain revenue or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin. Our gross margins vary due to a variety of factors. Reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. Larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us, and we may be at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to acquire companies to expand our business. Consolidation among competitors and integration among customers could erode our market share, impair our capacity to compete and require us to restructure operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, some of our competitors may receive governmental subsidies or other incentives that give them a competitive advantage over us. For example, the U.S. and the European Union have enacted legislation to provide funding and incentives for semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing in their respective regions. If we are unable to access such funding or incentives, or if our competitors receive more funding or incentives than we do, we may be at a disadvantage in developing and producing new or improved products or technologies, which could adversely affect our market share, revenue and profitability.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive and industrial end-markets, including revenue pursuant to our long-term supply agreements, a downturn or lower sales to customers in either end-market could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industry and the industrial sector. Sales into the automotive and industrial end-markets represented approximately 52% and 28% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The automotive industry is cyclical and the industrial sector tends to thrive during a time of economic\nexpansion, and, as a result, our customers in each end-market are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, inflationary pressure, increases in interest rates, disruptive innovation and end-market preferences, which can adversely affect sales of our products and, correspondingly, our results of operations. Changes in demand in these end-markets can significantly impact our operating results. Additionally, public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to disrupt sales activities to customers in these end-markets, as well as the other end-markets we serve. Lastly, the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in each end-market could decline despite continued growth in such end-markets. Lower sales to customers in either end-market may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFurther, to the extent we have long-term supply agreements with our customers in multiple end-markets which includes fixed pricing, we could be subject to fluctuating manufacturing costs that could negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, under our long-term supply agreements, we could incur certain obligations if we are not able to fulfill our commitments. Furthermore, certain customers, from time to time, have sought and may seek to amend the delivery or other terms of their long-term supply agreements with us. When any such contractual amendments are made, the timing, pricing or amount of products delivered under such long-term supply agreements may be modified in circumstances where we believe it advances the long-term customer relationship or provides us with other benefits. Such an event could have an impact on our results of operations.\nOur operating results depend, in part, on the performance of independent distributors.\nA portion of our sales occurs through global and regional distributors that are not under our control. We rely on distributors to grow and develop their customer base and anticipate customer needs, and any lack of such actions by our distributors may adversely affect our results of operations. These independent distributors also generally represent product lines offered by several companies and are not subject to any minimum sales requirements or obligation to market our products to their customers. In turn, distributors could reduce their sales efforts for our products or choose to terminate their representation of us. In addition, in the event a distributor were to face financial difficulty, experience significant operational disruptions or terminate its operations, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a significant distributor terminates its operations or were to merge with another distributor, we may be more reliant and dependent on the distribution network of our remaining distributors. Additionally, we rely on our distributors to provide accurate and timely sales reports in order for us to be able to generate financial reports that accurately represent distributor sales of our products during any given period. Any inaccuracies or untimely reports could adversely affect our ability to produce accurate and timely financial reports and recognize revenue.\nChanges in, and the regulatory implementation of, tariffs or other government trade policies or political conditions could reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe imposition of tariffs, export controls and other trade restrictions as a result of international trade disputes or changes in trade policies or political conditions may adversely affect our sales and profitability. For example, additional tariffs, other export regulations and the related geopolitical uncertainty between the United States and China and other countries may cause decreased end-market demand for our products from distributors and other customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. More specifically, our assembly and test operations facility located in Leshan, China, which is owned by Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Limited, a joint venture company in which we own 80% of the outstanding equity interests, may be subjected to increased costs or additional trade restrictions stemming from the geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China. Additional tariffs, export controls or other trade restrictions between the two countries could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, tariffs on components that we import from certain nations that have imposed, or may in the future impose, tariffs may adversely affect our profitability unless we are able to exclude such components from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors. To the extent that our sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur international sales and purchases are subject to numerous United States and foreign laws and regulations related to import and export matters. For example, licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries under applicable export control regulations, including the provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. A determination by the United States government or any foreign government that we have failed to comply with trade or export regulations can result in penalties, including fines, administrative, civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities, seizure of products, or, in the extreme case, denial of export privileges or suspension or debarment from government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel, both in the United States. and internationally. In the semiconductor industry, the competition for qualified personnel, particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees is intense. Furthermore, we have operations in many parts of the world that are currently experiencing a tight labor market for skilled employees. Additionally, we have entered into employment agreements with certain senior executives, but we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees. Many of these employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice and would be free to work for a competitor. Specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all and other senior management may be required to divert attention from other aspects of our business. Loss of the services of, or failure to effectively recruit, qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business.\nWarranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls, and the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our contracts, could harm our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nManufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled, clean environment. Minute impurities in our manufacturing materials, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, manufacturing equipment failures, and other defects can cause our products to be non-compliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). In addition, if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in their recall. As suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design, OEMs are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. A successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage, if any, and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Even if our products meet standard specifications, our customers may attempt to use our products in applications for which our products were not designed or in customer products that were not designed or manufactured properly, resulting in product failures and creating customer satisfaction issues, which may harm our reputation.\nSince a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them (and claims for consequential damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenue and profits we receive from the products involved. In certain instances, we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions or other contractual provisions, but there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective. To the extent we are liable for damages in excess of the revenue and profits received from the products involved, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nCurrency fluctuations, changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have sizeable sales and operations in the Asia/Pacific region and Europe, and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than U.S. dollars. In addition, while a significant percentage of our cash is generated outside the United States, many of our liabilities, including our outstanding indebtedness, and certain other cash payments, such as share repurchases, are payable in the United States in U.S. dollars. As a result, currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, repatriation of funds held outside the U.S. could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations. Foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency. As a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the United States, our financial flexibility may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations. Restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the United States may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Intellectual Property\nIf our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the IP rights of others, efforts to address such claims could have\na material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing the IP rights of others. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under such IP rights. However, we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for IP we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies. Further, we may be subject to IP litigation, which could cause us to incur significant expense, materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. In the event of an adverse outcome or pursuant to the terms of a settlement of any such litigation, we may be required to: pay substantial damages or settlement costs; indemnify customers or distributors; cease the manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products; expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies; discontinue the use of certain processes; or obtain licenses, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to continue the use, development and/or sale of the allegedly infringing technologies.\nThe outcome of IP litigation is inherently uncertain and, if not resolved in our favor, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the IP we have developed or licensed, our competitive position, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe enforceability of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, software licenses and other IP is uncertain in certain circumstances. Effective IP protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in the United States and internationally. The various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered IP assets, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts. With respect to our IP generally, we cannot assure you that:\n\u2022any of the substantial number of United States or foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others;\n\u2022any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n\u2022any of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how or mask works that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others;\n\u2022any of our pending or future trademark, copyright, or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; or\n\u2022that we will be able to successfully enforce our IP rights in the United States or foreign countries.\nInfringement or misappropriation of our IP could result in lost market and revenue opportunities, and if we are unable to enforce and protect our IP it could have an adverse impact on our competitive position and business. Further, our assertion of IP rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged IP rights of its own against us, which may materially and adversely impact our business. An unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products, which could in turn negatively affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies, including technologies that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors\u2019 rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to IP arising out of our research. Should we be unable to protect our IP, competitors may develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies, benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Technology and Data Privacy\nDisruptions or breaches of our information technology systems could irreparably damage our reputation and our business, expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe routinely collect and store sensitive data, including confidential and other proprietary information about our business and our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations and business strategy. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions, failures or breaches of our information technology environment, such as those caused by computer viruses, illegal\nhacking, criminal fraud or impersonation, acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error. Our cyber-security measures and/or those of our third-party service providers and/or customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches. Although we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents impacting us directly that have been material to us as of the year ended December 31, 2023, we continue to devote resources to reduce the risk of or alleviate cyber-security breaches and vulnerabilities and those costs could be significant. Our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales, manufacturing operations, distribution or other critical functions. Any compromise of our information security could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business, an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets, the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws. In addition, computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, and any such attack, if successful, could expose us to liability to customer claims. Further, AI capabilities may be used to identify vulnerabilities and craft increasingly sophisticated cyber-security attacks. Any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We maintain cyber risk insurance, although an insufficiency of insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flows and overall profitability. Furthermore, our efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations related to cybersecurity, such as the recently enacted SEC rules requiring disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident, may be costly and any failure to comply could result in investigations, proceedings, investor lawsuits and reputational damage.\nWe are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection.\nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect Personally Identifiable Information (\"PII\") and other data as part of our business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the United States. Additionally, within the United States, different states have enacted various regulations governing the treatment of PII. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to Company officials or us, including substantial monetary fines, and could damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Regulation\nEnvironmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe semiconductor industry continues to be subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. We also have operations subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other requirements, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. We have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites, and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances. However, we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs. In addition, the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including:\n\u2022changes in United States and international environmental or health and safety laws or regulations, including, but not limited to, future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns;\n\u2022the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted;\n\u2022our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities;\n\u2022the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims, including the cost of clean-up of currently unknown environmental conditions; or\n\u2022the cost of fines, penalties or other legal liability, should we fail to comply with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations.\nFailure to comply with these laws or regulations could subject us to significant costs and liabilities. To the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance, we may bear the full effect of such costs, expenses and liabilities, which could materially adversely\naffect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could result in penalties that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits, along with various other anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by the U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are, therefore, subject to complex income tax and transfer pricing regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Changes to, or interpretations of, tax legislation or regulations could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities. In addition, other factors or events, such as changes to our operating structure, strategy and investment decisions, could also increase our future effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities.\nTax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income (\u201cFDII\u201d). Beginning in 2026, the effective rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16%. Further, if U.S. rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely (potentially materially) affected. Also, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United States, our FDII deduction may be reduced.\nFurther changes in tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). For example, the OECD continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards.\nThese changes, if adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the impact of any new tax legislation may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made and future regulatory guidance.\nSocial and environmental responsibility regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors.\nWith the increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry, a number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. In addition, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products. As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers\u2019 demands, which may harm our sales and operating results.\nMany investors also expect companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies, practices and metrics under voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks. We periodically communicate our strategies, goals and targets related to our corporate social and environmental policies and programs. These strategies, goals and targets, and their underlying assumptions and projections, reflect our current plans and aspirations, but we may be unable to achieve them. It is also possible that our investors might not be satisfied with our policies, programs, goals, performance and related disclosures, or the speed of their adoption, implementation and measurable success, or that we have adopted such policies, programs and commitments at all.\nIn addition, unfavorable ratings or assessment of our corporate social and environmental policies and programs, including our compliance with certain voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital.\nFurthermore, in light of our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, future customer or investor expectations and regulatory requirements, we may take actions to pursue our goal of generating net-zero emissions or to alter our processes that may result in material expenditures that could impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or could disrupt our existing operations.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $3,379.9 million of outstanding principal relating to our indebtedness. We may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt, to make acquisitions or for other purposes, and if we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $1.1 billion available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors, including impacting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate purposes.\nTo the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe inability to meet our obligations under our New Credit Agreement could materially and adversely affect us by, among other things, limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nThe obligations under the New Credit Agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property of our domestic subsidiaries. As a result, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the New Credit Agreement, the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness, in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, the New Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayment if the outstanding amounts drawn thereunder exceed the total commitments, which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility rather than using funds for other business purposes. Our financing structure, and any inability to meet our obligations thereunder, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including, among other things, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nThe agreements relating to our indebtedness, including the New Credit Agreement and the 3.875% Notes, may restrict our ability to operate our business, and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur debt agreements, including the New Credit Agreement and the 3.875% Notes, contain, and any future debt agreements may include, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to: incur additional debt; incur liens; make certain investments or acquisitions; redeem, or otherwise perform our obligations under the terms of, our 3.875% Notes; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other \"change of control\" transactions; make distributions to our stockholders; engage in restructuring activities; engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions; and issue or repurchase stock or other securities.\nSuch agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements, including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests. Our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them. To the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, and any inability to repay our debt when required would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make required payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive, and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling additional assets, reducing or delaying capital investments, or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect.\nFurthermore, we cannot assure you that, if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event, our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness, which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. A default under our committed credit facilities, including our New Credit Agreement, could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations, we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock, which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders.\nAn event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf there were an event of default under certain of our agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately, which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness. Any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default and, as described above, any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our operating subsidiaries, which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt, are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal, contractual, governmental, or regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and, as described above, any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf interest rates continue to increase, our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBorrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time, including under our New Credit Agreement, are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates continue to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. To the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated, the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, significant changes in our credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets, including bank failures, or incurrence of new or refinancing of existing indebtedness at higher interest rates could have a material and adverse effect on our access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition.\nThe timing of the cash payments to service the 0% Notes, the 0.50% Notes and the 3.875% Notes is not entirely in our control and may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy these obligations in a timely manner.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding approximately $804.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 0% Notes, $1,500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% Notes and $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% Notes (collectively, the \"Outstanding Notes\"). Holders of the Outstanding Notes have certain rights that would require us to make repurchases prior to the stated maturity for all or a portion of the amounts due in certain circumstances. For example, holders of the 3.875% Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all of their 3.875% Notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events accompanied by certain ratings events (as described in the indenture governing the 3.875% Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, accrued prior to, but not including, the repurchase date.\nServicing the Outstanding Notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under such notes. Our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 0% Notes or the 0.50% Notes, repurchase any of the Outstanding Notes in the case of an applicable repurchase-triggering event under the respective indentures or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control.\nIn certain circumstances, a takeover of our Company and similar triggering events could also trigger an option of the holders of the 0% Notes, the 0.50% Notes and the 3.875% Notes to require us to repurchase such notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our Company that would otherwise be beneficial to the holders of the 0% Notes, the 0.50% Notes, the 3.875% Notes and our common stock, which could materially decrease the value of such notes and of our common stock.\nThe terms of the New Credit Agreement and the terms of the 3.875% Notes limit the amount of future indebtedness secured by liens that we may incur. If we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above. Our decision to use our cash for other purposes, such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock, could also intensify these risks.\nNote hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nConcurrently with the issuances of the 1.625% Notes, the 0% Notes and the 0.50% Notes, respectively, we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions, which we refer to as the option counterparties. The convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the respective series of notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes of such series, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties with respect to the 1.625% Notes, the 0% Notes and the 0.50% Notes. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds $30.70, with respect to the 1.625% Notes, $74.34, with respect to the 0% Notes and $156.78 with respect to the 0.50% Notes.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions for the 1.625% Notes, the 0% Notes and the 0.50% Notes, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of such notes. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nCounterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions, if realized, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions.\nTo the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions, we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 1.625% Notes, the 0% Notes and/or the 0.50% Notes and/or cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of\nconverted 1.625% Notes, the 0% Notes and/or the 0.50% Notes, as the case may be. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the option counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock. Any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our Company, which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions:\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, which is preferred stock that our Board of Directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval and that could be issued with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt; and\n\u2022require the approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding common stock to amend certain of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or by-laws.\nAlthough we believe these provisions make a higher third-party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. Any delay or prevention of an acquisition of our Company that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock.\nThe amount and frequency of our share repurchases are affected by a number of factors and may fluctuate.\nAlthough we have adopted a share repurchase program, we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares under our share repurchase program or at all. The amount, timing, and purchases under our share repurchase program, if any, are influenced by many factors and may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash and because of changes in tax laws, and the market price of our common stock. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions (including the acquisition of EFK and the acquisition of GTAT, a producer of SiC-based products and technology) and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Successful acquisitions and alliances in our industry require, among other things, efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts, often in markets or regions in which we have less experience. Risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include, but are not limited to: (1) the ability to integrate information technology and other systems; (2) issues not discovered in our due diligence; (3) customers responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company; (4) diversion of management\u2019s attention from our day to day operations; and (5) loss of key employees post-integration. In addition, we may incur unexpected costs or taxes resulting from the acquisition or integration of the newly acquired business. Missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions, which could be caused by factors outside of our control, or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDepending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business, we may be required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and SEC rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements. The acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems, any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis. Any revisions to, inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a\nmaterial adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDownturns or volatility in general economic conditions, as well as general macroeconomic trends and impacts, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nHistorically, worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impacts of adverse economic conditions, specifically financial crises, subsequent recoveries and persistent economic uncertainty. Recent global economic slowdowns could continue and potentially result in certain economies dipping into economic recessions, including in the United States. In addition, we are aware of and are monitoring the economic environment and related forecasts, which suggest (in certain parts of the world) an economic slowdown.\nWe have in the past and could in the future experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions; the onset of an economic recession and volatile or uncertain economic conditions can adversely impact our sales and profitability and make it difficult for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Furthermore, inflationary pressure and increases in interest rates have and may continue to increase our costs, which could negatively impact revenue, earnings and demand for our products.\nIn addition to general economic conditions, impacts of other macroeconomic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and risks, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, climate change and other natural disasters, banking failures and uncertainties in global financial markets, could materially adversely impact our operations by causing disruptions in the geographies in which we and our suppliers, third party distributors and sub-contractors operate. If any of these events impact our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments could be delayed, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and customer service interruption. Such events can negatively impact revenue and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow.\nRegulatory and legislative developments related to climate change may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nVarious jurisdictions have developed or are developing climate change-based laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as heightened investor expectations, on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure, are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply, with such policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers and investors, a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares, or parties may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. Any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or others in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.",

    "item_1C": "Item 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nThe secure processing, maintenance and transmission of sensitive data, including confidential and other proprietary information about our business and our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners, is important to our operations and business strategy. As a result, cybersecurity and data protection are key components of our long-term strategy.\nWe use various processes to inform our assessment, identification and management of risk from cybersecurity threats. Key areas of our cybersecurity risk management processes and strategy currently include:\n\u2022Cross-Functional Collaboration and Coordination. Our Enterprise Cybersecurity Services (\u201cECS\u201d) team, led by our Chief Information Security Officer (\u201cCISO\u201d), has first line responsibility for our cybersecurity risk management processes. However, the ECS team works in partnership with other internal teams to coordinate efforts, priorities and oversight. These include:\n\u25e6our Cybersecurity Executive Council (the \u201cCouncil\u201d), which is composed of key leaders from stakeholder groups throughout the Company, including the CISO and certain members of senior management;\n\u25e6our Enterprise Risk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) team, which is responsible for evaluating and assessing overall enterprise risk, including cybersecurity risk, and advising senior management and the Board regarding our overall risk profile and priorities as they evolve;\n\u25e6our Internal Audit Department (\u201cIAD\u201d), which monitors certain IT systems controls that are integrated into our larger Sarbanes-Oxley control environment; and\n\u25e6our Cyber Incident Response Team (\u201cCIRT\u201d), a cross-functional team of subject matter experts from across the Company and certain third-party support providers that we have on retainer.\n\u2022Ongoing Evaluation and Assessment of Systems and Processes. We update our information security management system from time to time as appropriate and we employ standards and frameworks as we deem necessary to assist us in monitoring compliance with regulatory, industry and evolving data privacy requirements. In addition to periodic in-depth evaluations of our systems and processes, we monitor our IT systems and processes on an ongoing basis with the goal of identifying and remediating real and potential threats as they arise. We adjust our systems, procedures and policies regularly as we deem necessary in response to identified threats and risks.\n\u2022Security Awareness Program to Train and Test Personnel. We sponsor a multi-faceted security awareness program that includes regular, mandatory trainings for our personnel on data protection and malware detection, policy and process awareness, periodic phishing simulations and other kinds of preparedness testing.\n\u2022Cyber Incident Response Plan. We maintain a cross-functional cyber incident response plan with defined roles, responsibilities and reporting protocols. This plan, which we evaluate and test on a regular basis, focuses on responding to and recovering from any significant breach as well as mitigating any impact to our business. Generally, when a breach or suspected breach is identified, the ECS team would escalate the issue to the Council for initial analysis and guidance. In the event of a significant breach, the CIRT, overseen by the Council, would typically be tasked with preparing an initial response. The Council (in consultation with, among others, the CIRT) would be responsible for determining whether a particular incident (alone or in combination with other factors) triggers any reporting or notification responsibilities.\n\u2022Regular Evaluation of Initiatives, Results and Priorities. The ECS team, in consultation with the Council and other members of senior management, updates its strategy at least annually to account for changes in our business strategy, legal and regulatory developments across our geographic footprint, the results of our recent ECS initiatives, and further developments in the cybersecurity threat landscape. In addition, we periodically engage a third-party provider to conduct an external assessment of our security program. The results of this assessment, which are reported to the Audit Committee (and the Board, as appropriate), assist us in determining whether any further changes to our existing policies and practices are warranted.\nWe expect that our cybersecurity risk management processes and strategy will continue to evolve as the cybersecurity threat landscape evolves.\nAs indicated above, we engage third-party providers to assist us with our cybersecurity risk management and strategy. Some of these providers provide us with ongoing assistance (such as threat monitoring, mitigation strategies, updates on emerging trends and developments and policy guidance) while we engage others to provide targeted assistance (such as security and forensic expertise) as needed. Prior to exchanging any sensitive data or integrating with any key third-party provider, we assess their security fitness against our risk posture and request changes as we deem necessary.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats (including any previous cybersecurity incidents) that have materially affected the Company, our business strategy, our results of operations or our financial condition. For a discussion of risks from cybersecurity threats that could be reasonably likely to materially affect us, please see our Risk Factors discussion under the heading, \u201cTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Technology and Data Privacy\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nConsistent with our overall risk management governance structure, management is responsible for the day-to-day management of cybersecurity risk while our Board and its Audit Committee play an active, ongoing oversight role.\nBoard Oversight. Our Board has delegated to its Audit Committee specific, first-line responsibility for overseeing major cybersecurity risk exposures in addition to our broader ERM program. Specifically, under its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity posture, risk assessment, strategy and mitigation and for making recommendations to address and resolve any breaches or issues related to the protection or privacy of our data. Management (including our Chief Information Officer (\u201cCIO\u201d) and our CISO) reports at least quarterly to the Audit Committee on information security and data privacy and protection. These presentations address a wide range of topics, including trends in cyber threats and the status of initiatives intended to bolster our security systems and the cyber readiness of our personnel. The Audit Committee chair reports to the full Board on these risk discussions as appropriate. At least annually, the Board meets with members of our ERM team to review and discuss our ERM program, including areas of material risk and how these risks, which may include cybersecurity risk, are being managed and reported to the Board and its committees.\nManagement\u2019s Role. Our ECS team is composed of several support teams that address and respond to cyber risk, including cyber risks related to security architecture and engineering, identity and access management and security operations. Formerly known as our Information Security and Risk (\u201cISR\u201d) team, the ECS team oversees compliance with our cybersecurity framework within the organization and facilitates cybersecurity risk management activities throughout the organization. The ECS team also assists with the review and approval of policies, completes benchmarking against applicable standards, maintains a cyber risk registrar and oversees the security awareness program.\nOur ECS team is led by our CISO. Our CISO reports to our CIO who, in turn, reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our CISO has 24 years of experience in leading global security functions and strategies. Collectively, the other members of our ECS team have decades of relevant education and experience and maintain a wide range of industry certifications. We invest in regular, ongoing cybersecurity training for our ECS team.\nAs noted previously, our CISO is a member of the Council, which meets at least quarterly to provide operational direction to the ECS team considering the evolving risk landscape. The ECS team and the Council, through ongoing communication, monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents. The CISO, in consultation with the Council and other members of senior management, reports such threats and incidents to the Audit Committee, as appropriate. These reports may be included in, or in addition to, his regular quarterly reports to the Audit Committee.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors and speak only as of the filing date. Actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nExecutive Overview\nThis executive overview presents summarized information regarding our business and operating trends only. For further information relating to the information summarized herein, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in its entirety.\nonsemi Results\nOur revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $8,253.0 million, representing a nominal decrease of 0.9% from $8,326.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. During 2023, we reported net income attributable to onsemi of $2,183.7 million compared to $1,902.2 million in 2022. Our operating income totaled $2,538.7 million during 2023 compared to $2,360.0 million during 2022. The increases in our operating income and net income were primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges related to our QCS wind down in 2022 amounting to $386.8 million, which did not reoccur in 2023. Our gross margin decreased by approximately 190 basis points to 47.1% in 2023 from 49.0% in 2022. See discussion under \"Results of Operations\" for the reasons for the fluctuations year over year.\nBusiness and Macroeconomic Environment\nThe semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical, has often experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions, and may experience uncertainty and volatility in the future.\nDuring 2023, the semiconductor industry experienced a slow down due to softening demand. We are monitoring the economic environment and related forecasts, and for indicators that would suggest the global economic slowdown could continue. Given the current conditions, we are actively managing and have taken corrective actions in our manufacturing capacity and spending to align with the forecasted 2024 demand. We believe the current volatility in general economic conditions is not expected to have a significant impact on our long-term strategic and growth initiatives.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate cost-saving initiatives to be able to align our overall cost structure, capital investments and other expenditures with our expected revenue, spending and capacity levels to help offset increased manufacturing and operating costs. We have taken, and continue to take actions, including but not limited to, exiting product lines that do not support our gross margin improvements and strategic objectives and aligning internal manufacturing capacity and resources to external demand.\nSee Note 7: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, net'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information relating to our most recent cost-saving initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 is included below. For a discussion and comparison of the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021, refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\" in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on February 6, 2023.\nOperating Results\nThe following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements (in millions):\nRevenue\nRevenue was $8,253.0 million and $8,326.2 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease from 2022 to 2023 of $73.2 million, or 0.9%, was attributable to a 12.4% decrease in revenue in ASG, partially offset by a 5.7% and 3.0% increase in revenue in PSG and ISG, respectively, which are further explained below. There were no customers whose revenue exceeded 10% or more of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRevenue by operating and reportable segments was as follows (dollars in millions):\n_______________________\n(1)Certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.\nRevenue from PSG\nRevenue from PSG increased by $240.8 million, or approximately 5.7%, during 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue from our Advanced Power Division increased by $527.9 million, offset by a decrease of $287.1 million in our Integrated Circuits, Protection and Signal Division. This increase was primarily driven by our continued ramp up in SiC and other power automotive solutions, while the decrease was primarily driven by planned customer product exits and reduced demand driven by lower end-market requirements for these products.\nRevenue from ASG\nRevenue from ASG decreased by $352.8 million, or approximately 12.4%, during 2023 compared to 2022, due to a decrease in revenue from our Power Management Division of $354.7 million, primarily driven by the planned end of life for targeted products as well as a general decline in demand in the computing and consumer end-markets.\nRevenue from ISG\nRevenue from ISG increased by $38.8 million, or approximately 3.0%, during 2023 compared to 2022, which was largely driven by an increase in revenue from our Automotive Sensing Division of $117.4 million primarily due to the reallocation of internal capacity to products yielding higher average selling prices. This was partially offset by a decrease of $78.7 million in our Industrial and Consumer Solutions Division due to capacity reallocation and planned product exits.\nRevenue by Geographic Location\nRevenue by geographic location, based on sales billed from the respective country or regions, are as follows (dollars in millions):\n_______________________\n(1)Certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit was $3,883.5 million and $4,077.2 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing a decrease of $193.7 million or approximately 5%.\nFor the overall Company, the decline in existing product revenue negatively impacted gross profit by approximately $400 million, and higher manufacturing costs at our EFK location, which include start up and ramp up costs, along with an unfavorable impact from our foundry business, negatively impacted gross profit by approximately $160 million. This decrease was partially offset by the gross profit of approximately $320 million from new product sales.\nOur gross margin decreased by 1.9% from 49.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 47.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to the impact of the factors explained above.\nOur gross profit and gross margin percentages by operating and reportable segment were as follows (dollars in millions):\n_______________________\n(1)Certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.\nExplanation for the increase or decrease in gross profit amounts and gross margin percentages for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 is provided below:\nPSG gross profit and gross margin increased by $117 million and 0.1%, respectively, primarily driven by increased revenue from new product sales, which contributed approximately $320 million, and was partially offset by the impact of the decrease in revenue from existing products amounting to approximately $180 million.\nASG gross profit and gross margin decreased by $342.6 million and 6.4%, respectively, primarily driven by the decline in existing product revenue which impacted gross profit by approximately $250 million, as well as the higher manufacturing costs at our EFK location, which includes the unfavorable impact of our foundry business of approximately $120 million.\nISG gross profit and gross margin increased by $31.9 million and 1%, respectively, primarily driven by increased revenue in existing products due to favorable pricing and product mix.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were $577.3 million and $600.2 million, or approximately 7% and 7% of revenue for 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing a decrease of $22.9 million, or approximately 4% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in new product development costs.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses were $279.1 million and $287.9 million, or approximately 3% and 3% of revenue for 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing a decrease of $8.8 million, or approximately 3% year-over-year, primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $362.4 million and $343.2 million, or approximately 4% and 4% of revenue for 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing an increase of $19.2 million, or approximately 6% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with information technology initiatives and a bad debt provision on outstanding receivable balances generated under an agreement with a business partner, which was partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $51.1 million and $81.2 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing a decrease of $30.1 million, or approximately 37.1%, year-over-year. The decrease was due to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the QCS wind down during 2022, and a reduction in amortization expense as certain intangible assets became fully amortized.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, net\nRestructuring, asset impairments and other charges, net was $74.9 million and $17.9 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively,\nrepresenting an increase of $57.0 million. Charges in 2023 related primarily to the business realignment efforts during 2023. For additional information, see Note 7: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, net'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were zero and $386.8 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2022, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $330.0 million and intangible asset impairment charges of $56.8 million related to the QCS wind down. See Note 6: ''Goodwill and Intangible Assets'' in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\nOther Income and Expenses\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by $20.1 million, or approximately 21.2%, to $74.8 million during 2023 compared to $94.9 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the balance under the Term Loan \"B\" Facility, which was repaid with proceeds from the 0.50% Notes. Additionally, the 1.625% Notes matured and were repaid during October 2023. Our average gross amount of long-term debt balance (including current maturities) during 2023 and 2022 was $3,304.1 million and $3,243.3 million, respectively. Our weighted average interest rate on our gross amount of long-term debt (including current maturities) was 2.3% and 2.9% per annum in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInterest income\nInterest income increased by $77.6 million, or approximately 500.6%, to $93.1 million during 2023 compared to $15.5 million in 2022, primarily due to the increase in interest rates during 2023 along with a strategic shift in our investment strategy.\nSee \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Key Financing and Capital Events\" below and Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of our indebtedness and our refinancing activities.\nGain (loss) on divestiture of businesses\nLoss on divestiture of business was $0.7 million in 2023, compared to a gain of $67.0 million in 2022. During 2022, we divested the wafer manufacturing facilities in Niigata, Japan, Pocatello, Idaho, South Portland, Maine and Oudenaarde, Belgium and recognized the gain relating to such divestitures.\nLoss on Debt Refinancing and Prepayment\nWe recorded loss on debt refinancing and prepayment of $13.3 million during 2023 compared to $7.1 million during 2022. The 2023 loss was due to the write-off relating to the repayment of the Term Loan \"B\" Facility, and the 2022 loss was primarily related to the partial prepayment of the Term \"B\" Facility. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Key Financing and Capital Events\" below and Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of our indebtedness and our refinancing activities.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net was an expense of $7.2 million in 2023, compared to an income of $21.7 million in 2022. During 2023 we recognized actuarial losses on pension plans of $4.0 million, whereas we recognized actuarial gains on pension plans of $22.1 million during 2022.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $350.2 million and $458.4 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 13.8% and 19.4%. The decrease in our effective tax rate was due to the goodwill impairments in the prior year, which were not deductible for tax purposes, and a current year benefit due to the net release of unrecognized tax benefits.\nFor additional information, see Note 16: ''Income Taxes'' and Note 6: ''Goodwill and Intangible Assets'' in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility as well as new debt and/or equity issuances. In the near term, we expect to fund our cash requirements by utilizing any or a combination of these principal sources, including any amounts required to satisfy our current portion of long-term debt. Our cash and cash equivalents were $2,483.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and our Revolving Credit Facility has approximately $1.1 billion available for future borrowings as of December 31, 2023.\nWe require cash to: (i) fund our operating expenses, working capital requirements, outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments; (ii) service our debt, including principal and interest; (iii) incur capital expenditures; and (iv) repurchase our common stock.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand. Our capital expenditures are primarily directed towards manufacturing equipment and can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted.\nWe believe that the key factors that could adversely affect our internal and external sources of cash include:\n\u2022changes in demand for our products, competitive pricing pressures, supply chain constraints, effective management of our manufacturing capacity, our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses, our ability to make progress on the achievement of our business strategy and sustainability goals, the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business; and\n\u2022the debt and equity capital markets could impact our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following are the significant sources and uses of cash during 2023:\n\u2022Cash flows from operating activities of $1,977.5 million.\n\u2022Purchase of property, plant & equipment of $1,575.6 million.\n\u2022Issuance of $1.5 billion of 0.50% Notes, the net proceeds of which were used to repay the existing indebtedness under the Term Loan \"B\" Facility, net cost of the related convertible note hedges, the related transaction fees and general corporate purposes.\n\u2022Repayment of $125 million under the Revolver due 2024 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\u2022Entering into the New Credit Agreement consisting of a $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility and draw down of $375 million to repay the entire outstanding balance under the Revolver due 2024 in the second quarter of 2023.\n\u2022Repurchases of approximately 7.6 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $564.0 million under the Share Repurchase Program.\n\u2022Repayment of the 1.625% Notes amounting to $119.6 million in cash upon maturity and issuance of approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock to settle the excess over the principal.\nOperating Activities\nOur long-term cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash. Our cash flows from operating activities were $1,977.5 million, $2,633.1 million and $1,782.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Our operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $655.6 million, or 24.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 and was primarily attributable to increased working capital requirements related to our strategic investments in SiC inventory and our strategic investments in inventory for fab transitions, and payments related to the 2022 variable compensation.\nOur ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on, among other factors, our success in achieving our revenue goals and in meeting LTSA commitments and manufacturing and operating cost targets. Management of our assets and liabilities, including both working capital and long-term assets and liabilities, also influences our operating cash flows.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows used in investing activities were $1,737.9 million, $705.4 million and $915.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $1,032.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures, the absence of any divestiture activities in 2023 and the remaining payment of $236.3 million related to the acquisition of our EFK location. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we paid $1,575.6 million, $1,005.0 million and $444.6 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures as a percent of revenue increased in 2023 to 19%, primarily as a result of investments to expand SiC manufacturing capacity. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 10% - 12% of revenue as these investments along with other capital initiatives are expected to decrease.\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows used in financing activities were $686.5 million, $370.0 million and $569.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $316.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to proceeds and payments related to long-term borrowings and share repurchase activity. During 2023, we replaced the Revolver due 2024 maturing on June 28, 2024 with the Revolving Credit Facility. We do not have any meaningful debt maturing during the next 12 months. Our 0% Notes are classified as a current liability based on share price trigger provisions. We expect to continue repurchases under our Share Repurchase Program subject to market conditions, the price of our shares and other factors (including liquidity needs). However, the Share Repurchase Program may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nSee Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information related to liquidity matters.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 0% Notes, 0.50% Notes and 3.875% Notes and with the financial covenants included in the New Credit Agreement. The 0% Notes, 0.50% Notes and 3.875% Notes are senior to the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of onsemi and its guarantor subsidiaries, rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt and, as unsecured obligations, are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt. Failure to comply with any of our covenants or any other terms of our New Credit Agreement could result in higher interest rates in our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt. In order to remain in compliance with the various financial covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital, our capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to, among other things, our future operating performance, as well as financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $804.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 0% Notes, $1,500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 0.50% Notes and $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Notes. The aggregate principal amount of outstanding 0% Notes, net of unamortized discount and issuance costs, has been reclassified as a current portion of long-term debt based on the share price trigger provisions. The associated interest expense related to our indebtedness will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nSee Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' and Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\nKey Financing and Capital Events\nOverview\nWe continually evaluate our debt and capital structure and when appropriate, we have completed various measures to secure liquidity, repurchase shares of our common stock, reduce interest costs, amend or replace existing key financing arrangements and, in some cases, extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility. We took certain of these actions in 2023, which included the issuance of $1.5 billion of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes to repay our Term Loan \"B\" facility and the termination and replacement of the Prior Credit Agreement with the New Credit Agreement. See Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' and for further discussion on the Share Repurchase Program, see Note 10: ''Earnings Per Share and Equity'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n2023 Financing Events\n\u2022Issuance of $1.5 billion of 0.50% Notes on February 28, 2023, the net proceeds of which were used to repay $1,086.0 million of the existing indebtedness under the Term Loan \"B\" Facility, the related transaction fees and expenses and to pay approximately $171.5 million net cost of the related convertible note hedges.\n\u2022Repayment of $125 million under the Revolver due 2024 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\u2022Entering into the New Credit Agreement consisting of a $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility and draw down of $375 million to repay the entire outstanding balance under the Revolver due 2024 in the second quarter of 2023.\n\u2022Repurchases of approximately 7.6 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $564.0 million under the Share Repurchase Program.\n\u2022Repayment of the 1.625% Notes amounting to $119.6 million in cash upon maturity and issuance of approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock to settle the excess over the principal.\n2022 Financing Events\n\u2022Draw down of $500.0 million on the Revolver due 2024 and partial repayment of the outstanding balance on the Term Loan \"B\" facility and corresponding write off of $7.3 million of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs.\n\u2022Repurchases of approximately 4.0 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $259.8 million under the previous share repurchase program.\n\u2022Settlement with certain holders of the 1.625% Notes to repurchase or exchange, as applicable, $16.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% Notes for a total consideration of $16.0 million in cash and 552,000 shares of common stock.\n\u2022Entry into the Tenth Amendment to the Prior Credit Agreement to transition the interest rate base from the LIBO Rate to Term SOFR.\n2021 Financing Events\n\u2022Issuance of $805.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% Notes, after paying $160.3 million in cash for the convertible note hedges and receipt of $93.8 million in cash for the sale of warrants.\n\u2022Settlement with certain holders of the 1.625% Notes to repurchase or exchange, as applicable, $372.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% Notes for a total consideration of $506.5 million in cash and 5.4 million shares of common stock.

We believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. We utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements. In addition to our critical accounting policies below, see Note 2: ''Significant Accounting Policies'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience, current and expected future conditions, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i) calculation of future payouts for customer incentives and amounts subject to allowances and returns; (ii) valuation and obsolescence relating to inventories; (iii) measurement of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, and evaluations of uncertain tax positions; (iv) assumptions used in business combinations; and (v) testing for impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. We generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to direct customers and distributors. We also generate revenue, to a much lesser extent, from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers. We apply a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (i) identifying the contract with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative stand-alone selling price. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled.\nWe recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer. For sales agreements, we have identified the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the performance obligation. For product development agreements, we have identified the completion of a service defined in the agreement to be the performance obligation. We recognize revenue from manufacturing services when we satisfy the performance obligation by transferring the promised goods or services to the customer. Depending on the terms of the applicable contractual agreement with the customer, revenue is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or service, or over time when the created asset has no alternate use to us and there is an enforceable right to payment for the performance to date.\nSales to certain distributors, primarily those with ship and credit rights, can be subject to price adjustment on certain products. We develop an estimate of their expected claims under the ship and credit program based on the historical claims data submitted by product and customer and expected future claims, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the amount of each claim as well as the historical period used to develop the estimate.\nOur direct customers do not have the right to return products, other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty. Sales to distributors, however, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, ship and credit claims and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue are recognized, and are netted against revenue. For non-quality related returns, we recognize a related asset for the right to recover returned products with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold. We record a reserve for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenue, based on the experience with each customer.\nInventories. We carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end-user demand. The determination of projected end-user demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected unit sales for each product. These provisions can influence our results from operations. For example, when demand falls for a given part, all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved, impacting our cost of revenue and gross profit. The majority of\nproduct inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded. However, we do sell some products that have previously been written down, such sales have historically been consistently insignificant and the related impact on our margins has also been insignificant.\nIncome Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized.\nIn determining the amount of the valuation allowance, estimated future taxable income, feasible tax planning strategies, future reversals of existing temporary differences and taxable income in prior carryback years, if a carryback is permitted are considered. If we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized, the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense.\nWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. No tax benefit is recognized for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained. Our practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made, which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate.\nBusiness Combination. We use estimates and assumptions in allocating the purchase price of acquired business by utilizing established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry to record the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. We utilize the income approach, cost approach or market approach, depending upon which approach is the most appropriate based on the nature and reliability of available data. If the income approach is used, the fair value determination is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that an asset is expected to generate over its economic life and involves significant assumptions as to cash flows, associated expenses, long-term growth rates and discount rates. The cost approach takes into account the cost to replace (or reproduce) the asset and involves assumptions relating to the asset's value of physical, functional and/or economic obsolescence that has occurred with respect to the asset. The market approach is used to estimate value from an analysis of actual transactions or offerings for economically comparable assets available as of the valuation date. Determining the fair value of acquired technology assets is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate, revenue growth rates, projected gross margins, and estimated research and development expenses.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Our impairment evaluation consists of a qualitative assessment, and if deemed necessary, a quantitative test is performed which compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nDetermining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected net cash flows, discount and long-term growth rates. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows. The assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and industry trends. We consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and long-term growth rates to use in its analysis. We consider other valuation methods, such as the cost approach or market approach, if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable.\nImpairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses, if applicable, are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results. We continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group. The dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests. As we continue to implement our business strategy to rationalize products and manufacturing locations to transition to a lighter internal fabrication model, there could be divestiture transactions resulting in a portion of goodwill or other assets being de-recognized, and which may or may not result in accounting charges.\nContingencies. We are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. Based on the available information, we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 4: ''Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Other Developments'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our gross long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled $3,379.9 million. We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $3,004.9 million. We do have interest rate exposure with respect to our Revolving Credit Facility, which had a $375.0 million balance as of December 31, 2023. We estimate a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $1.9 million. However, this impact may be partially offset by the additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nTo ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions, we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions. However, given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged, we cannot provide any assurances that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.\nWe are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the U.S. Dollar as a normal part of the reporting process. Some of our Japanese operations utilize Japanese Yen as the functional currency, which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nWe enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $262.2 million and $272.0 million, respectively.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. Dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies, including Chinese Renminbi, Czech Koruna, Euros, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Malaysian Ringgit, Philippine Peso and Vietnamese Dong. Due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies, our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the U.S. Dollar. For example, we determined that based on a hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates, our operating income would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately $125.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, assuming no offsetting hedge position or correlated activities.\nSee Note 15: ''Financial Instruments'' in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further information with respect to our hedging activity.",

In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\" of this Form 10-K.",
