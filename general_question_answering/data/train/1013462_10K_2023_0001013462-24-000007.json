It also enables us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global network, provides relative stability to our operations to help mitigate geography-specific economic trends and provides us with an opportunity to take advantage of new geographic markets or enhance our sales coverage in existing markets.\nThe channel partners, under the direction of our sales management team, market and sell our products to new customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer training and consulting services and often provide the first line of our technical support. Our channel partner certification process helps to confirm that each channel partner has the ongoing capability to adequately represent our expanding product lines and to provide an appropriate level of training, consultation and customer support. We derived 26.1%, 23.9% and 23.7% of our total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 5% of our revenue in 2023, 2022 or 2021. Information with respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the section entitled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSTRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS\nAnsys has and continues to be committed to operating as an open platform, enabling our customers to easily integrate simulation into their R&D workflows. To further that vision, we have established and continue to pursue strategic alliances with advanced technology suppliers, cloud computing providers, hardware vendors, software vendors, specialized application developers and CAD, EDA and PLM providers. We believe that these relationships facilitate accelerated incorporation of advanced technology into our products, provide access to new customers, expand our sales channels, develop specialized product applications and provide direct integration with leading CAD, EDA, product data management and PLM systems.\nWe have technical relationships with leading CAD vendors, such as Autodesk, PTC and Siemens Digital Industries, to provide direct links between products. These links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the CAD systems and our products.\nWe work with leading EDA software companies, including Altium, Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Siemens EDA and Zuken, to support the transfer of data between electronics design and layout software and our electronics simulation portfolio.\nWe have strategic relationships with public cloud providers to enable customers to seamlessly access HPC in the cloud. We have a partnership with Microsoft to develop Ansys Access powered by Azure, which will enable customers to launch Ansys products using their Azure enrollment and connect third-party tools. In addition to our joint initiatives in the cloud, we have a broader relationship with Microsoft focused on more market-specific endeavors in the area of Digital Twins, autonomy and use of AI in simulation.\nWe also have a strategic relationship with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to transform cloud-based engineering simulations. Ansys Gateway powered by AWS facilitates seamless access and deployment of Ansys products on AWS, making simulation workloads more user-friendly, while offering scalability and flexibility with easy access to software and storage solutions from anywhere with a web browser.\nIn addition to marketing relationships to promote the adoption of HPC, we maintain technical relationships with Intel, NVIDIA and AMD to optimize the solver performance and scalability of our portfolio, enabling faster simulations, better graphics and a shorter time to market for our customers. In the area of GPU computing, we have tuned and optimized the Fluent GPU and Mechanical solvers for \"Hopper\" GPUs from NVIDIA. With AMD, we have expanded support in the Ansys Mechanical product for the latest AMD Instinct MI200 Series accelerators, AMD's data-center-class GPU family. Support for these new GPUs gives customers more flexibility when choosing HPC hardware, both on-premises and in the cloud. As an inaugural member, we have joined both Intel Foundry Services' (IFS) Design Ecosystem Alliance and Intel Foundry Services Cloud Alliance. We expect that our EDA tools and multiphysics solutions will help IFS to deliver industry-leading bespoke silicon to their customers, both on-premises and in the cloud.\nOur Partner Program actively encourages developers of specialized software solutions to use our technology as a development platform for their applications and provides customers with enhanced functionality related to their use of our software. With over 350 technology partnerships, spanning a wide range of solution areas, including materials, optimization, electronics, optical, mechanical, fluid and systems simulation, our partner ecosystem extends the depth and breadth of our technology offerings.\nCOMPETITION\nWe believe that there are many factors affecting sales of our software, including ease of use, breadth and depth of functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms, range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and total cost of ownership, customer service and support, company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.\nOur competitors include large, global, publicly traded companies; small, geographically-focused firms; startup firms; and solutions produced in-house by the end users. Some of our current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us, and some have well-established relationships with current and potential customers of ours. Our current and possible future competitors also include firms that have elected, or may in the future elect, to compete by means of open source licensing. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.\nPROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES\nWe regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products. We distribute our software products under software license agreements that predominantly grant customers nonexclusive licenses, which are typically nontransferable, for the use of our products. License agreements for our products are generally directly between us and end users. Use of the licensed software product is restricted to designated sites (LAN License) unless the customer obtains a global license (WAN License) for its use of the software product or the software product is by its nature a global-use product. Customers may also license our software products on a named-user basis, which is deemed to be a global WAN license. Software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of our software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized use, distribution or reproduction. For most products, customers may lease the product on a fixed-term basis for a fee that includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades or may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support and upgrades. For some products, customers purchase an annual subscription for a certain number of named users that includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades or purchase elastic units, which enable the use of any supported product at any time until their licensed volume is met.\nWe license our software products utilizing a combination of web-based and hard-copy license terms and forms. For certain software products, we primarily rely on \"click-wrapped\" licenses (i.e., online agreements where the website provider posts terms and conditions, and the user clicks on the \"accept\" button). The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain.\nWe also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as registered unpublished copyrighted work. We have obtained federal trademark registration protection for Ansys and other marks in the United States and foreign countries. Additionally, we were awarded numerous patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent offices in other jurisdictions and have a number of patent applications pending. To the extent we do not choose to seek patent protection for our intellectual property, we primarily rely on the protection of our source code and underlying functionality as a trade secret.\nOur employees have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information. These agreements, where legally permitted, restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with us anywhere in the world while employed by us (and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter in relevant geographic areas) and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are our property. In addition, we require all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nDespite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our technology and proprietary information (including source code) will be prevented. Further, there can be no assurance that copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret protection will be available for our products in certain jurisdictions, or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with us will be enforceable. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce our rights to our trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce our patent rights and copyrights, and it is possible that, in the future, our competitors may be able to obtain our trade secrets or to independently develop similar technology.\nThe software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various available legal protections of our technology.\nWe do not believe that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. In addition, there are non-practicing entities and patent assertion entities whose business models are built on not producing any products, but rather extracting payments from revenue-generating companies through patent infringement assertions and/or litigation. We expect that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product release delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nSEASONAL VARIATIONS\nOur business has experienced seasonality, including quarterly volatility in software sales driven primarily by the timing of customer renewal cycles. It is typical to see slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months, particularly in Europe, as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of our global customers. Subscription lease and maintenance contract renewals, as well as our revenue, are typically highest in the fourth quarter.\nDEFERRED REVENUE AND BACKLOG\nDeferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from customer agreements. The deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable agreements. Our backlog represents deferred revenue associated with installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and committed contracts with start dates beyond the end of the current period. Our deferred revenue and backlog as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\nRevenue associated with deferred revenue and backlog that will be recognized in the subsequent twelve months is classified as current in the tables above.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt the heart of our culture is a commitment to our people who collectively are powering innovations that drive human advancement. People are our most important investment and our greatest asset. We have a diverse population of talented, qualified and highly-skilled employees at all levels of our organization, including our executive officers, and across our global workforce. The success and the growth of our business depend on our ability to attract, develop, incentivize (and engage/motivate) and retain these employees. We have developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that serve as the framework for our human capital management approach. These strategies, objectives and measures are advanced through several programs, policies and initiatives, including: promoting diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging; employer branding and talent acquisition; and employee training and development. We strive to provide competitive compensation, including incentives linked to Ansys' and employees' performance and competitive benefits programs providing choice and value to our employees. We also seek to enhance the safety and wellness of all employees. We survey employees annually to measure satisfaction and engagement and manage progress.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 6,200 people, including: 2,400 in product development, 3,000 in sales, support and marketing, and 800 in general and administrative functions. Of these employees, 44% were located in the Americas, 29% were located in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and 27% were located in Asia-Pacific (APAC). Certain international employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or have local work councils.\nCulture of Inclusion and Belonging\nDiverse thinking leads to better outcomes. We are committed to creating and nurturing a workplace that fuels this by welcoming people of all backgrounds and identities to bring their talents and experience to a workplace where they are valued and where diversity, inclusion, equity and belonging thrive. This culture fosters higher team intelligence and greater innovation for our customers.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our global self-identified gender diversity was:\n(1)Senior leadership consists of leaders in our executive career track that report directly to the chief executive officer or within one additional reporting level of the chief executive officer and those at the highest tier of our management career track who report directly to a leader on our executive track. The senior leaders, who represent 1% of global employees, are responsible for directing strategic plans aligned with our corporate strategy through multiple levels of management.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our self-identified racial/ethnic diversity was:\n*Other includes Native Hawaiian, American Indian, Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander, two or more races or not applicable.\nWe continue to support employee resource groups to create a culture of inclusion and belonging that increases retention of valuable employees and creates an open culture that fuels innovation. Our employee resource groups include Women in Tech at Ansys, Ansys Pride Alliance, Black Employee Network at Ansys, Veterans at Ansys, Ansys (dis)ability Network and Ansys Latino Connection. Our inclusive culture is further reinforced through education on understanding and mitigating bias in management processes and business decisions.\nEmployee Recruitment, Development and Retention\nOur talent strategy is focused on (i) attracting diverse high-quality talent, (ii) continually developing and engaging our employee base and (iii) retaining our people by recognizing and rewarding performance. Our commitment to recruiting diverse talent is evidenced in the United States through our recruiting efforts at historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic serving institutions, as well as our involvement with minority engineering societies, women in technology groups, veterans' organizations and LGBTQ+A organizations. In addition to targeted outreach, we recruit talent through (i) attending career and networking events aimed towards recruiting diverse audiences, (ii) hiring internally through our Ansys internship/co-op programs for current students and (iii) value partnerships including professional societies that promote our programs to diverse audiences. We continue to evolve our talent acquisition efforts, as evidenced by our expanded events strategy, as well as our priority focus on external partnerships and recruitment tools that expand our reach to diverse audiences. Additionally, we drive a global focus on hiring emerging talent, placing an emphasis on offering full-time positions through our global internship, co-op and new college graduate programs. Our academic product suite is also widely used in research and teaching settings, which allows students to become familiar with our simulation software and creates opportunities to strengthen our university ties and recruit top talent.\nThe development of our employees is paramount to our success and provided through internal professional development programs and tuition assistance for external programs. We conduct annual individual assessments, encourage development planning and build a culture of feedback that drives performance. We drive a variety of focused initiatives specifically designed to support employee development. These include annual talent reviews and succession planning, leadership and executive development and company-sponsored education programs, such as management essentials to develop front-line leaders in foundational people management skills. New programs in 2023 included developing a global mindset, improved new employee orientation and custom learning paths for emerging leaders. We also expanded our Ansys digital academy to be the one-stop-shop for all Ansys developers to build the technical skills needed to support our Pervasive Insights strategy. Additional ongoing programs include mentoring and sponsorship programs and skills development for technical staff in support of the digital transformation of our internal processes.\nDeveloping our employees helps create an engaged workforce that is ready to embrace future business challenges. It also helps mitigate risks associated with employee loss and keeping up with rapid technological and social change. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our annual turnover rate was 5%, or 4% on a voluntary basis.\nCompensation and Benefits Program\nOur compensation programs provide an opportunity for employees to earn higher compensation by aligning their performance, which may include contributions to our environmental, social and governance objectives, with our overall financial and operational success. The program includes three key elements: (i) competitive annual salaries, (ii) annual cash incentives and sales commission programs, with a majority of our employees eligible to earn more or less than the target opportunities based on both our and the employee's performance and (iii) long-term equity incentives with over half of employees receiving equity grants each year in the form of time-based restricted stock units. These grants align the long-term financial interests of our employees with those of our stockholders.\nHealth and welfare benefit programs include market-competitive benefits comprised of a mix of company-provided and other benefits, including those for medical, dental and vision insurance; life and disability insurance; defined contribution retirement plans; and global employee wellness programs. In addition, we offer many different employee assistance programs, such as financial, legal, emotional and social well-being employee assistance programs. Our investments in health and welfare benefits and other employee programs focus on providing choice and value to our employees so they can select market-competitive benefits that support their personal needs.\nLocal regulations are considered when developing our compensation and benefits packages for employees across the globe.\nFlexible Work Environment\nHybrid ways of working continue to enable us to remain productive while meeting customer needs and staying engaged. Our employees continue to respond favorably to the statement: \"I am able to manage my work responsibilities in a way that allows me flexibility.\"\nEmployee Satisfaction and Engagement\nEmployee feedback and engagement are critical to our success. We conduct global employee engagement surveys with the goal of using the feedback to improve the work environment and employee satisfaction. This feedback continues to be a critical component of our listening strategy. The survey itself has become an even more important tool to stay connected with employee sentiment in our hybrid work environments.\nOur 2023 engagement score remained steady compared to 2022, confirming that our employees continue to be highly engaged. Our scores exceeded the external norm across all dimensions of engagement that were measured with themes this year, including: employees feeling valued and part of a team; employees empowered to excel; trust in the future vision that leaders are creating; and employees feeling they have opportunities for learning and development.\nEmployee feedback is also strong in other important areas including communication and overall leadership. These findings continue to help us improve performance, manager effectiveness, culture and engagement.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nInformation about our products and services is available on the internet at www.ansys.com. We provide information for investors on our corporate website under \"Why Ansys - Investor Relations\".\nWe make available, free of charge, the following under \"Why Ansys - Investor Relations\" shortly before or promptly following its first use or release, or as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC, as applicable: financially-related press releases, including earnings releases, various SEC filings, including annual, quarterly and current reports and proxy statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and access to live and recorded audio from investor conference calls or events.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results and an investment in our securities. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated.\nYou should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. In addition, from time to time we provide information, including information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that contains forward-looking statements concerning, among other things, projected financial performance, total addressable market, market and industry sector growth, product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations. Such statements are based on the assumptions and expectations of our management at the time such statements are made. We caution investors that our performance and any forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the following:\nRisks Associated with the Proposed Transaction with Synopsys\nThe proposed transaction with Synopsys may be delayed or not occur at all for a variety of reasons, including that the Merger Agreement is terminated, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Synopsys and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Ansys with Ansys surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys. Completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by a majority of the holders of the outstanding shares of our common stock, (2) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the approval of the Merger under certain other antitrust and foreign investment regimes, (3) the absence of any order, injunction or law prohibiting the Merger, (4) the effectiveness of the registration statement of Synopsys pursuant to which shares of Synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be registered with the SEC, (5) the shares of Synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger being approved for listing on Nasdaq, (6) the accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain standards set forth in the Merger Agreement, (7) compliance in all material respects by the other party with its obligations under the Merger Agreement, and (8) the absence of a continuing material adverse effect with respect to each of Ansys and Synopsys. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed in the expected timeframe (first half of 2025), or at all.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including that either party may have the right to terminate if the Merger is not completed by January 15, 2025, which may be extended to January 15, 2026 as provided in the Merger Agreement. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement, (A) Synopsys, under specified circumstances, including termination following a permanent injunction arising under certain antitrust or foreign investment laws, will be required to pay us a termination fee of $1,500.0 million; and (B) we, under specified circumstances, including our termination of the Merger Agreement to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or Synopsys' termination upon the change by our Board of Directors of its recommendation in favor of the Merger, will be required to pay Synopsys a termination fee of $950.0 million.\nFailure to complete the Merger within the expected timeframe or at all could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022the market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be consummated;\n\u2022if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $950.0 million;\n\u2022we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses for professional services in connection with the Merger for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not consummated; and\n\u2022we may experience negative publicity and/or reactions from our investors, employees, customers, channel partners, and other business partners.\nAdditionally, as Synopsys common stock will be a component of the merger consideration our stockholders will receive in the Merger, our stock price may be adversely impacted by a decline in Synopsys\u2019 stock price and any adverse developments in Synopsys\u2019 business outlook. Synopsys' stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, such as changes in its business operations and outlook, changes in general market and economic conditions, and regulatory considerations. These factors are beyond our control. Also, because the number of shares of Synopsys common stock issuable in connection with the Merger Agreement in respect to one share of Ansys common stock is based on a fixed exchange ratio and the market price of Synopsys common stock may fluctuate, our stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the stock consideration they will receive in exchange for their shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger.\nCompletion of the proposed Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, including certain regulatory approvals which may not be received, may take longer than expected or the receipt of which may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that cannot be met, and if these closing conditions are not satisfied or waived, the proposed Merger will not be completed.\nVarious consents, clearances, approvals, authorizations and declarations of non-objection, or expiration of waiting periods (or extensions thereof), from certain regulatory and governmental authorities in the United States, the European Union and certain other jurisdictions are included in the Merger Agreement as conditions to completing the proposed Merger. Regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on their respective approvals, in which case lengthy negotiations may ensue among such regulatory or governmental entities, Synopsys and Ansys. Such conditions, any such negotiations and the process of obtaining such regulatory approvals, consents or clearances could have the effect of delaying or preventing consummation of the proposed Merger.\nSubject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to consummate the Merger, including cooperating to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to complete the Merger. Nonetheless, certain conditions to the completion of the pending Merger are not within our or Synopsys\u2019 control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, as applicable). There can be no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals or that the pending Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, it is possible conditions will be imposed that could result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the pending Merger or otherwise have an adverse effect on Ansys.\nEfforts to complete the Merger could disrupt our relationships with third parties and employees, divert management\u2019s attention, or result in negative publicity or legal proceedings, any of which could negatively impact our operating results and ongoing business.\nWe have expended, and continue to expend, significant management time and resources in an effort to complete the Merger, which may have a negative impact on our ongoing business and operations. Uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Merger and our future could disrupt our business relationships with our existing and potential customers, channel partners, service providers and other business partners, who may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Ansys. Uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Merger could also adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key personnel and other employees. The pendency of the Merger may also result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the financial markets, and may lead to litigation against us and our directors and officers. Such litigation would be distracting to management and, may, in the future, require us to incur significant costs. Such litigation could result in the Merger being delayed and/or enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, which could prevent the Merger from being completed. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the Merger which could discourage a potential competing acquirer from making an alternative transaction proposal.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that preclude us from soliciting proposals relating to alternative transactions or entering into discussions or negotiations or providing non-public information in connection with any proposal for an alternative transaction from a third party, subject to certain exceptions to permit our Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations. We have further agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with regard to alternative transactions. These prohibitions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer or merger partner from making an alternative transaction proposal. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including, among others, covenants regarding the conduct of our business during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Merger. Although we may be able to pursue such activities with Synopsys\u2019 consent, there is no guarantee that Synopsys will provide us with the necessary consent.\nGlobal Operational Risks\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our operations and financial performance.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global macroeconomic, specific foreign country and U.S. domestic economic conditions. Global inflation and interest rates continued to be elevated throughout 2023. A deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of high inflation, may result in decreased demand for our products and services, constrained credit and liquidity, reduced government spending and volatility in equity and foreign exchange markets. In addition, significant downturns and volatility in the global economy expose us to impairments of certain assets if their values deteriorate. Tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish our future borrowing ability and increase borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities. Customers' ability to pay for our products and services may also be impaired, which could lead to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable.\nFurthermore, escalating global tensions, including due to the deterioration of the diplomatic and political relationships between the United States and other countries where we conduct business, such as China, and the ongoing global volatility due to wars and conflicts (such as those between Russia and Ukraine and/or Israel and Hamas), could adversely affect our future operations and lead to a decline in financial performance.\nA significant portion of our business comes from outside the United States and our customers supply a wide array of goods and services to most of the world's major economic regions. International revenue represented 53.4%, 54.9% and 54.5% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal year 2023, our largest geographic revenue bases were the United States, Japan and Germany.\nWhen the significant economies in which we do business deteriorate or suffer a period of uncertainty, our business and financial performance may be impacted through reduced customer and government spending, changes in purchasing cycles or timing and reduced access to credit for our customers, among other factors. Furthermore, customer spending levels in any foreign jurisdiction may be adversely impacted by changes in domestic policies, including tax and trade policies. A substantial portion of our license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual subscription lease and maintenance contracts, which typically have a high rate of customer renewal. When the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, our subscription lease license and maintenance growth is adversely affected.\nWe are subject to trade restrictions that could impact our ability to sell to customers and result in liabilities for violations.\nDue to the global nature of our business, we are subject to domestic and international trade protection laws, policies, sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. For example, we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations that prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and services to certain countries, regions and persons targeted by the United States and certain end uses identified by the United States, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) administered by the Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC).\nBIS continues to expand its export control restrictions, including with respect to the export to China of certain technologies, impose new export licensing requirements, and require enhanced denied party screening processes. These additional restrictions have limited and could continue to limit our ability to sell and deliver products and services to certain customers, including to entities performing research and development and certain controlled activities in China. Export control restrictions and enhanced screening processes have led to, and, in the future may continue to lead to, elongated transaction cycles with certain customers. In addition, export control restrictions have resulted, and may continue to result, in reduced sales and/or delays in our ability to deliver products and services to certain prospects, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. In certain cases, when an export license may be required to deliver products and services to certain customers, the receipt of licenses to export to certain countries, including China, is not guaranteed and, in the absence of a license or applicable license exception, our ability to sell and deliver products and services to certain customers may be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, BIS continues to add more companies, including existing customers, to its Entity List, and OFAC continues to increase the number of companies subject to its sanctions, which continues to limit the companies with which we can do business.\nAdding companies as restricted parties and subjecting companies to heightened export control restrictions may additionally encourage those companies to seek substitute products from competitors whose products are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own products.\nExisting and prospective customers have been and may continue to be added as restricted parties and/or be subjected to trade restrictions and additional end uses, products or services have been and may continue to be identified for further restrictions. Such actions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, increases to our operating costs and time to market. Additional trade restrictions on our business by the United States, China or other countries may also result in other indirect impacts that cannot be quantified. Restrictions on our ability to sell and ship to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nOur products could also be delivered to restricted parties by third parties, including our channel partners. We take measures to confirm that our channel partners comply with all applicable trade restrictions, but any failure by channel partners to comply with such restrictions could have negative consequences for us.\nViolators of trade restrictions or restricted end uses may be subject to significant penalties, which may include considerable monetary fines, criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees, a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products or services to the federal government. Any such penalties could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. In addition, the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation could cause significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing normal day-to-day operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key talent, our business could be adversely affected.\nDue to the highly technical nature of our products and services, our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain particular employees with specialized skill sets. These skilled roles have been and are expected to continue to be challenging to fill given the recent job market dynamics, including wage inflation and the general labor market shortage, which has caused an increase in competition for talent within the technology industry. Additionally, our talent has been, and continues to be, the subject of recruitment by our competitors and we may incur significant cost to attract and retain our skilled employees. Remote and hybrid options remain the primary means of work. Our working environment options may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain employees who prefer a different working environment. While we have non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with many of our current employees, the enforceability of these agreements may be limited by legislation and by the courts.\nIn addition, our success depends upon the continued service of our senior executives and our key technical and sales employees. Most of these individuals could terminate their relationship with us at any time. The loss of any of them for which there has not been adequate knowledge-sharing and transfer might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and customer relationships.\nWhile we have historically recruited globally for positions in the United States, in recent years our ability to do so has been curbed by more restrictive domestic immigration laws. If the immigration laws become even stricter or the processing of immigration requests becomes even more cumbersome or less efficient, or if we have less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel, our business, reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with global data privacy laws could give rise to regulatory enforcement action, monetary penalties, loss of the ability to do business in certain jurisdictions or reputational harm.\nWe are subject to global data privacy laws and regulations addressing the processing of personal data. As the global focus on data privacy regulation continues to increase, standards governing the processing of personal data continue to become more strict, conflicting and numerous. As a result, potential risks may intensify as our global business pursues data privacy compliance.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (European Union), the Data Protection Act (United Kingdom), the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada), the Personal Information Protection Law (China), the Law Concerning the Protection of Personal Information (Japan), the Personal Information Protection Act (South Korea), many state and federal privacy laws within the United States and other similar global laws in locations in which we do business (collectively, \"Privacy Laws\") govern our global data privacy practices. Additionally, Privacy Laws impose abundant compliance obligations related to our processing of personal data arising from: (i) the delivery of our products and services to our customers; and (ii) our business operations involving employee data.\nCompliance with Privacy Laws has and will continue to require the deployment of substantial resources and increased costs. As the global data privacy landscape continues to change, including: (i) new and varying restrictions on the transfer of personal data across borders; (ii) the growing list of privacy rights afforded to individuals of certain jurisdictions; (iii) data minimization requirements; and (iv) the growing number of governmental agencies dedicated to the preservation of data privacy rights, we may be required to make significant changes to our software applications or business operations. Such changes may increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets, require an investment in additional resources or tools to manage our data privacy compliance, give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers or adversely affect the internal processing of employee information.\nFailure to comply with Privacy Laws may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, loss of the ability to do business in certain jurisdictions or inquiries and investigations into our activities; all of which could result in monetary penalties, reputational damage, lawsuits, extensive and prescriptive consent decrees or judgments. Additional software resources, increased workforce or added expenses may be required to return us to a compliant data privacy status.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe develop and sell software and consulting services and maintain support operations in various countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes. Furthermore, our business is subject to regulation by various global governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, securities laws, laws related to compliance with U.S. government contracts and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Managing these geographically diverse operations requires significant attention and resources to promote compliance.\nOur global reach includes countries considered high-risk environments for public corruption. This exposes us to risks associated with violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. To promote compliance, we forbid our agents, channel partners and employees from engaging in corrupt behavior and we have a compliance program to prevent and detect violations of anti-corruption laws. There remains, however, a risk that illegal conduct could occur thereby exposing us to the financial and reputational risks associated with a violation of anti-corruption laws.\nNon-compliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions and may result in our inability to provide certain products and services to existing or prospective customers. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation or if customers make claims against us for compensation, our business and consolidated financial statements could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees and costs. Enforcement actions and sanctions could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nA catastrophic event or infrastructure failure could result in the loss of business and adverse financial consequences.\nOur personnel, source code and computer equipment is located in various regions throughout the United States and the world. A natural disaster (including significant disruptions in weather as a result of global climate change), cyberattack, terrorist act, pandemic or other unforeseen catastrophe in any of these areas or a breakdown in our business infrastructure, such as an interruption in power supply, telephone system or information technology systems, could cause disruptions to our sales, operations, services and product development activities. As our sales are generally greater at the end of a quarter, the potential adverse effects resulting from any of these events would be accentuated if they occurred at quarter end.\nEffective business continuity, disaster recovery and crisis management plans are critical to minimizing the impact of such unplanned or unexpected events. We also face increasing customer certification requirements with respect to such systems. Failure to establish plans that effectively mitigate the impacts of these disruptions or meet customer certification requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nIndustry Operational Risks\nOur industry is highly competitive, which could result in downward pressure on our prices.\nWe continue to experience competition across all markets for our products and services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, some could establish strategic alliances with one another, and some have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers. Our current and potential competitors also include firms that have competed, or may in the future compete, by means of open source licensing. Companies we have, or could have, strategic alliances with could reduce or discontinue technical, software development and marketing relationships with us for competitive purposes.\nOur competitors may offer deep discounts on certain products or services, or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable. If we are unable to provide products or services that address our customers\u2019 needs or preferences, or we are unable to match favorable pricing offered by our competitors, we could lose customers or fail to attract new customers. Further, we may be required to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms to compete successfully. Our maintenance products, which include software license updates and product support fees, are generally priced as a percentage of new software license fees. Our competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support. Some competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices, product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions. Any of these practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain products.\nFurthermore, if we do not adapt pricing models to reflect changes in customer usage of our products or changes in customer demand, our software license revenues could decrease. Additionally, increased distribution of applications through application service providers, including software-as-a-service providers, may reduce the average price or margin of our products or adversely affect other sales of our products, reducing new software license revenues or profitability.\nThese competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.\nWe may not be successful in integrating emerging technologies or developing and marketing new products to adequately address the rapidly changing technology industry.\nWe operate in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions. A major factor in our future success will be our ability to anticipate technological changes and to integrate emerging technologies (including AI) to develop and introduce, in a timely manner, new products and new ways to deliver them to meet those changes. Our ability to grow revenue will be dependent on our ability to respond to customer needs in the areas of, among others, AI/ML, next generation connectivity, autonomous vehicles, IIoT, electrification and sustainability, and to leverage cloud computing and new computing platforms. In addition, our future success may depend on our ability to continue to develop a systems integrator ecosystem able to handle integrations and process and application development to address the challenge of the increasingly complex integration of our products' different functionalities to address customers' requirements. For those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our business.\nWe devote substantial resources to research and development, which could cause our operating profits to decline.\nWe devote substantial resources to research and development. New competitors, technological advances in the software development industry by us or our competitors, acquisitions, entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, operating profits could decline. In addition, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, new products or product enhancements or that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that we will successfully manage the transition from existing products. Software products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors, defects or vulnerabilities when first introduced or as new versions are released, and the likelihood of errors, defects or vulnerabilities is increased as a result of our commitment to the frequency of product releases.\nThere can be no assurance that errors, defects or vulnerabilities will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments. The occurrence of any defects or errors in our products could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products, delays in payment to us by customers, loss of customers or market share, product returns, damage to our reputation, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions, increased insurance costs and liability for damages.\nCompany Operational Risks\nWe are dependent upon our channel partners for a significant percentage of our revenue and usage of channel partners presents certain heightened compliance risks.\nWe distribute our products through a global network of independent channel partners, which accounted for 26.1%, 23.9% and 23.7% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Channel partners sell our software products to new and existing customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support. A meaningful amount of our APAC and EMEA revenue is from channel partners. Difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners, such as failure to meet performance criteria and differences in handling customer relationships, could adversely affect our performance. Additionally, the loss of any major channel partner, including a channel partner's decision to sell competing products rather than ours, could result in reduced revenue. Moreover, our future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of our channel partners to dedicate the resources necessary to understand and promote our expanding portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base within each of our geographic regions. If the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so, we may be unable to sustain revenue growth.\nEstablishing relationships with new channel partners could result in additional compliance burdens for us. In addition, new channel partners may have a less-established payment history and revenue from these channel partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense. Where channel partners operate on our behalf to collect and process personal data of customer contacts, failure to comply with relevant data privacy laws in the handling of such personal data could result in liability to us for any fines, civil suits or non-financial performance obligations imposed by regulatory authorities on these partners with respect to our customer data.\nCertain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise. Failure of our sales channel, particularly the independent channel partners, to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on our sales in future periods. Any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefit of our acquisitions and such acquisitions could pose risks to our business.\nWe have a track record of acquiring businesses and technology to support our long-term strategic direction.\nEach acquisition that we complete may present risks, including: difficulty in integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures and operations of the companies or businesses; failing to achieve anticipated synergies, including product synergies, revenue increases or cost savings; difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines; difficulty with coordinating and integrating sales, distribution and marketing functions; failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies; disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management's attention to transition or integration issues; liabilities that were not identified during the acquisition process; the loss of our key employees, customers, partners and channel partners or those of the acquired companies or businesses; and cybersecurity and data privacy risks.\nFuture acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant cash resources; the incurrence of debt, which increases our interest expense and leverage; or the issuance of equity, which could be dilutive to stockholders and may decrease earnings per share. We allocate a portion of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets. If we do not realize all the economic benefits of an acquisition, there could be an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. Furthermore, impairment charges are generally not tax-deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded.\nIf we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management or financial and industry analysts, there could be a significant adverse effect on our stock price, business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe ongoing digital transformation of our operational processes may not achieve the benefits identified.\nIn the normal course of our business, we implement new processes, tools and technology to transform our business operations and to enable future scalability. While these transformations are intended to streamline, automate and deliver efficiencies across multiple commercial and operational processes within the business, there is a risk that the systems or processes could be more difficult to implement than anticipated, that the new processes will not be effectively or efficiently used, and that the benefits of such systems and processes could be substantially delayed. There is also a risk that we will have to write off previously capitalized expenditures if the projects are not successful or if implementation decisions regarding the project are modified. Factors that could further delay the timing or impact of benefits realization include (i) changes in leadership and project objectives; (ii) diversion of management's attention to different projects; (iii) additional needs for technical expertise and manpower; and (iv) longer than anticipated time horizon for employee adoption and mastery.\nAny of the above could divert efforts of key operational management away from other aspects of the business, including the maintenance of current commercial and business platforms, and result in increased consulting and software costs. These factors could have a significant negative impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nWe may be subject to proceedings that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits and litigation, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters. Use or distribution of our products could generate product liability, particularly with respect to new ways of going to market, including offering our products in cloud environments, selling software as a service and licensing or otherwise providing our products as part of a third-party developer ecosystem, or regulatory infraction or similar claims by our customers, end users, channel partners, government entities or other third parties. Sales and marketing activities that impact processing of personal data, as well as measures taken to promote license compliance, may also result in claims by customers and individual employees of customers. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements as well as cause reputational damage.\nWe may suffer reputational or financial harm if we have product standard or quality issues.\nWe have separate quality systems and registrations under the ISO 9001:2015 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations. Our continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales. If it was determined that we were not in compliance with various regulatory or ISO 9001 standards, our certificates of registration could be suspended, requiring remedial action and a time-consuming re-registration process. Product quality issues or failures could result in our reputation becoming diminished, resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nOur short-term and long-term sales forecast may not be accurate, which could result in an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles. These long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. Many operational and strategic decisions are based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts. Our sales personnel monitor the status of proposals, including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale, in order to forecast quarterly sales. These forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors, including global economic conditions and the performance of our customers.\nA variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and, therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. Management also forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through long-range planning into budgets, research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties. Global economic conditions, and the effect those conditions and any disruptions in global markets have on our customers, may have a significant impact on the accuracy of our sales forecasts. These conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and our sales forecasts and, as a result, our performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions. This, in turn, could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. To the extent our forecasts are incorrect and, as a result, we fail to meet analyst expectations regarding financial performance or miss or reduce the outlook we give to investors, our share price may be adversely impacted.\nWe may not meet our targets and strategies relating to environmental, social and governance considerations, which could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on our business.\nWe have established targets and strategies related to our reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Our ability to achieve any such targets or strategies is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include, but are not limited to, evolving legal, regulatory and other standards, processes and assumptions, the pace of scientific and technological developments, increased costs, the availability of requisite financing and changes in carbon markets. Failures or delays (whether actual or perceived) in achieving our targets or strategies related to climate change and other environmental matters could adversely affect our business, operations and reputation, and increase risk of litigation.\nFurthermore, many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. We make statements about our environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets and strategies through information provided on our website, press statements and other communications, including through our Corporate Responsibility Report. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these targets and strategies involves risks and uncertainties, including those described under \"Note About Forward-Looking Statements\". In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our targets and strategies and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time. Stakeholders also may have very different views on where environmental, social and governance focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our targets, further our strategies, adhere to public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nAdditionally, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to environmental, social and governance matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital and diversity, are being developed and formalized in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, which may require specific, target-driven frameworks or disclosure requirements. For example, in the United States, the SEC has proposed rules requiring, among other things, disclosure of public companies\u2019 climate-related strategies, costs, impacts and targets. The California Legislature recently passed two bills that will impose climate-related reporting requirements for many companies doing business in the state, including Ansys. Standards for reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required by the SEC or other regulators, are complex and evolving, and the implementation and oversight of controls to comply with applicable reporting and disclosure standards could impose significant compliance costs. In addition, such disclosure requirements could result in revisions to our previous ESG-related disclosures or challenges in meeting evolving and varied regulatory and other stakeholder expectations and standards, which could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and prospects.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nOur success is highly dependent upon the legal protection of our proprietary technology.\nWe primarily rely upon contracts, copyright, patent, trademark and trade secrets laws to protect our technology. We maintain intellectual property programs, including applying for patents, registering trademarks and copyrights, protecting trade secrets, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers and partners and limiting access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. However, software programs are particularly prone to piracy, which is a global phenomenon, and as a result we may lose revenue from piracy or usage and distribution of unlicensed software. Additionally, patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection do not provide the same coverage in every country in which we sell our products and services and some forms of contractual protections (including limited licenses, \"click-wrapped\" licenses and online agreement) may not be adequately enforced. Policing the unauthorized distribution and use of our products is difficult, and software piracy (including online piracy) is a persistent problem. While we continue to develop better mechanisms to detect and report or investigate unauthorized use of our software, we are also constrained by data privacy laws that restrict our ability to collect data about unlawful usage in some countries. We cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology are adequate to prevent misappropriation of our software by third parties, or that third parties will not copy our technology or develop similar technology independently to compete with our products. Despite our efforts to prevent such activities, we may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software or technology.\nIn the event of an infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property, costly and time-consuming litigation may be necessary to enforce our rights. In addition, third parties may subject us to infringement claims with respect to their intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could be costly to defend, damage our reputation and distract our employees from their daily work. Any successful infringement claims asserted against us could require us to develop technology workarounds for the impacted technologies, products or solutions, which could be costly, disrupt product development and delay go-to-market activities. Such disruption and delay could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results.\nWe license third-party software, including third-party open source software, and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in some instances, for inclusion in our products. We also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our solutions and professional services. These licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. Third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors who elect to terminate our contractual relationship. Furthermore, third parties may challenge our use of open source software and compliance with the open source software license terms, or we may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to non-compliance claims. We may, additionally, acquire companies that license third-party software from our competitors or others who may elect to terminate the contractual relationship once the acquisition is announced. If we are unable to obtain licenses to such third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers' usage of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers' ability to utilize our software and our reputation.\nCybersecurity Risks\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims or harm to our reputation.\nWhile we undertake commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of our products, source code, computer systems and data with respect to the relative sensitivity of such software, systems and data, the number of computer \"hackers\" developing and deploying destructive software programs that attack our products and computer systems continues to increase. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to enhance our cybersecurity efforts. Because the tactics and tools used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems are constantly evolving, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Furthermore, employees working from remote work environments could expose us to increased security risks and attacks. Such attacks could disrupt the proper functioning of our products, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, or allow unauthorized access to and disclosure of our sensitive, proprietary or confidential information or that of our customers and employees. In the event of a serious breach of our products or systems, or where a breach occurs due to our failure to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards, our reputation may suffer, customers may stop buying products or may terminate current services, we could face lawsuits and potential civil liability, as well as regulatory fines and non-financial penalties for any personal data breach and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nThere is also a danger of industrial espionage, cyberattacks (including state-sponsored attacks), misuse, theft of information or assets (including source code) or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities, systems or information. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience such attacks. This includes access to systems or information through email phishing attacks on our employees, which has become a very prevalent technique used against companies, often delaying detection through increasingly complex practices. The objective of these attacks is often to acquire user account credentials in order to access other computer systems through linked accounts or where users have recycled passwords across systems. There is also risk of infection of software while it is under assembly, known as a supply chain attack. As a software provider, there is the risk that we could become the subject of a significant network breach through our usage of compromised third-party software. Similarly, the subversion of popular open source modules presents a widespread and ongoing risk across the software development sector. Increasing use of artificial intelligence may increase these risks.\nInadequate security practices or inadvertent acts or omissions by our employees and partners may also result in unauthorized access to our data. Employees or third parties may also intentionally compromise our or our customers' security or systems. Such cybersecurity breaches, misuse of data or other disruptions could lead to loss of or unauthorized disclosure of our source code or other confidential information, unlicensed use and distribution of our products without compensation, illegal use of our products that could jeopardize the security of customer information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and theft, manipulation and destruction of proprietary data, resulting in defective products, performance downtimes and possible violation of export laws and other regulatory compliance requirements. Although we actively employ measures to combat such activities, preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data is inherently difficult. In addition, litigation to either pursue our legal rights or defend any claims against us could be costly and time-consuming and may divert management's attention and adversely affect the market's perception of us and our products.\nWe have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity attacks and incidents in the past that have resulted in unauthorized persons gaining access to our information and systems, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack described herein has had a material impact on our business or consolidated financial statements.\nA number of our core processes, such as software development, sales and marketing, customer service and financial transactions, rely on IT infrastructure and applications. We also rely on third-party service providers and products, which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities outside of our control. Malicious software, sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of our infrastructure, which could cause short-term disruption in operations or, in the event of a longer disruption, lead to a substantial denial of service to our customers and ultimately to production downtime, recovery costs and customer claims for breach of contract, as well as reputational damage and impact to employee morale and productivity.\nWe rely on service providers for infrastructure and cloud-based products.\nWe use a number of third-party service providers, which we do not control, for key components of our infrastructure, particularly with respect to development and delivery of our cloud-based products. The utilization of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored, scalable customer experience, but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities. Third-party service providers operate their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service interruptions. We may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our third-party service providers' infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters (including significant disruptions in weather as a result of global climate change), fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Such outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of credits to our cloud-based product customers, which may impact our business and consolidated financial statements. In addition, those of our products and services that depend upon hosted components are vulnerable to security risks inherent in web-based technologies, including greater risk of unauthorized access to or use of customers' protected data. Interception of data transmission, misappropriation or modification of data, corruption of data and attacks by bad actors against our service providers may also adversely affect our products or product and service delivery. Malicious code, viruses or vulnerabilities that are undetected by our service providers may disrupt our business operations generally and may have a disproportionate effect on those of our products that are developed and delivered in the cloud environment. If our security, or that of any of our third-party service providers, is compromised, our software is unavailable or our customers are unable to use our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.\nThese risks, though largely outside our control, may impact customer perception of our products, service and support, and may damage our brand. While we devote resources to maintaining the security and integrity of our products and systems, as well as ensuring adequate due diligence for our third-party service providers, cloud security and reliability is inherently challenging. In the event of a material breach of data hosted by our service providers or a serious security incident on behalf of, caused by or experienced by a service provider, we may experience significant operational and technical difficulties, loss of data including customer data, diminished competitive position or reputation and loss of customer engagement, which could result in civil liabilities and a negative impact to financial performance. It is also possible that our customers and potential customers would hold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a third-party service provider's infrastructure and we may incur significant liability from those customers and from third parties with respect to any breach affecting these systems. We may not be able to recover a material portion of our liabilities to our customers and third parties from a third-party cloud provider.\nFinancial Risks\nForeign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nAs a result of our significant international presence, we have revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies, most notably the Euro and Japanese Yen. Our operating results are adversely affected when the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies and are positively affected when the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to foreign currencies. Additionally, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, certain channel partners who pay us in U.S. Dollars may have trouble paying on time or may have trouble distributing our products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on their cash flows. This may impact our ability to distribute our products into certain regions and markets.\nWe seek to reduce our currency exchange transaction risks primarily through our normal operating and treasury activities, including derivative instruments, but there can be no assurance that these activities will be successful in reducing these risks. In addition, we incur transaction fees in the usage of such derivative instruments. Changes in currency exchange rates may adversely affect or create considerable volatility in our consolidated financial statements.\nChanges to tax laws, variable tax estimates and tax authority audits could impact our financial results and operations.\nOur operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. A change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates, an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which we have significant deferred tax assets, could result in a material increase in tax expense. Furthermore, we have recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are generally not deductible for tax purposes. These deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded. Any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate during that period. Additionally, changes in tax laws could impact operating cash flow due to changes in timing of payments required as well as the overall rate we are required to pay.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\"), in coordination with the G20, has suggested a number of fundamental changes as part of an effort to address the global tax issue of base erosion and profit shifting. In particular, and as a way to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy, the OECD has introduced a two-pillar approach which provides for the allocation of profits among taxing jurisdictions in which companies do business, and the implementation of a 15 percent global minimum tax rate (namely the \"Pillar One\" and \"Pillar Two\" proposals). The agreement between OECD and G20 members calls for implementation of the various measures of the Pillar Two rules in 2024 and 2025. Many countries are in the process of implementing laws based on the Pillar Two proposal which may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, net income, and cash flows depending on the specifics of the laws passed in each jurisdiction. These proposals also entail significant compliance obligations and if we are unable to successfully transition our business systems, processes and internal controls, it could impact our ability to meet financial and tax reporting deadlines.\nWe also make significant estimates in determining our worldwide income tax provision. These estimates involve complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. These audits can result in additional assessments, including interest and penalties. Our estimates for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions are highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities, including estimates for uncertain tax positions, in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have outstanding borrowings of $755.0 million under a term loan facility, which matures on June 30, 2027. We also have access to a $500.0 million revolving loan facility, which includes a $50.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The credit agreement governing these loans contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The credit agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio not in excess of 3.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter (for the four-quarter period ending on such date) with an opportunity for a temporary increase in such consolidated net leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 upon the consummation of certain qualified acquisitions for which the aggregate consideration is at least $250.0 million.\nNotwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our term loan facility and revolving loan facility, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our level of debt could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and other ongoing business obligations, which may result in defaults;\n\u2022result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement governing our debt, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which can adversely impact our operating cash flow;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate and the overall economy;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing; and\n\u2022increase our effective tax rate as interest expense could become non-deductible.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreement.",

See the section entitled \u201cCybersecurity Risks\u201d in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our cybersecurity program is led by an experienced team of cybersecurity professionals headed by our Vice President of Cybersecurity, reporting to our General Counsel.\nOur Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) is part of our cybersecurity program and operates under the Ansys CSMS Risk Management Methodology and Policy (Policy), which establishes a process to identify, assess and mitigate potential cybersecurity threats. The Policy provides for conducting risk assessments to identify Ansys information assets (such as software assets or data), identifying potential vulnerabilities related to those assets, assessing the potential impact should the vulnerability be exploited and working with our internal cybersecurity team to provide recommendations to eliminate or mitigate the potential risk. The risk assessments allow our management to validate threats and investigate potential vulnerabilities to more effectively make risk management decisions and assign resources to mitigate risk.\nOur CSMS uses third-party software to identify and prioritize cybersecurity threats and has dedicated personnel whose core responsibilities are to document and track cybersecurity threats. We use security technology tools and methodologies to protect our information systems. We also use tools for risk and vulnerability management and perform periodic penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. Further, we provide our employees information security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter.\nWe conduct an enterprise risk assessment that is updated on an annual basis and includes periodic monitoring of new and emerging risks and preparation for and progress on mitigation efforts. Cybersecurity is directly integrated into this process as an operational risk and has been classified within the enterprise risk management program based on the risk assessment. Any identified gaps are incorporated and monitored through a cybersecurity roadmap, with progress reported to management. Controls put in place to manage any identified risks are evaluated against an established risk-mitigation framework.\nWe engage multiple third-party consultants to advise us on our cybersecurity processes. We conduct external, third-party assessments of our cybersecurity program against specified industry frameworks, as well as annual re-assessments designed to help us understand program changes and the impact that they have had on overall program maturity. Additionally, we engage an external third-party penetration testing entity to measure the effectiveness of our cybersecurity strategy against cybersecurity threats.\nLastly, we use third-party intelligence resources to help identify cybersecurity threats via finished intelligence, alerts and consulting services that help answer requests for information. We have collaborative relationships with The Information Technology - Information Sharing and Analysis Center and several governmental agencies for identification of threats that target technology.\nAnsys also has an established Third-Party Risk Management Program and Policy that is designed to identify and manage cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service providers. The program includes processes designed to identify, assess and mitigate and/or manage third-party service provider risks. Under the Third-Party Risk Management Program and Policy, we evaluate third-party service providers through five stages: planning, due diligence, contracting/onboarding, ongoing monitoring and termination/off-boarding.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, experience cybersecurity incidents. Although prior incidents have not materially affected Ansys, future incidents from cybersecurity threats could have a materially adverse impact on us, including on our reputation, the results of our operations and our financial condition and could implicate lawsuits and potential civil liability, as well as regulatory fines and non-financial penalties.\nGovernance\nOur cybersecurity program is overseen by the Audit Committee of the Ansys Board of Directors. This oversight is anchored in the Audit Committee\u2019s charter, which specifically grants the Audit Committee oversight responsibility on our risks related to cybersecurity, including a review of the state of our cybersecurity program, emerging cybersecurity developments and threats and our strategy to mitigate cybersecurity risks. The Senior Director of Internal Audit and Risk Management, with input from the Vice President of Cybersecurity, reports on the status of the cybersecurity program to the Audit Committee and, periodically or where appropriate, to the Ansys Board of Directors. These reports generally include recent updates and improvements to the cybersecurity program, information on the cybersecurity program\u2019s status and intelligence on recent cybersecurity threats, actions we have taken to mitigate such threats and recent material incidents, or potentially material incidents, if any. In addition, the Senior Director of Internal Audit and Risk Management reports to the Audit Committee on the enterprise risk management program, which includes risks associated with cybersecurity.\nOur cybersecurity program, and its associated CSMS, is led by an experienced team of cybersecurity professionals headed by the Vice President of Cybersecurity. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we have a dedicated Cybersecurity Incident Response Team that is responsible for identifying, escalating, responding to and managing cybersecurity incidents, including interdiction and remediation, as well as conducting the initial investigation, gathering and analyzing data, mitigating damage to the informational assets and infrastructure of Ansys, restoring normal services and system integrity and implementing actions designed to prevent future cybersecurity incidents. This team reports to the Vice President of Cybersecurity. In the event of a significant cybersecurity incident, a cross-functional team comprised of cyber, legal and finance personnel work together to determine the materiality of an incident.\nOur Cybersecurity Steering Committee, which includes the Vice President of Cybersecurity and several members of management, is responsible for the oversight of our cybersecurity program. The Vice President of Cybersecurity has over 20 years of experience in cybersecurity. Members of this committee include our General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer and the Senior Director of Internal Audit and Risk Management, all of whom have significant experience in managing enterprise risk, including risk from cybersecurity threats. The Cybersecurity Steering Committee meets routinely to discuss the status of the cybersecurity program, the status of responses to cybersecurity incidents or threats, any updates on certification programs and any emerging cybersecurity threats. Information received by management through the Cybersecurity Steering Committee is regularly included in the quarterly updates to the Audit Committee.",

    "item_7": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This section generally discusses our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. For discussion and analysis of our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2023.\nBusiness\nAnsys, a corporation formed in 1994, develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia, including high-tech, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, industrial equipment, materials and chemicals, consumer products, healthcare and construction. Headquartered south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we employed 6,200 and 5,600 people as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We focus on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs on-premises and/or via the cloud, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing, validation and deployment. We distribute our suite of simulation technologies through direct sales offices in strategic, global locations and a global network of independent resellers and distributors (collectively, channel partners). It is our intention to continue to maintain this hybrid sales and distribution model. We operate and report as one segment.\nWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality using Ansys simulation. For more than 50 years, Ansys software has enabled innovators across industries to push the boundaries of product design by using the predictive power of simulation. From sustainable transportation and advanced satellite systems to life-saving medical devices, Ansys powers innovation that drives human advancement.\nOur strategy of Pervasive Insights seeks to deepen the use of simulation in our core market, to inject simulation throughout the product lifecycle and extend the accessibility to a broader set of users and use cases. Our business has three vectors of growth:\n\u2022More products. Our broad and deep multiphysics portfolio enables us to grow with customers as they use simulation to solve more complex problems across a broad set of industries.\n\u2022More users. Investments in simulation education and user experience simplification has made simulation more accessible to a broader user base.\n\u2022More computations. Larger and more complex simulations drive more computation, requiring customers to use more Ansys licenses to complete their simulations.\nThrough decades of investments in the academic community and enhanced user experiences, our solutions have become accessible and relevant beyond our core \"engineering\" end user, to reach more users upstream and downstream from our core, which is the product validation process. Our multiphysics solutions enable our customers to address increasingly complex R&D challenges from the component through the system and mission level of analysis. Our products seamlessly enable access to high performance compute capacity to run simulations, on-premises or in the cloud, which means our customers' R&D teams are unencumbered by compute capacity limitations that can hinder R&D cycle times. Our investments in artificial intelligence capabilities across our simulation portfolio and technical support services enhance the customer experience, democratize simulation and further next-generation innovation.\nThe engineering software simulation market is strong and growing. The market growth is driven by customers' need for rapid, quality innovation in a cost-efficient manner, enabling faster time to market for new products and lower warranty costs. Increasing product complexity is driving sustained demand for simulations. Key industry trends fueling customers' increasing needs for simulation include:\n\u2022Electrification;\n\u2022Autonomy;\n\u2022Connectivity;\n\u2022IIoT; and\n\u2022Sustainability, including minimizing waste and physical prototyping, and improving circularity and development time.\nWe have been investing and intend to continue to invest in our portfolio to broaden the range of physics and enable customers to analyze the interactions among physics at the component, system and mission level. Our strategy of Pervasive Insights is aligned with the near-term market growth opportunities and is laying the foundation for a future where simulation can be further democratized to broader classes of end-users and end-use cases. In addition, we have and will continue to partner with industry leaders to extend simulation into other ecosystems and customer R&D workflows.\nWe license our technology to businesses in a diverse set of industries, educational institutions and governmental agencies. We believe that the features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products are as strong as they have ever been. The software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles which increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. We make many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts that are impacted not only by these long sales cycles, but also by current global economic conditions. As a result, we believe that our overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results. Please see the sub-section entitled \"Company Operational Risks\" under Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the potential impact of our sales forecasts on our financial condition, cash flows and operating results.\nWe address the competition and price pressure that we face in the short- and long-term by focusing on expanding the breadth, depth, ease of use and quality of the technologies, features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products as compared to our competitors; investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increasing the capabilities of our existing products; maintaining a diverse industry footprint and focusing on customer needs, training, consulting and support; and enhancing our distribution channels. We also evaluate and execute strategic acquisitions to supplement our global engineering talent, product offerings and distribution channels.\nSynopsys Merger Agreement\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Synopsys and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Ansys, with Ansys surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys. Our Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement, resolved to recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is consummated, our common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) 0.3450 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Synopsys and (ii) $197.00 in cash, without interest, subject to applicable withholding taxes. With regard to the Stock Consideration, if the aggregate number of shares of Synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger would exceed the Maximum Share Number, (a) the Exchange Ratio will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary such that the aggregate number of shares of Synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger does not exceed the Maximum Share Number and (b) the Per Share Cash Amount will be correspondingly increased to offset such adjustment.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by each of Ansys, Synopsys, and Merger Sub, including, among others, covenants regarding the conduct of our and Synopsys\u2019 businesses during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the making of certain public disclosures and other matters as described in the Merger Agreement. We and Synopsys have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to consummate the Merger, including cooperating to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to complete the Merger. We have agreed not to, among other things, (a) solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions or (b) enter into discussions or negotiations or provide non-public information in connection with any proposal for an alternative transaction from a third party, subject to certain exceptions to permit our Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations. We have further agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with regard to alternative transactions.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including that either party may have the right to terminate if the Merger is not completed by January 15, 2025, which may be extended to January 15, 2026 as provided in the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, (A) Synopsys, under specified circumstances, including termination following an injunction arising in connection with certain antitrust or foreign investment laws, will be required to pay us a termination fee of $1,500.0 million; and (B) we, under specified circumstances, including our termination of the Merger Agreement to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or Synopsys' termination upon the change by our Board of Directors of its recommendation in favor of the Merger, will be required to pay Synopsys a termination fee of $950.0 million.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, approval of the Merger under certain applicable antitrust and foreign investment regimes and the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders. We anticipate the transaction to close in the first half of 2025.\nOverview\nOverall GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\nThis section includes a discussion of GAAP and Non-GAAP results. For reconciliations of Non-GAAP results to GAAP results, see the section titled \"Non-GAAP Results\" herein.\nThe 2023 period non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items. The 2022 period non-GAAP results also exclude the income statement effects of acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022. This adjustment is not material in 2023.\nOur GAAP and non-GAAP results for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 reflected the following variances:\nOur results reflect an increase in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 due to growth in subscription lease license, maintenance and service revenue. We also experienced increased operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increased personnel costs. The actual U.S. Dollar reported results were impacted by a stronger U.S. Dollar.\nThis section also includes a discussion of constant currency results, which we use for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure. All constant currency results presented in this Item 7 exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2023 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2022 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2023. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2023 reported amounts by the 2023 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2022 comparable period reported amounts.\nImpact of Foreign Currency\nOur comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The impacts on our revenue and operating income as a result of the fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar when measured against our foreign currencies based on 2022 exchange rates are reflected in the table below. Amounts in brackets indicate an adverse impact from currency fluctuations.\nIn constant currency, our variances were as follows:\nOther Key Business Metric\nAnnual Contract Value (ACV) is a key performance metric and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business. ACV is a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. Over the life of the contract, ACV equals the total value realized from a customer. ACV is not impacted by the timing of license revenue recognition. ACV is used by management in financial and operational decision-making and in setting sales targets used for compensation. ACV is not a replacement for, and should be viewed independently of, GAAP revenue and deferred revenue as ACV is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following:\n\u2022the annualized value of maintenance and subscription lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus\n\u2022the value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plus\n\u2022the annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus\n\u2022the value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts.\nWhen we refer to the anniversary dates in the definition of ACV above, we are referencing the date of the beginning of the next twelve-month period in a contractually committed multi-year contract. If a contract is three years in duration, with a start date of July 1, 2023, the anniversary dates would be July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025. We label these anniversary dates as they are contractually committed. While this contract would be up for renewal on July 1, 2026, our ACV performance metric does not assume any contract renewals.\nExample 1: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $100,000 subscription lease contract or a $100,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV for fiscal year 2023 with no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2024.\nExample 2: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $300,000 subscription lease contract or a $300,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2026, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV in each of fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025. There would be no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2026 as each period captures the full annual value upon the anniversary date.\nExample 3: A perpetual license valued at $200,000 with a contract start date of March 1, 2023 would contribute $200,000 to ACV in fiscal year 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 our ACV was as follows:\nRecurring ACV includes both subscription lease license and maintenance ACV and excludes perpetual license and service ACV.\nIndustry Commentary\nIn 2023, ACV growth was broad based across industries. Our core industries of high-tech, aerospace and defense (A&D) and automotive experienced growth as we continue to see trends, such as generative AI, pervasive connectivity and electrification, transform industry landscapes. Our technology remains a vital component to our customers\u2019 success as the need for innovation and agility reaches new heights. In the high-tech industry, the proliferation of connected devices is driving more applications for analog chips across industries, including automotive and healthcare. In tandem, our customers continue to invest in our solutions to develop advanced packaging technologies, such as 3D-IC, to overcome integration density constraints and meet the needs of compute-intensive applications, such as AI/ML. Within the automotive industry, our simulation solutions remain vital components in the development and validation of safe, reliable ADAS features, electrified powertrains and software-defined vehicles. Additionally, in the A&D industry, our modeling and simulation capabilities remain central to the development and deployment of more efficient aircraft, the advanced air mobility segment and increasingly complex defense technology.\nGeographic Trends\nThe following table presents our geographic revenue variances using actual and constant currency rates during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022:\nRevenue results from region to region can fluctuate due to the timing, duration and size of multi-year lease subscription contracts in any particular period and are not necessarily indicative of the underlying operational performance. To drive growth, we continue to focus on a number of sales improvement activities across the geographic regions, including sales hiring, pipeline building, productivity initiatives and customer engagement activities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, trade restrictions limited the sale of certain Ansys products and services to entities performing research & development and certain controlled activities in China. Additional restrictions or a further deterioration in the global trade environment could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Part I, Item 1A herein for a discussion of additional business risks, including those associated with the export of certain technologies to China.\nAcquisitions\nWe make targeted acquisitions in order to support our long-term strategic direction, accelerate innovation, provide increased capabilities to our existing products, supply new products and services, expand our customer base and enhance our distribution channels.\nOn January 3, 2023, we completed the acquisition of DYNAmore for a purchase price of $139.2 million, or $126.4 million net of cash acquired. The acquisition expands our position as a simulation solution provider within the automotive industry. The effects of the acquisition were not material to our consolidated results of operations.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we completed other acquisitions to expand our solution offerings and enhance our customers' experience. The effects of the acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations individually or in the aggregate. The combined purchase price of these acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $94.4 million, or $88.3 million net of cash acquired, and $401.7 million, or $390.8 million net of cash acquired, respectively.\nFor further information on our business combinations during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations discussed below are on a GAAP basis unless otherwise stated.\nFor purposes of the following discussion and analysis, the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2023 and 2022. The operating results of our acquisitions have been included in the results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenue:\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 9.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, or 10.2% in constant currency. Maintenance revenue growth of 9.9%, or 10.3% in constant currency, is correlated with the license sales discussed later in this paragraph and is driven substantially by our existing customer base. The reported $99.3 million growth in maintenance revenue was attributable to a $95.8 million increase in maintenance associated with lease licenses and a $3.5 million increase in maintenance associated with perpetual sales. Subscription lease license revenue increased 14.3%, or 14.4% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, with substantially all of the increase attributable to additional sales to our existing customers. The reported $98.4 million increase in lease license revenue was attributable to a $83.8 million increase in value from multi-year licenses and a $14.6 million increase in value from annual licenses.\nWe continue to experience increased demand from our customers for contracts that often include longer-term, subscription leases involving a larger number of our software products. These arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price. The upfront recognition of license revenue related to these larger transactions can result in significant subscription lease revenue volatility. Software products, across a large variety of applications and industries, are increasingly distributed in software-as-a-service, cloud and other subscription environments in which the licensing approach is time-based rather than perpetual. This preference could result in a shift from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses, such as subscription leases, over the long term.\nWith respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2023, the U.S. Dollar was 0.6% stronger, when measured against our foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2022. The table below presents the net impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations.\nAs a percentage of revenue, our international and domestic revenues, and our direct and indirect revenues, were as follows:\nCost of Sales and Operating Expenses:\nThe tables below reflect our operating results on both a GAAP and constant currency basis. Amounts included in the discussions that follow each table are provided in constant currency and are inclusive of costs related to our acquisitions. The impact of foreign exchange translation is discussed separately, where material.\nSoftware Licenses: The increase in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to increased third-party royalties of $7.1 million.\nAmortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets.\nMaintenance and Service: The net increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Increased stock-based compensation of $3.3 million.\n\u2022Decreased salaries of $1.2 million.\nThe improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue.\nSelling, General and Administrative: The net increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $50.2 million.\n\u2022Increased stock-based compensation of $33.1 million.\n\u2022Increased business travel of $8.1 million as in-person meetings and live attendance at trade events have continued to expand.\n\u2022Increased IT maintenance and software hosting costs of $3.0 million.\n\u2022Decreased third-party commissions of $6.3 million.\n\u2022Decreased costs related to foreign exchange translation of $3.5 million due to a stronger U.S. Dollar.\n\u2022Decreased bad debt expense of $3.5 million.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to make targeted investments in our global sales and marketing organizations and our global business infrastructure to enhance and support our revenue-generating activities.\nResearch and Development: The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related expenses of $41.0 million.\n\u2022Increased stock-based compensation of $17.4 million.\n\u2022Increased IT maintenance and software hosting costs of $2.9 million.\nAmortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets.\nWe have traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intend to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of our broad portfolio of simulation software products.\nOverall, the impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in decreased operating income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest Income: Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $19.6 million as compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The higher interest rate environment and the related increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances was partially offset by a lower invested cash balance as a result of investments in acquisitions and share repurchases.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $47.1 million as compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to a higher interest rate environment.\nOther Expense, net: Our other expense consisted of the following:\nIncome Tax Provision: Our income before income tax provision, income tax provision and effective tax rate were as follows:\nThe increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to a non-recurring benefit in 2022 of $22.8 million related to U.S. tax benefits on foreign earnings from entity structuring activities, a decrease in benefits related to stock-based compensation of $9.0 million, a non-recurring benefit in 2022 of $8.7 million related to Extraterritorial Income Exclusions from prior periods and an $8.3 million decrease in the benefit related to foreign-derived intangible income (FDII). These increases were offset by a $10.6 million decrease in tax related to global intangible low-taxed income as a result of a change in estimate from the prior year.\nWhen compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate for each respective period, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from the FDII deduction and research and development credits, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible compensation.\nNet Income: Our net income, diluted earnings per share and weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were as follows:\nNon-GAAP Results\nWe provide non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most comparable GAAP financial measure are included below, as applicable.\n1 Diluted weighted average shares were 87,386.\n1 Diluted weighted average shares were 87,490.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.\nWhile we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:\nAcquisition accounting for deferred revenue. Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives. Under prior accounting guidance, a fair value provision resulted in acquired deferred revenue that was often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that was lower than the historical carrying value. Although this fair value provision has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In 2022, we adopted accounting guidance which eliminates the fair value provision that resulted in the deferred revenue adjustment on a prospective basis. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we have historically provided non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment for acquisitions prior to the adoption of the new guidance in 2022. The 2022 non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document include the adjustment to exclude the income statement effects of acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022. There is no adjustment included for 2023 as the impact is not material.\nAmortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.\nStock-based compensation expense. We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our Board of Directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager\u2019s performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors\u2019 operating results.\nExpenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. We also incur other expenses directly related to business combinations, including compensation expenses and concurrent restructuring activities, such as employee severances and other exit costs. These costs are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses. We exclude these acquisition-related expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors\u2019 operating results.\nNon-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we re-evaluate and update this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below:\nGAAP Reporting Measure Non-GAAP Reporting Measure\nRevenue Non-GAAP Revenue\nGross Profit Non-GAAP Gross Profit\nGross Profit Margin Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin\nOperating Income Non-GAAP Operating Income\nOperating Profit Margin Non-GAAP Operating Profit Margin\nNet Income Non-GAAP Net Income\nDiluted Earnings Per Share Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share\nConstant currency. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures detailed above, we use constant currency results for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2023 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2022 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2023. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2023 reported amounts by the 2023 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing the adjusted amounts to the 2022 comparable period reported amounts. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our reported results to our past reports of financial results without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks. Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year. The following table presents our foreign and domestic holdings of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nIn general, it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts. Substantially all of the pre-2018 earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and post-2018 current earnings are taxed as part of global intangible low-taxed income tax expense. These taxes increase our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual U.S. federal tax. Unrecognized provisions for taxes on indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries would not be significant.\nThe amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during the current fiscal year due to increased customer receipts driven primarily by ACV growth, partially offset by payments related to higher operating expenses, interest payments due to the higher interest rate environment as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 and increased income tax payments associated with higher taxable income.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to decreased cash outlays for acquisitions of $177.4 million. We currently plan capital spending of $40.0 million to $50.0 million during fiscal year 2024 as compared to the $25.3 million that was spent in fiscal year 2023. The level of spending will depend on various factors, including the growth of the business and general economic conditions.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased during the current fiscal year primarily due to decreased stock repurchases of $9.1 million and increased proceeds from shares issued for stock-based compensation of $4.5 million.\nOther Cash Flow Information\nOn June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) with PNC Bank, National Association as administrative agent, swing line lender, and an L/C issuer, the lenders party thereto, and the other L/C issuers party thereto. The 2022 Credit Agreement refinanced our previous credit agreements in their entirety. The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for a $755.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $500.0 million unsecured revolving loan facility, which includes a $50.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Terms used in this description of the 2022 Credit Agreement with initial capital letters that are not otherwise defined herein are as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our term loan was $753.9 million, with no principal payments due in the next twelve months. Borrowings under the term loan and revolving loan facilities accrue interest at a rate that is based on the Term SOFR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus 0.500%, (ii) the PNC Bank, National Association prime rate, and (iii) Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment for SOFR plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available).\nOn September 29, 2023, the 2022 Credit Agreement was amended to provide for an interest rate adjustment (Sustainability Rate Adjustment) based upon the achievement of certain environmental, social and governance key performance indicators (KPIs). The Sustainability Rate Adjustment range is +/- 0.05% and will go into effect in the first quarter of 2024 based on the 2023 KPIs and will be adjusted annually based on the KPIs of the preceding year.\nThe rate in effect for the first quarter of 2024 under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 6.32%.\nWe previously entered into operating lease commitments, primarily for our domestic and international offices. The commitments related to these operating leases is $137.6 million, of which $27.0 million is due in the next twelve months.\nUnder our stock repurchase program, we repurchased shares as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, 1.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program. Average price paid per share excludes excise tax. As of January 1, 2023, our share repurchases in excess of issuances are subject to a 1% excise tax enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act. As of December 31, 2023, we had $0.1 million of accrued excise tax. Any excise tax incurred is recognized and reflected as part of the cost basis of the shares acquired in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. The authorized repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nWe continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believe that the best uses of our excess cash are to invest in the business; acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, services and technologies; and make payments on our outstanding debt balances. Any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, debt financing or the issuance of additional securities.\nWe believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, together with cash generated from operations and access to the $500.0 million revolving loan facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements and contractual obligations through at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings. However, future disruptions in the capital markets could make financing more challenging and there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nContractual and Other Obligations\nOur significant contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2023 are summarized below:\n(1)Borrowings under long-term debt accrue interest at a rate that is based on the Term SOFR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus 0.500%, (ii) the PNC Bank, National Association prime rate, and (iii) Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment for SOFR plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available). As the interest rate is variable, interest on the long-term debt is estimated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2023. For additional information, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(2)We previously entered into a lease agreement for 186,000 square feet of rentable space located in an office facility in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, which serves as our headquarters. The term of the lease is 183 months, beginning on October 1, 2014 and expiring on December 31, 2029. We have a one-time right to terminate the lease on December 31, 2025 by providing the landlord with at least 18 months' prior written notice of such termination.\n(3)Other operating leases primarily include lease commitments for our other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment.\n(4)Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include minimum royalty contracts, software licenses and support, and network services, which are unrecorded as of December 31, 2023. The unconditional purchase obligations are in addition to the current and long-term liabilities recorded on our December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet.\n(5)We have $54.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. As a result, such amounts are excluded from the table above.\n(6)On December 5, 2023, we entered into an agreement to make a strategic equity investment. The investment is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2024.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $950.0 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe accounting policies, methods and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The most critical accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing our consolidated financial statements involved:\n\u2022Revenue recognition;\n\u2022Valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations; and\n\u2022Income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription\nOur revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. We enter into contracts that include combinations of products, maintenance and services, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns.\nJudgments and Estimates\nOur contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer. Judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations, and if so, to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. We use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for each performance obligation. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.\nOur time-based subscription lease license contracts with customers are sold as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license as well as post-contract support (PCS), which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. Revenue is recognized up front at the commencement of the lease for the term software lease license and recognized ratably over the term of the contract for the PCS in the arrangement. Utilizing observable inputs, we determined that 50% of the estimated standalone selling price of the subscription lease license is attributable to the term software license, while 50% is attributable to PCS. This determination involved judgment, particularly as it relates to the value relationship between our PCS and subscription lease licenses, the value relationship between PCS and our perpetual licenses and its linkage to the shortened term of a subscription lease license, the average economic life of our software, renewal rates of our customers and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach.\nChanges in these estimates could significantly impact the recognition of revenue in a given period.\nValuation of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations\nDescription\nIn accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.\nJudgments and Estimates\nDetermining these fair values requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to acquired intangible assets. We determined the fair value of our intangible assets using various valuation techniques, including the relief-from-royalty method and the multi-period excess earnings method. These models utilize certain unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: royalty rate, discount rate, customer attrition rate and obsolescence rate. The fair values of the intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives.\nIf actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our business acquisitions.\nIncome Taxes\nDescription\nOur income tax expense reflects management's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.\nAdditionally, as part of our accounting for income taxes, tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of limitations remains open.\nJudgments and Estimates\nWe are subject to tax in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgements and estimates are required in the determination of consolidated income tax expense. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgement and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. In the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value, the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We adjust the liabilities when our judgement changes as a result of new information not previously available.\nAlthough we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Guidance\nFor information regarding recent accounting guidance and its impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. As we operate in international regions, a portion of our revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations are denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates will affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We seek to reduce our currency exchange transaction risks primarily through our normal operating and treasury activities, including the use of derivative instruments.\nWith respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2023, the U.S. Dollar was 0.6% stronger, when measured against our foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2022. The table below presents the net impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations.\nThe impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in decreased operating income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nA hypothetical 10% strengthening in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would have decreased our revenue by $97.2 million and decreased our operating income by $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe most meaningful currency impacts on revenue and operating income are typically attributable to U.S. Dollar exchange rate changes against the Euro and Japanese Yen. Historical exchange rates for these currency pairs are reflected in the charts below:\nInterest Rate Risk. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the interest expense that is generated from our outstanding borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2023, interest income was $19.6 million and interest expense was $47.1 million.\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks. Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates on these holdings could have an $8.6 million impact on our financial results.\nOur outstanding term loan borrowings of $755.0 million as of December 31, 2023 accrue interest at a rate that is based on the Term SOFR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus 0.500%, (ii) the PNC Bank, National Association prime rate, and (iii) Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment for SOFR plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available).\nOn September 29, 2023, the 2022 Credit Agreement was amended to provide for an interest rate adjustment (Sustainability Rate Adjustment) based upon the achievement of certain environmental, social and governance key performance indicators (KPIs). The Sustainability Rate Adjustment range is +/- 0.05% and will go into effect in the first quarter of 2024 based on the 2023 KPIs and will be adjusted annually based on the KPIs of the preceding year.\nBecause interest rates applicable to the outstanding borrowings are variable, we are exposed to interest rate risk from changes in the underlying index rates, which affects our interest expense. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of $7.7 million and a corresponding decrease in cash flows over the next twelve months, based on outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2023.",

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.\nWe believe, based on our knowledge, that the financial statements and other financial information included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this report. We are committed to both a sound internal control environment and to good corporate governance.\nFrom time to time, we review the disclosure controls and procedures and may periodically make changes to enhance their effectiveness and to confirm that our systems evolve with our business.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial records used in preparation of our published financial statements. As all internal control systems have inherent limitations, even systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report is included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Controls. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue-Time-Based Subscription Lease Licenses-Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company sells time-based subscription lease license contracts with customers that are sold as a bundled arrangement that include the rights to a term software license as well as post-contract support (PCS). Revenue is recognized up front at the commencement of the lease for the term software license and recognized ratably over the term of the contract for the PCS in the arrangement. Utilizing observable inputs, the Company determined that 50% of the estimated standalone selling price of the subscription lease license is attributable to the term license, while 50% is attributable to PCS. This determination involved judgment, particularly as it relates to the value relationship between the Company\u2019s PCS to subscription lease licenses, the value relationship between PCS and the Company\u2019s perpetual licenses and its linkage to the shortened term of a subscription lease license, the average economic life of the Company\u2019s software, renewal rates of its customers, and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach.\nGiven the judgments necessary to determine the allocation between the term software license and PCS, auditing this estimate involved a high degree of auditor judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management\u2019s estimate of the allocation between the term software license and PCS in a subscription lease license included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over subscription lease license revenue, including those over the determination of the estimated standalone selling price of the Company\u2019s licenses and services, as well as the allocation of this standalone selling price within the arrangement.\n\u2022We evaluated the pricing relationship between PCS and perpetual licenses on the net licensing fee of the arrangement, as well as the Company\u2019s renewal rate of PCS sales on perpetual licenses through those arrangements selected for testing that contained both elements as a consideration point of the value relationship between the term software license and PCS when a customer purchases a bundled subscription lease license.\n\u2022We evaluated the estimated economic life of the Company\u2019s software through observable data points.\n\u2022Through our current and historical audit procedures, we confirmed that the term software license portion and PCS portion of an arrangement are not sold separately from one another.\n\u2022We selected a sample of arrangements and performed the following:\n-Compared the list price of the subscription lease license to the consideration received from the customer and recalculated the discount from list price for each arrangement.\n-Evaluated whether management appropriately calculated the estimated standalone selling price for the subscription lease license.\n-Tested management\u2019s identification of distinct performance obligations.\n-Tested the mathematical accuracy of revenue recognized at a point in time or over time based upon the identification of subscription lease licenses within the arrangement.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 21, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ANSYS, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of ANSYS, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 21, 2024\nANSYS, INC.

We also have a multi-year product and integration strategy that will result in new, combined products or changes to the historical product offerings. As a result, it is impracticable for us to provide accurate historical or current reporting among our various product lines.\nPending Acquisition\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with Synopsys, Inc. (Synopsys) under which Synopsys will acquire Ansys. Under the terms of the agreement, Ansys stockholders will receive $197.00 in cash and 0.3450 of a share of Synopsys common stock for each Ansys share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $35.0 billion based on the closing price of Synopsys common stock on December 21, 2023. The transaction is anticipated to close in the first half of 2025, subject to approval by Ansys stockholders, the receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. See Note 20 \"Subsequent Event\" for additional details.\n2.Accounting Policies\nAccounting Principles\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain items in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported net income, comprehensive income, cash flows, total assets or total liabilities and stockholders' equity.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nBusiness combinations: In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08). ASU 2021-08 requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if the acquirer had originated the contracts. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2022. Under the prior guidance, such assets and liabilities were recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nAccounting Guidance Issued and Not Yet Adopted\nSegment reporting: In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07). ASU 2023-07 requires enhanced disclosures related to segment information, including for entities with one reportable segment. It does not change the determination of reportable segments. The enhanced disclosures in accordance with the new guidance are required to be reported in the annual period beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The standard only impacts footnote disclosures and will not impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome tax disclosures: In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 requires disclosure of greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The standard only impacts footnote disclosures and will not impact our consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Estimates also affect the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates included in or impacting these consolidated financial statements include:\n\u2022Contract revenue\n\u2022Standalone selling prices of our products and services\n\u2022Allowance for doubtful accounts receivable\n\u2022Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\u2022Useful lives for depreciation and amortization\n\u2022Acquired deferred revenue\n\u2022Operating lease assets and liabilities\n\u2022Fair values of stock awards\n\u2022Income taxes\n\u2022Uncertain tax positions\n\u2022Tax valuation reserves\n\u2022Contingencies and litigation\nActual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in the results of operations in the period that the changes occur.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. We enter into contracts that include combinations of products, maintenance and services, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns.\nRevenue from perpetual licenses is classified as software license revenue. Software license revenue is recognized up front upon delivery of the licensed product and/or the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys, provided that an enforceable contract has been received. Typically, our perpetual licenses are sold with post-contract support (PCS), which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. We allocate value in bundled perpetual and PCS arrangements based on the standalone selling prices of the perpetual license and PCS. Revenue from PCS is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as we satisfy the PCS performance obligation.\nIn addition to perpetual licenses, we sell time-based subscription lease licenses. Subscription lease licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license and PCS. Utilizing observable inputs, we determined that 50% of the estimated standalone selling price of the subscription lease license is attributable to the term license and 50% is attributable to the PCS. This determination considered the value relationship for our products between PCS and time-based subscription lease licenses, the value relationship between PCS and perpetual licenses, the average economic life of our products, software renewal rates and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach. Consistent with the perpetual sales, the license component is classified as software license revenue and recognized as revenue up front at the commencement of the lease upon delivery of the licensed product and/or utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys. The PCS is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as we satisfy the PCS performance obligation.\nRevenue from training, consulting and other services is recognized as the services are performed. For contracts in which the service consists of a single performance obligation, such as providing a training class to a customer, we recognize revenue upon completion of the performance obligation. For service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple performance obligations (for example, both training and consulting), we measure the progress toward completion of the obligations and recognize revenue accordingly. In measuring progress towards the completion of performance obligations, we typically utilize output-based estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials, and estimate output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract. Input-based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials, utilizing direct labor as the input measure.\nWe also execute arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute our software products to end users of our products and services in specified territories. In sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner is the principal to the transaction with the end user. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners in a manner consistent with the direct sales described above for both perpetual and time-based licenses. Revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to us by the channel partners. This amount includes a fee for PCS that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user, which is recognized over the period that PCS is to be provided.\nNon-income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses. The collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses.\nWe do not offer right of return. We warrant to our customers that our software will perform substantially as specified in our current user manuals. We have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support, which we are already obligated to provide. The warranty is not sold, and cannot be purchased, separately.\nThe warranty does not provide any type of additional service to the customer or performance obligation for us.\nOur agreements with our customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third-party patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights. Such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry-standard respects, including our right to replace an infringing product.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer. Judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations, and if so, to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. We use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for each performance obligation. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less. Sales commissions associated with the initial year of multi-year contracts are expensed as incurred due to their immateriality. Sales commissions associated with multi-year contracts beyond the initial year are subject to an employee service requirement and are expensed as incurred as they are not considered incremental costs to obtain a contract.\nWe are required to adjust promised amounts of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of the payments provides the customer or us with a significant financing benefit. We consider various factors in assessing whether a financing component exists, including the duration of the contract, market interest rates and the timing of payments. Our contracts do not include a significant financing component requiring adjustment to the transaction price.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as deposits held at major banks and money market funds. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Our cash and cash equivalents balances comprise the following:\nOur money market fund balances were held in various funds of a single issuer at December 31, 2023.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets, which range from one year to forty years. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses from the sale or retirement of property and equipment are included in operating income.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Internally developed software costs required to be capitalized as defined by the accounting guidance are not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we consummate an acquisition, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized separately from goodwill at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. While best estimates and assumptions are used to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill as we obtain new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. Other intangible assets consist of acquired software and technology, customer lists and trade names. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which range from two years to seventeen years. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $103.5 million, $85.1 million and $76.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount. We have one reporting unit. Goodwill is tested at this reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level. This requires us to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested, including business plans, anticipated future cash flows, economic projections and other market data.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, we completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date, January 1, 2023. No other events or circumstances changed during the year ended December 31, 2023 that would indicate that the fair values of our reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are below their carrying amounts.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nWe have a concentration of credit risk with respect to revenue and trade receivables due to the use of channel partners to market and sell our products. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and generally do not require collateral. The following table outlines concentrations of risk with respect to our revenue:\nNo single customer or channel partner accounted for more than 5% of our revenue in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nIn addition to the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, our cash and cash equivalents are also exposed to concentration risk. Our cash and cash equivalent accounts are insured through various public and private bank deposit insurance programs, foreign and domestic; however, a significant portion of our funds are not insured. The following table outlines concentrations of risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents:\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments requires us to use the current expected credit loss methodology to make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables over the lifetime of the receivables. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are estimated at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages, we consider our historical loss experience, current economic trends and future conditions.\nThe changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value, the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of limitations remains open.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nForeign Currencies\nCertain of our sales and intercompany transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are converted to the functional currency in the period in which they occur. Assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or our subsidiaries' functional currencies are translated at the effective exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in other (expense) income, net. We recorded net foreign exchange losses of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, net foreign exchange gains of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net foreign exchange losses of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from the functional (local) currency to U.S. Dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated at average exchange rates, which approximate rates in effect when the underlying transactions occurred.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss is composed entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (EPS) amounts are computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive equivalents outstanding. To the extent stock awards are anti-dilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\nThe details of basic and diluted EPS are as follows:\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with share-based payment accounting guidance. The guidance requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, typically the vesting period.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance applicable to fair value measurements and disclosures. The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, other accrued liabilities, fixed forward contracts and short-term obligations are deemed to be reasonable estimates of their fair values because of their short-term nature. Our term loans are variable rate debt obligations and, therefore, the carrying amounts approximate the fair values.\n3.Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes revenue:\nOur software licenses revenue is recognized up front, while maintenance and service revenue is recognized over the term of the contract.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from customer agreements. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of billings to customers. Payment terms vary by the type and location of customer and the products or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.\nThe changes in deferred revenue, inclusive of both current and long-term deferred revenue, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nTotal revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2023 will be recognized as revenue as follows:\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes both deferred revenue and backlog. Our backlog represents deferred revenue associated with installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and committed contracts with start dates beyond the end of the current period. Revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included amounts in deferred revenue and backlog at the beginning of the period of $846.3 million, of which $414.0 million was in deferred revenue, and $764.9 million, of which $391.5 million was in deferred revenue, respectively.\n4.Acquisitions\nOn January 3, 2023, we completed the acquisition of DYNAmore for a purchase price of $139.2 million, or $126.4 million net of cash acquired. The acquisition expands our position as a simulation solution provider within the automotive industry. The effects of the acquisition were not material to our consolidated results of operations.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed other acquisitions to expand our solution offerings and enhance our customers' experience. These acquisitions were not significant, individually or in the aggregate. The combined purchase price of these acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $94.4 million, or $88.3 million net of cash acquired.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred acquisition-related expenses of $9.4 million. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized as selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses on the consolidated statements of income.\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisitions have been recorded based upon management's estimates of their fair market values as of each respective date of acquisition. The following tables summarize the fair value of consideration and the fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at each respective date of acquisition:\nFair Value of Consideration:\nThe goodwill, which is generally not tax-deductible, is attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the assembled workforces of the acquired businesses and the synergies expected to arise as a result of the acquisitions.\nThe fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on preliminary calculations. The estimates and assumptions for these items are subject to change as additional information about what was known and knowable at each respective acquisition date is obtained during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).\nWe determined the fair value of our intangible assets using various valuation techniques, including the relief-from-royalty method and the multi-period excess earnings method. These models utilize certain unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: selection of a valuation methodology, royalty rate, discount rate, attrition rate and obsolescence rate.\nThe weighted-average useful life, valuation method and assumptions used to determine the fair value of the intangible assets related to the 2023 acquisitions are as follows:\nThe operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since each respective date of acquisition. The effects of the business combinations were not material to our consolidated results of operations individually or in the aggregate during 2023.\n2022 Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed several strategic acquisitions to enhance our customers' experience. The effects of the acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations individually or in the aggregate. The combined purchase price of the acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $401.7 million, or $390.8 million net of cash acquired.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred acquisition-related expenses of $10.3 million. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized as selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses on the consolidated statements of income.\nThe assets and liabilities of the acquisitions have been recorded based upon management's estimates of their fair market values as of each respective date of acquisition. The following tables summarize the fair values of consideration transferred and the fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at each respective date of acquisition:\nThe goodwill, which is generally not tax-deductible, is attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the assembled workforces of the acquired businesses and the synergies expected to arise as a result of the acquisitions.\nThe weighted-average useful life, valuation method and assumptions used to determine the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in 2022 are as follows:\nThe operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since each respective date of acquisition. The effects of the business combinations were not material to our consolidated results of operations individually or in the aggregate during 2022.\n5.Other Receivables and Current Assets and Other Accrued Expenses and Liabilities\nOur other receivables and current assets, and other accrued expenses and liabilities, comprise the following balances:\nReceivables related to unrecognized revenue represent the current portion of billings made for customer contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue.\n6.Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consists of the following:\nDepreciation expense related to property and equipment was $29.0 million, $29.5 million and $30.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n7.Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based on their fair values on the date of acquisition.\nIntangible assets are classified as follows:\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of two years to seventeen years.\nAs of December 31, 2023, estimated future amortization expense for the intangible assets reflected above is as follows:\nThe changes in goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n(1) In addition to goodwill from acquisitions completed within the period, in accordance with the accounting for business combinations, we recorded adjustments to goodwill for the effect of changes in the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as we obtained new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Such adjustments are not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, we completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date, January 1, 2023. No other events or circumstances changed during the year ended December 31, 2023 that would indicate that the fair values of our reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are below their carrying amounts.\n8.Fair Value Measurement\nThe valuation hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities reported at fair value prioritizes the inputs for such valuations into three broad levels:\n\u2022Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u2022Level 2: quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; or\n\u2022Level 3: unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.\nA financial asset's or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nOur debt is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because these borrowings are not actively traded and have a variable interest rate structure based upon market rates. The carrying amount of our debt approximates the estimated fair value. See Note 10, \"Debt\", for additional information on these borrowings.\nThe following tables provide the assets carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis:\nThe cash equivalents in the preceding tables represent money market funds, valued at net asset value, with carrying values which approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature.\nThe short-term investments in the preceding tables represent deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries. The deposits have fixed interest rates with original maturities ranging from three months to one year.\nThe deferred compensation plan investments in the preceding tables represent trading securities held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of non-employee directors. These securities consist of mutual funds traded in an active market with quoted prices. As a result, the plan assets are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The plan assets are recorded within other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe equity securities represent our investment in a publicly traded company. These securities are traded in an active market with quoted prices. As a result, the securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The securities are recorded within other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe forward contracts represent currency hedges to mitigate exchange rate exposure. These contracts are classified within Level 2 because these contracts are not actively traded and the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. The liabilities associated with the forward contracts are recorded at fair value in other accrued expenses and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n9.Leases\nOur right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities primarily include operating leases for office space. Our executive offices and those related to certain domestic product development, marketing, production and administration are located in a 186,000 square foot office facility in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. The term of the lease is 183 months, which began on October 1, 2014 and expires on December 31, 2029. The lease agreement includes options to renew the contract through August 2044, an option to lease additional space in January 2025 and an option to terminate the lease in December 2025. No options are included in the lease liability. Absent the exercise of options in the lease, our remaining base rent (inclusive of property taxes and certain operating costs) is $4.5 million per annum through 2024 and $4.7 million per annum for 2025 - 2029.\nThe components of our global lease cost reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n(1) Variable lease cost includes common area maintenance, property taxes, utilities and fluctuations in rent due to a change in an index or rate.\nOther information related to operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nThe maturity schedule of the operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 is as follows:\n(1)Includes the current portion of operating lease liabilities of $23.3 million, which is reflected in other accrued expenses and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThere were no material leases that have been signed but not yet commenced as of December 31, 2023.\n10.Debt\nOn June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the 2022 Credit Agreement) with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swing line lender, and an L/C issuer, the lenders party thereto, and the other L/C issuers party thereto. The 2022 Credit Agreement refinanced our previous credit agreements in their entirety. Terms used in this description of the 2022 Credit Agreement with initial capital letters that are not otherwise defined herein are as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement.\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement provides for a $755.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a $500.0 million unsecured revolving loan facility, which includes a $50.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The revolving loan facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes. Each of the term loan facility and the revolving loan facility matures on June 30, 2027.\nBorrowings under the term loan and revolving loan facilities accrue interest at a rate that is based on the Term SOFR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus 0.500%, (ii) the PNC Bank, National Association prime rate, and (iii) Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment for SOFR plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available).\nOn September 29, 2023, the 2022 Credit Agreement was amended to provide for an interest rate adjustment (Sustainability Rate Adjustment) based upon the achievement of certain environmental, social and governance key performance indicators (KPIs). The Sustainability Rate Adjustment range is +/- 0.05% and will go into effect in the first quarter of 2024 based on the 2023 KPIs and will be adjusted annually based on the KPIs of the preceding year.\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement also provides for the option to add certain foreign subsidiaries as borrowers and to borrow in Euros, Sterling, Yen and Swiss Francs under the revolving loan facility, up to a sublimit of $150.0 million. Borrowings under the revolving loan facility denominated in these currencies will accrue interest at a rate that is based on (a) for Euros, \u20acSTR, (b) for Sterling, SONIA, (c) for Yen, TONAR and (d) for Swiss Francs, SARON, plus an applicable margin calculated as described above.\nUnder the 2022 Credit Agreement, the weighted average interest rate in effect for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 6.01%. Under the 2022 Credit Agreement and prior credit agreements, the weighted average interest rate in effect for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2.72%. The rate in effect as of December 31, 2023 and for the first quarter of 2024 under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 6.32%.\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The 2022 Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring us and our subsidiaries to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio not in excess of 3.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter (for the four-quarter period ending on such date) with an opportunity for a temporary increase in such consolidated net leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 upon the consummation of certain qualified acquisitions for which the aggregate consideration is at least $250.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $755.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan, with a carrying value of $753.9 million, which is net of $1.1 million of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs. The total amount was included in long-term debt. As of December 31, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving loan facility.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $755.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan, with a carrying value of $753.6 million, which is net of $1.4 million of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs. The total amount was included in long-term debt. As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving loan facility.\nWe were in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, all debt is scheduled to mature in 2027 with no principal payments required prior to the maturity date.\n11.Income Taxes\nIncome before income tax provision included the following components:\nThe provision for income taxes was composed of the following:\nThe reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the consolidated effective tax rate was as follows:\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nThe net increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to $0.5 million of currency fluctuations on balances relating to foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in unrealizable tax assets. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect the future realization of deferred tax assets. If management determines it is more likely than not that an asset, or a portion of an asset, will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $7.2 million, which are subject to limitations of their utilization. Losses totaling $6.5 million are not currently subject to expiration dates, while the remaining $0.7 million of losses expire between 2028 - 2037. Deferred tax assets of $2.3 million have been recorded for state operating loss carryforwards. These losses expire between 2031 - 2042, and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $128.3 million, of which $88.7 million are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder, $39.6 million, expires between 2025 - 2038. We had tax credit carryforwards of $7.5 million, of which $0.5 million are not currently subject to expiration dates and $7.0 million expire in various years between 2025 - 2043. Of these tax credit carryforwards, $0.9 million are subject to limitations on their utilization.\nIn general, it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts. Substantially all of the pre-2018 earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and post-2018 current earnings are taxed as part of global intangible low-taxed income tax expense. These taxes increase our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual U.S. federal tax. Unrecognized provisions for taxes on indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries would not be significant.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:\nWe believe that it is reasonably possible that $3.2 million of uncertain tax positions included in the table above may be resolved within the next twelve months as a result of settlement with a taxing authority or a lapse of the statute of limitations. If the unrecognized tax benefit as of December 31, 2023 were to be recognized, a benefit of $13.5 million would impact the effective tax rate.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense. We recorded penalty expense of $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recorded interest income of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, interest expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and interest income of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2023, we accrued a liability for penalties of $8.7 million and interest of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2022, we accrued a liability for penalties of $7.9 million and interest of $3.0 million.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, our only major tax jurisdiction, the 2017 - 2023 tax years are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\n12.Pension and Profit-Sharing Plans\nWe have a 401(k) plan for all qualifying domestic employees that permits participants to defer a portion of their pay pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. We make matching contributions on behalf of each eligible participant in an amount equal to 100% of the first 3% and an additional 25% of the next 5%, for a maximum total of 4.25% of the employee's eligible compensation. We may make discretionary matching contributions. We may also make discretionary nonelective contributions in an amount to be determined by the Board of Directors for each plan year, provided the employee is employed at the end of the year and has worked at least 1,000 hours. Domestic employees of acquired businesses may participate in the 401(k) plan when they become eligible. We also maintain and contribute to various defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements for our international employees. We meet the minimum statutory funding requirements for our foreign plans. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total unfunded portions of the benefit obligations were $11.8 million and $9.4 million, respectively.\nExpenses related to our retirement programs were $25.9 million in 2023, $21.9 million in 2022 and $20.0 million in 2021.\n13.Non-Compete and Employment Agreements\nOur employees have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information that, where legally permitted, restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with us anywhere in the world while employed by us (and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter in relevant geographic areas), and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are our property. In addition, we require all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe have an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer. Under the terms of the employment agreement, in the event that the Chief Executive Officer's employment with us is terminated by us without \"Cause\" or as a result of his resignation with \"Good Reason,\" (each as defined in the agreement) the Chief Executive Officer will be entitled to (i) receive an amount equal to two times the sum of his then effective base salary plus his target bonus, payable over 24 months in equal installments, (ii) receive payment of the prior year's earned annual cash incentive, to the extent unpaid, (iii) receive payment of a pro-rated target annual cash incentive for the year of termination, (iv) in certain circumstances, receive a lump sum amount equal to 24 months of the COBRA premium applicable to the health, dental and vision plans in which the Chief Executive Officer was participating prior to termination, (v) have any outstanding performance-based and time-based equity awards receive accelerated vesting treatment equal to an additional two years after termination, and (vi) have the period of time during which the Chief Executive Officer may exercise his vested stock options be extended to the longer of (x) six months after his date of termination or (y) seven days after the commencement of our first open trading window that occurs after the date of termination, but in no event later than the 10-year expiration date of such options. During his employment with us and for two years thereafter, following termination of employment under certain circumstances described in the contract, he will be subject to non-competition and non-solicitation obligations.\nIf a termination under the circumstances described above occurs during the period beginning 60 days prior to the effective date of a definitive agreement that will result in a change in control and ending 18 months after the consummation (closing) of a change in control, then, in lieu of the benefits described in the foregoing paragraph, the Chief Executive Officer will be entitled to the amounts described in the paragraph above, except that (a) the amount described in clause (i) will be paid in a lump sum rather than over 24 months, and (b) instead of the two-year acceleration period described in clause (v), all outstanding performance-based and time-based equity awards held by the Chief Executive Officer shall immediately become fully exercisable, vested and/or non-forfeitable on an accelerated basis, subject to any performance or metric-based requirements set forth therein which shall be separately determined as set forth in the applicable award agreement.\nWe also have employment agreements with several other employees, primarily in foreign jurisdictions. The terms of these employment agreements generally include annual compensation and non-compete clauses.\n14.Stock-Based Compensation\nOn May 14, 2021, our stockholders approved the ANSYS, Inc. 2021 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2021 Plan). The 2021 Plan is a long-term incentive plan pursuant to which awards may be granted to directors, officers, other employees and certain consultants of Ansys and its subsidiaries. These awards include stock option rights, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, cash incentives, performance shares, performance units and other awards. The 2021 Plan authorizes 4.4 million shares of common stock for issuance, plus 1.6 million shares that remained available for issuance under the Fifth Amended and Restated ANSYS, Inc. 1996 Stock Option and Grant Plan (the Predecessor Plan) as of the effective date of the 2021 Plan plus any shares relating to the outstanding awards under the Predecessor Plan or the 2021 Plan that are subsequently forfeited. As of the effective date of the 2021 Plan, grants were no longer made under the Predecessor Plan.\nThe 2021 Plan requires a minimum vesting period or performance period of one year for most award types and a maximum period for options to be exercisable as ten years from the grant date. Upon the death or disability of a participant, performance awards are vested pro-rata, subject to any performance target requirements, and all other awards become fully vested. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may, at its sole discretion, accelerate the date or dates on which an award granted under the 2021 Plan may vest in the event of a change in control or an employee's termination of employment. A change in control will result in awards either being assumed by the acquirer or the pre-existing awards becoming immediately vested and earned at target award levels. In the event an employee is terminated without cause within 18 months after the change in control, any assumed awards will become immediately vested.\nWe currently issue shares related to exercised stock options or vested awards from our existing pool of treasury shares and have no specific policy to repurchase treasury shares as stock options are exercised or as awards vest. If the treasury pool is depleted, we will issue new shares.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to awards granted prior to that date was $306.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. Forfeitures of awards are accounted for as they occur.\nStock Options\nPrior to 2017, we granted stock option awards. The value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant, or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (Black-Scholes model). The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards using an option pricing model was affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables included our stock volatility during the preceding six years, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, interest rate assumptions using the five-year U.S. Treasury Note yield on the date of grant or acquisition date and expected dividends. The stock-based compensation expense for options was recorded ratably over the requisite service period.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there is no unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to unvested stock options.\nInformation regarding stock option transactions is summarized below:\nInformation regarding stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2023 is summarized below:\nThere were no unvested stock options as of December 31, 2023.\nRestricted Stock Units\nUnder the terms of the 2021 Plan, we have issued various restricted stock unit awards (RSUs). The following table summarizes the types of awards and vesting conditions:\nThe fair value of RSUs with only a service condition is based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of the grant and is recognized straight-line over the vesting period.\nThe fair value of RSUs with operating performance metrics is based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of the grant and is recognized from the grant date through the vesting period based on management's estimates concerning the probability of operating performance metric achievement.\nThe fair values of RSUs with a market condition were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model and are recognized over the vesting period. The determination of the fair values of the awards was affected by the grant date and several variables, each of which has been identified in the chart below:\nTotal compensation expense for RSU awards recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $213.5 million, $164.0 million and $162.3 million, respectively.\nInformation regarding all employee and non-employee director RSU transactions is summarized below:\n(1) Includes all RSUs granted during the year. RSUs with operating performance conditions are issued annually and have one performance cycle or three sub-performance cycles. Performance conditions are assigned near the beginning of each performance cycle or sub-performance cycle, as applicable, and awards are reflected as grants at the target number of units at that time.\n(2) RSUs with a market or performance condition are granted at target and vest based on achievement of the market or operating performance and service conditions. The actual number of RSUs issued may be more or less than the target RSUs depending on the achievement of the market or operating performance conditions.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn May 12, 2022, our stockholders approved the ANSYS, Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2022 ESPP) and the reservation by our Board of Directors of 750,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2022 ESPP. On October 27, 2022 our Board of Directors approved the amendment and restatement of the 2022 ESPP. The 2022 ESPP replaced the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (1996 Plan) in its entirety. Shares issued in 2023 were issued under the 2022 ESPP. The 2022 ESPP and 1996 Plan (Purchase Plans) allow our employees and employees of our designated subsidiaries to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount to fair market value. There were 671,653 shares available for future purchases as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Purchase Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee. Offerings under the Purchase Plans commence on the first business day occurring on or before each February 1 and August 1, and end on the last business day occurring on or before the following July 31 and January 31, respectively. An employee who owns or is deemed to own shares of stock representing in excess of 5% of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock may not participate in the Purchase Plans.\nDuring each offering, an eligible employee may purchase shares by authorizing payroll deductions of up to 10% of his or her cash compensation during the offering period. The maximum number of shares that may be purchased by any participating employee during any offering period is limited to 3,840 shares. Subject to limitations within the Purchase Plans, each employee's accumulated payroll deductions will be used to purchase common stock on the last day of the applicable offering period at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of the applicable offering period, whichever is less. Under applicable tax rules, an employee may not accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 of the fair market value of our stock (determined on the option grant date or dates) for each calendar year in which the option to purchase shares is outstanding at any time. As of December 31, 2023, 78,347 shares of common stock had been issued under the 2022 ESPP. The total compensation expense recorded under the Purchase Plans during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $8.3 million, $4.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\n15.Stock Repurchase Program\nUnder our stock repurchase program, we repurchased shares as follows:\nAll of the shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2023 were repurchased during the first quarter. As of December 31, 2023, 1.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program. Average price paid per share excludes excise tax. As of January 1, 2023, our share repurchases in excess of issuances are subject to a 1% excise tax enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act. As of December 31, 2023, we had $0.1 million of accrued excise tax. Any excise tax incurred is recognized and reflected as part of the cost basis of the shares acquired in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.\n16.Royalty Agreements\nWe have entered into various renewable license agreements under which we have been granted access to the licensor's technology and the right to sell the technology in our product line. Royalties are payable to developers of the software at various rates and amounts, which generally are based upon unit sales, revenue or flat fees. Royalty fees are reported in cost of software licenses and were $39.0 million, $32.0 million and $36.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n17.Geographic Information\nRevenue to external customers is attributed to individual countries based upon the location of the customer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows:\nProperty and equipment by geographic area was as follows:\n18.Unconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe have entered into various unconditional purchase obligations which primarily include minimum royalty contracts, software licenses and support, and network services. We expended $54.8 million, $54.8 million and $44.9 million related to unconditional purchase obligations that existed as of the beginning of each year for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Future expenditures under unconditional purchase obligations in effect as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\n19.Contingencies and Commitments\nWe are subject to various claims, investigations, and legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits, alleged infringement of third parties' intellectual property rights and other matters. In our opinion, the resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could materially affect our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nOur Indian subsidiary has several service tax audits pending that have resulted in formal inquiries being received on transactions through mid-2012. We could incur tax charges and related liabilities of $7.1 million. As such charges are not probable at this time, a reserve has not been recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. The service tax issues raised in our notices and inquiries are very similar to the case, M/s Microsoft Corporation (I) (P) Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Service Tax, New Delhi, wherein the Delhi Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) issued a favorable ruling to Microsoft. The Microsoft ruling was subsequently challenged in the Supreme Court of India by the Indian tax authority and a decision is still pending. We can provide no assurances on the impact that the Microsoft case's decision will have on our cases, however, an unfavorable ruling in the Microsoft case may impact our assessment of probability and result in the recording of a $7.1 million reserve. We are uncertain as to when these service tax matters will be concluded.\nWe sell software licenses and services to our customers under contractual agreements. Such agreements generally include certain provisions indemnifying the customer against claims, by third parties, of infringement or misappropriation of their intellectual property rights arising from such customer\u2019s usage of our products or services. To date, payments related to these indemnification provisions have been immaterial. For several reasons, including the lack of prior material indemnification claims, we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions.\n20.Subsequent Event\nSynopsys Merger Agreement\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Synopsys and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Ansys, with Ansys surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys. Our Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement, resolved to recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is consummated, our common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) 0.3450 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Synopsys and (ii) $197.00 in cash, without interest, subject to applicable withholding taxes. With regard to the Stock Consideration, if the aggregate number of shares of Synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger would exceed the Maximum Share Number, (a) the Exchange Ratio will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary such that the aggregate number of shares of Synopsys common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger does not exceed the Maximum Share Number and (b) the Per Share Cash Amount will be correspondingly increased to offset such adjustment.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by each of Ansys, Synopsys, and Merger Sub, including, among others, covenants regarding the conduct of our and Synopsys\u2019 businesses during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the making of certain public disclosures and other matters as described in the Merger Agreement. We and Synopsys have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to consummate the Merger, including cooperating to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to complete the Merger. We have agreed not to, among other things, (a) solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions or (b) enter into discussions or negotiations or provide non-public information in connection with any proposal for an alternative transaction from a third party, subject to certain exceptions to permit our Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations. We have further agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with regard to alternative transactions.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including that either party may have the right to terminate if the Merger is not completed by January 15, 2025, which may be extended to January 15, 2026 as provided in the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, (A) Synopsys, under specified circumstances, including termination following an injunction arising in connection with certain antitrust or foreign investment laws, will be required to pay us a termination fee of $1,500.0 million; and (B) we, under specified circumstances, including our termination of the Merger Agreement to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or Synopsys' termination upon the change by our Board of Directors of its recommendation in favor of the Merger, will be required to pay Synopsys a termination fee of $950.0 million.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, approval of the Merger under certain applicable antitrust and foreign investment regimes and the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders. We anticipate the transaction to close in the first half of 2025.\nEXHIBIT INDEX\nExhibit No. Exhibit\n2.1 Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 15, 2024, by and among Synopsys, Inc., ANSYS, Inc. and ALTA Acquisition Corp.
