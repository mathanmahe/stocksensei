    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nOverview and Description of Major Subsidiaries\nAEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925. It is a public utility holding company that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries.\nThe service areas of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served. The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service, consisting of generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their retail customers. Restructuring laws in Michigan, Ohio and the ERCOT area of Texas have caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers.\nThe member companies of AEP have contractual, financial and other business relationships with the other member companies, such as participation in AEP savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of electricity and transportation and handling of fuel. The member companies of AEP also obtain certain accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering, financial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider, AEPSC.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 17,250 employees. Because it is a holding company rather than an operating company, AEP has no employees.\nInformation related to AEP subsidiary operating companies as of December 31, 2023 is shown in the table below:\n(a)KGPCo does not own any generating facilities and purchases electric power from APCo for distribution to its customers.\n(b)OPCo purchases energy and capacity at auction to serve generation service customers who have not switched to a competitive generation supplier.\n(c)AEPTCo is a holding company for the State Transcos. Five State Transcos are members of PJM and two State Transcos are members of SPP. Neither AEPTCo nor its subsidiaries have any employees. Instead, AEPSC and certain AEP utility subsidiaries provide services to these entities.\nService Company Subsidiary\nAEPSC is a service company subsidiary that provides accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering, financial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost to AEP subsidiaries. The executive officers of AEP and certain of the executive officers of its public utility subsidiaries are employees of AEPSC. As of December 31, 2023, AEPSC had 6,736 employees.\nPrincipal Industries Served\nThe following table illustrates the principal industries and wholesale electric markets served by AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries.\n(a)Primarily includes data centers and cryptocurrency operations.\nPublic Utility Subsidiaries by Jurisdiction\nThe following table illustrates certain regulatory information with respect to the jurisdictions in which the public utility subsidiaries of AEP operate:\n(a)Identifies the predominant current authorized ROE, and may not include other, less significant, permitted recovery. Actual ROE varies from authorized ROE.\n(b)In December 2022, the FERC issued an order removing the 50 basis point RTO incentive from OHTCo transmission formula rates effective February 2022, reducing OHTCo\u2019s authorized ROE to 9.85%.\n(c)The KPSC issued an order approving a 9.75% ROE, effective January 2024. See \u201c2023 Kentucky Base Rate and Securitization Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\n(d)In February 2022, as part of the 2020 Texas Base Rate Case, SWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT alleging several errors in the final order, which included a challenge of the approved ROE. In April 2022, the PUCT denied the motion for rehearing. In May 2022, SWEPCo filed a petition for review with the Texas District Court seeking a judicial review of the several errors challenged in the PUCT\u2019s final order. See \u201c2020 Texas Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\nCLASSES OF SERVICE\nAEP and subsidiaries recognize revenues from customers for retail and wholesale electricity sales and electricity transmission and distribution delivery services. AEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities, Transmission and Distribution Utilities, AEP Transmission Holdco and Generation & Marketing segments derive revenue from the following sources: Retail Revenues, Wholesale and Competitive Retail Revenues, Other Revenues from Contracts with Customers and Alternative Revenues. For further information relating to the sources of revenue for the Registrants, see Note 19 - Revenues from Contracts with Customers for additional information.\nFINANCING\nGeneral\nAEP subsidiaries generally use short-term debt to finance working capital needs. Short-term debt may also be used to finance acquisitions, construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with long-term debt. In recent history, short-term funding needs have been provided for by cash from operations, AEP\u2019s commercial paper program and term loan issuances. Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program. Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity. See \u201cFinancial Condition\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nAEP\u2019s revolving credit agreements (which backstop the commercial paper program) include covenants and events of default typical for these types of facilities, including a maximum debt/capital test. In addition, the acceleration of AEP\u2019s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2023, AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants. With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the applicable agreement. A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event. See \u201cFinancial Condition\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional financing arrangements, such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements.\nENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS\nGeneral\nAEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with regard to air and water-quality control, solid and hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities. The current and proposed environmental laws and regulations discussed below will have an impact on AEP\u2019s operations. Management continues to monitor developments in these regulations and evaluate the economic feasibility and refine cost estimates for compliance. For additional information on the laws and regulations discussed below, see \u201cEnvironmental Issues\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report.\nClean Air Act Requirements (CAA)\nThe CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation\u2019s air quality and control sources of air emissions. The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements. The primary regulatory programs that continue to drive investments in AEP\u2019s existing generating units include: (a) periodic revisions to NAAQS and the development of SIPs to achieve more stringent standards, (b) implementation of the regional haze program by the states and the Federal EPA, (c) regulation of hazardous air pollutant emissions under MATS, (d) implementation and review of CSAPR and (e) the Federal EPA\u2019s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil generation under Section 111 of the CAA.\nClean Water Act Requirements\nThe Federal EPA\u2019s ELG rule for generation facilities establishes limits for FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater, which are implemented through each facility\u2019s wastewater discharge permit. In March 2023, the Federal EPA proposed further revisions to the ELG rule which, if finalized, would establish a zero discharge standard for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water, and more stringent discharge limits for combustion residual leachate. Management cannot predict whether the Federal EPA will actually finalize further revisions but will continue to monitor this issue and its potential impact to operations.\nCoal Ash Regulation\nThe Federal EPA\u2019s CCR rule regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of CCR, including fly ash and bottom ash created from coal-fired generating units and FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants. The rule applies to active and inactive CCR landfills and surface impoundments at facilities of active electric utility or independent power producers. In May 2023, the Federal EPA proposed revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at inactive facilities (\u201clegacy CCR surface impoundments\u201d) as well as to establish requirements for currently exempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land (\u201cCCR management units\u201d). The Federal EPA is proposing that owners and operators of legacy surface impoundments comply with all of the existing CCR Rule requirements applicable to inactive CCR surface impoundments at active facilities, except for the location restrictions and liner design criteria. The proposal establishes accelerated compliance deadlines for legacy surface impoundments to meet regulatory requirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within one year after the effective date of the final rule. The Federal EPA's proposal would require evaluations to be completed at both active facilities and inactive facilities with one or more legacy surface impoundments. If finalized, AEP may incur material, additional costs complying with the Federal EPA\u2019s proposal, including costs to upgrade or close and replace legacy CCR surface impoundments and to conduct any required remedial actions including removal of coal ash. In addition, AEP would need to seek cost recovery through regulated rates, including proposing new regulatory mechanisms for cost recovery, for which regulatory approval cannot be assured. The proposed rule, if finalized, could have a material adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition if AEP cannot ultimately recover any additional costs of compliance.\nClimate Change, CO2 Regulation and Energy Policy\nTo date, the Federal EPA has twice taken action to regulate CO2 emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the CAA and both attempts have been struck down by the courts. In May 2023, the Federal EPA proposed greenhouse gas standards and guidelines for new and existing fossil-fuel fired sources. The proposal relies heavily on carbon capture and sequestration and natural gas co-firing as means to reduce CO2 emissions from coal fired plants and hydrogen co-firing and carbon capture and sequestration to reduce CO2 emissions from gas turbines. Management is evaluating the proposed rule.\nOther Environmental Issues and Matters\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites, as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites. See \u201cThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation\u201d section of Note 6 included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nElectric Industry Transformation\nThe electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation, driven by changing customer needs, evolving public policies, stakeholder demands, demographics, competitive offerings, technologies and commodity prices. AEP is also transforming to be more agile and customer-focused as a valued provider of energy solutions. AEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs take into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The objective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers. Based on the results of the IRPs, management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units. The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP\u2019s generating capacity included owned and PPA capacity of approximately 23,300 MWs and 5,200 MWs, respectively. In 2023, owned and PPA coal capacity represented 42% of AEP\u2019s generating capacity compared with 70% in 2005.\nThe graph below summarizes AEP\u2019s generating capacity by resource type for the years 1999, 2005 and 2023:\n(a) Energy Efficiency/Demand Response represents avoided capacity rather than physical assets.\nIn addition, certain states AEP subsidiaries serve have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency, alternative energy or renewable energy sources. Management actively monitors AEP\u2019s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP\u2019s regulated utilities had long-term contracts for 2,750 MWs of wind, 80 MWs of hydro and 65 MWs of solar power. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, AEP\u2019s regulated utilities own and operate 1,639 MWs of wind, 816 MWs of hydro and 41 MWs of solar power.\nEnd Use Energy Efficiency\nBeginning in 2008, AEP ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs. These programs, commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management, were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available. Since that time, AEP operating company programs have reduced annual consumption by over 10.5 million MWhs and peak demand by approximately 3,600 MWs. Management estimates that its operating companies spent approximately $1.7 billion since 2008 to achieve these levels.\nEnergy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves, and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings. Appropriate recovery of program costs, lost revenues, and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments. As AEP continues to transition to a cleaner, more efficient energy future, energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers.\nManagement believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions AEP to be a cost-effective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans.\nCorporate Governance\nIn response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEP\u2019s strategic plan, the Board of Directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could alter the retirement date of coal-fired generation assets. The Board of Directors is informed of new environmental regulations and proposed environmental regulations or legislation that would significantly affect AEP. In addition, the Board holds extended meetings twice a year to provide extra time for a more robust review of the Company\u2019s strategy, including discussions about carbon and carbon risk. The Board\u2019s Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees AEP\u2019s annual Corporate Sustainability Report, which includes information about AEP\u2019s environmental, social, governance and financial performance. In 2023, AEP also established a Climate Change Executive Group to ensure appropriate management and accountability concerning climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities.\nAEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs take into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The objective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers. Based on the output of the company\u2019s IRPs, in October 2022, AEP announced new intermediate and long-term CO2 emission reduction goals. AEP adjusted its near-term CO2 emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005 baseline, upgraded its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full Scope 1 emissions and accelerated its net-zero goal by five years to 2045 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. AEP\u2019s total Scope 1 GHG estimated emissions in 2023 were approximately 42.8 million metric tons, a 68% reduction according to the GHG Protocol, which excludes emission reductions that result from assets that have been sold, or a 72% reduction from AEP\u2019s 2005 Scope 1 GHG emissions (inclusive of emission reductions that result from plants that have been sold).\nAEP has made significant progress in reducing CO2 emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline over the long-term. AEP also expects Scope 1 GHG emissions to vary annually depending on the mix of its own generation and purchased power used to serve customers. AEP\u2019s ability to achieve these goals is dependent upon a number of factors including the ability to execute on renewable resource plans, evolving RTO requirements, constructive regulatory support, the advancement of carbon-free generation technologies, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential tariffs, carbon policy and regulation, operational performance of renewable generation and supply chain costs and constraints, all while continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nAttracting, developing and retaining high-performing employees with the skills and experience needed to serve our customers efficiently and effectively is crucial to AEP\u2019s growth and competitiveness and is central to our long-term strategy. AEP invests in employees and continues to build a high performance and inclusive culture that inspires leadership, encourages innovative thinking and welcomes everyone.\nThe following table shows AEP\u2019s number of employees by subsidiary as of December 31, 2023:\nOf AEP\u2019s 17,250 employees, less than 0.1% are Traditionalists (born before 1946), approximately 17% are Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964), approximately 36% are Generation X (born 1965-1980), approximately 39% are Millennials (born 1981-1996) and approximately 7% are Generation Z (born after 1996).\nSafety\nSafety is deeply embedded in our culture and is one of AEP\u2019s core values because we care that everyone goes home at the end of each work day. We have policies, procedures, programs, training and proactive initiatives in place to help ensure a safe mindset and work environment. Unfortunately, in 2023, we suffered three devastating losses as two employees and one contractor lost their lives. The loss of a single life is unacceptable and we are determined to learn from each event, independently, so we can take action to better protect our employees and all those who support us. These events reinforce the importance of our endless commitment to a strong safety culture and the work it takes to operate safely. We are committed to taking bold steps to fundamentally embed layers of protection in the work we do. This includes focusing our efforts to prevent serious injuries and fatalities, strengthening pre-job briefing effectiveness, learning from significant incidents, providing appropriate training and education and improving proactive safety initiatives and data analysis to identify and address potential performance gaps. One common industry safety metric utilized by AEP to track incidents is the Days Away/Restricted or Transferred (DART) rate. A DART event is an event that results in one or more lost days, one or more restricted days, or results in an employee transferring to a different job within the company. The DART rate is a mathematical calculation (number of DART events multiplied by 200,000 and divided by total YTD hours worked) that describes the number of injuries per 100 full-time employees. In 2023, AEP\u2019s employee DART rate performance improved to 0.384 as compared to 0.424 in 2022.\nCulture and Inclusion\nCulture serves as the foundation for success at AEP. An engaged, collaborative, inclusive and appreciated workforce is an empowered workforce - one that is more likely to embrace change, drive continuous improvement, take ownership, and value personal and professional growth. AEP views a culture of inclusion as a core business value that creates understanding, sparks innovation and allows us to better serve our customers. We are committed to building a work culture that champions respect and belonging, that leverages our differences as a strength. Inclusion is important to ensuring that AEP has the best talent to move our company forward and achieve business objectives. Our inclusion efforts are guided by four principles:\n\u2022Establishing leadership accountability around culture and inclusion outcomes.\n\u2022Building and maintaining a workforce that generally reflects the communities we serve.\n\u2022Promoting an inclusive culture where all employees can thrive.\n\u2022Supporting the communities we serve so they will prosper.\nWe believe our workforce generally should re\ufb02ect the diversity of our customers and the communities we serve so that we may better understand how to tailor our services to meet their expectations. As of December 31, 2023, women comprised approximately 20% of AEP\u2019s total workforce. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 21% of AEP\u2019s total workforce was represented by racially or ethnically diverse employees.\nOur progress is tied to enterprise, business unit and operating company annual incentive compensation objectives, which is measured through our annual employee culture survey. 2023 marks our tenth consecutive year of formally surveying employees about their experiences with culture at AEP. In 2023, 94% of our organization participated in the survey, and we continued to improve our performance remaining in the top decile compared to Gallup\u2019s overall company database. The culture survey provides a process for leaders to share results with their teams, facilitate discussions to improve employee engagement and take actions toward that improvement throughout the year. AEP\u2019s Human Resources Committee of the Board reviews the culture and employee engagement results annually, providing additional oversight. In addition, the Human Resources Committee of the Board provides oversight of our compensation and human resources policies and practices, including an annual review of our culture and inclusion strategy, and compliance with equal opportunity laws. In 2023, AEP received the Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award for the fourth consecutive year. This award recognizes organizations with engaged workplace cultures.\nTo support a culture of inclusion, AEP launched the Culture and Inclusion Council, which consists of decision makers from across the company to help lead our culture strategy. A key focus for the council will be prioritizing our Culture & Inclusion guiding principles. In addition, AEP launched the Access to Opportunity standards to enhance female and minority representation within AEP\u2019s leadership and conducted pay equity studies to identify and address pay variances for female and minority employees. We are also signatories of the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge, Paradigm for Parity and several other local and industry initiatives to demonstrate our commitment to advancing a culture of inclusion within the workplace.\nIn addition, we\u2019re committed to working with the communities we serve to advance equity for our employees, customers and neighbors of color. The American Electric Power Foundation created the Delivering on the Dream grant program. This five-year, $5 million initial investment supports nonprofit organizations that are working to dismantle systemic racism and injustices in our communities.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nOne of the best ways for AEP to demonstrate our commitment to a trusting and inclusive work environment is to empower employees to form and participate in Employee Resource Groups (ERG). The ERGs at AEP include Abled and Differently-Abled Partnering Together, the Black ERG, the Asian-American Employee Partnership ERG, the Hispanic Origin Latin American ERG, the Military Veteran ERG, the Native American Tribes Interacting, Observing and Networking ERG, the Pride Partnership, the Women at Work ERG and the Empowered Parents and Caregivers ERG. Encouraging engagement through one of our nine ERGs creates meaningful connections through shared experiences and learning about different cultures and lived experiences for deeper understanding and knowledge. Their strategic priorities include recruiting and retaining diverse employees, identifying and participating in community volunteerism opportunities, building cultural competency among our employees and positively impacting the business.\nTraining and Professional Development\nAt AEP, we are preparing our workforce for the future by providing opportunities to learn new skills and engaging higher education institutions to better prepare the next generation with the skills that we will need. AEP has a growing co-op and internship program for high school and college students. Our alliances with community colleges, universities and vocational and technical schools across our 11-state service territory support the development of our talent pipeline. We work with these institutions to develop academic programs that will prepare students for new jobs and career opportunities in our industry. AEP also provides a broad range of training and assistance that supports lifelong learning and transition development. This is especially important as we move closer toward a digital future that requires a more flexible, innovative and diverse workforce. AEP has robust processes to achieve this, including ongoing performance coaching, operational skills training, resources to support our commitment to environment, safety and health, job progression training, tuition assistance, and other forms of training that help employees improve their skills and become better leaders.\nIn 2023, AEP employees completed more than 806,000 hours of training in programs for which we track participation. In addition, AEP invested more than $2 million in employee education, supporting approximately 560 employees through our tuition reimbursement program.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAEP is committed to the well-being of our employees and we offer programs to foster employee financial security; physical and emotional health; and social connectedness. We provide market competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees and their families to help them thrive at home and work. We ensure the pay we offer is competitive in the marketplace by pricing many of our positions using robust compensation survey information. Nearly all AEP employees participate in an annual incentive program that rewards individual performance and achievement of business goals, which fosters a high-performance culture. AEP also offers paid time off in the form of vacation, holidays, sick time and parental leave. The company\u2019s employee assistance plan, medical and dental coverage, life insurance and well-being program help employees and their families stay healthy and feeling their best. Additionally, AEP\u2019s retirement programs position our employees for financial stability in retirement.\nLabor Relations\nNearly one fourth of AEP\u2019s workforce is represented by labor unions. We value the relationships we have with our union represented employees and believe in a trusting, collaborative and respectful partnership. We continuously work to strengthen these relationships to ensure we have a culture that attracts and supports employees who can adapt to the rapid changes occurring in our company and industry. Our relationship with labor unions is critical to meeting the growing expectations of our customers and adapting to the challenges of rapidly changing technologies.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nAEP\u2019s Reportable Segments\nAEP\u2019s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. AEP\u2019s reportable segments are as follows:\n\u2022Vertically Integrated Utilities\n\u2022Transmission and Distribution Utilities\n\u2022AEP Transmission Holdco\n\u2022Generation & Marketing\nThe remainder of AEP\u2019s activities is presented as Corporate and Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. See Note 9 - Business Segments included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information on AEP\u2019s segments.\nSeasonality\nThe consumption and delivery of electric power is generally seasonal which impacts the results of operations of AEP\u2019s reportable segments. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP\u2019s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters. In addition, AEP has historically sold and delivered less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP\u2019s results of operations. In Texas, unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP\u2019s results of operations. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP\u2019s results of operations.\nVERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES\nGENERAL\nAEP\u2019s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. AEPSC, as agent for AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel procurement and power-related risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries.\nELECTRIC GENERATION\nFacilities\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned approximately 23,000 MWs of generation. See Item 2 - Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries.\nFuel Supply\nThe following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type (including wind purchase agreements), on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:\nAn increase/decrease in one or more generation types relative to previous years reflects the addition of renewable resources, retirement of traditional fossil fuel units and price changes in one or more fuel commodity sources relative to the pricing of other fuel commodity sources. AEP\u2019s overall 2023 fossil fuel costs for the Vertically Integrated Utilities decreased 28.3% on a dollar per MMBtu basis from 2022.\nCoal and Lignite\nAEP\u2019s Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term contracts, affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers, marketers and coal trading firms. Coal and lignite consumption decreased 23.9% in 2023 (exclusive of fuel oil) from 2022 due to a combination of the retirement of the Pirkey Power Plant in March 2023 and lower generation at the coal fired power plants due to a significant decline in natural gas prices. AEP\u2019s Vertically Integrated Utilities operations no longer use lignite as a fuel source after the retirement of the Pirkey Power Plant.\nManagement projects that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal of adequate quality and quantities to operate their coal fired units. As of December 31, 2023, through subsidiaries, AEP owns, leases or controls 3,180 railcars, 319 barges, 4 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in AEP generating facilities. AEP will procure additional railcar and barge/towboat capacity as needed based on demand.\nThe market price for coal began 2023 elevated as compared to recent years, but declined and stabilized as the year progressed. Although the price of coal in 2023 was lower as compared to 2021 and 2022, the price of coal in 2023 is still higher than historical prices prior to 2021. Coal prices are currently projected to remain at these levels due to increased mining costs experienced over the last few years. AEP\u2019s strategy for purchasing coal includes layering in supplies over time to help with reducing price volatility. The price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent years when the coal is delivered. The price paid for coal and lignite delivered in 2023 increased approximately 14.5% from 2022 mainly due to the increase in coal prices contracted in prior years. With the elevated prices for coal contracted in 2021 and 2022, management anticipates that delivered coal prices will continue to be higher over the next few years.\nThe following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities\u2019 plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal and lignite purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:\n2023 2022 2021\nTotal coal and lignite delivered to the plants (in millions of tons) 20.9 20.4 18.2\nAverage cost per ton of coal and lignite delivered $ 64.31 $ 56.16 $ 50.76\nThe coal supplies at the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, coal consumption rates, labor issues, supplier outages and issues and weather conditions, all of which may interrupt or slow production, consumption or deliveries. As of December 31, 2023, the Vertically Integrated Utilities\u2019 coal inventory was approximately 82 days of full load burn. Inventory levels grew significantly in 2023 due to mild weather conditions, lower demand for electric power and a decline in natural gas prices. Management expects inventory levels to remain elevated in 2024 due to many of these same factors. While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary, the current coal inventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 34 days of full load burn.\nNatural Gas\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed approximately 146 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2023 for generating power. This represents an increase of 15.8% from 2022. Several of AEP\u2019s natural gas-fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability. From a natural gas supply perspective, the Vertically Integrated Utilities utilize daily spot market purchases, as well as longer-term arrangements including monthly baseload, forward month baseload, seasonal baseload and long-term firm purchases. From a natural gas transportation perspective, the Vertically Integrated Utilities utilize firm and interruptible transportation capacity. AEP\u2019s natural gas supply, transportation and storage transactions are competitively bid and are based on current market prices.\nThe following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities\u2019 plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:\n2023 2022 2021\nTotal natural gas delivered to the plants (in billions cubic feet) 146.0 126.0 108.0\nAverage delivered price per MMBtu of purchased natural gas $ 2.69 $ 6.94 $ 8.92\nNuclear\nI&M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant. I&M has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot, short-term and mid-term markets.\nFor purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of SNF, I&M completed modifications to its SNF storage pool in the early 1990\u2019s. I&M entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of SNF to permit normal operations to continue. I&M is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis. The year of expiration of each NRC Operating License is 2034 for Unit 1 and 2037 for Unit 2. Management is currently evaluating applying for license extensions for both units.\nNuclear Waste and Decommissioning\nAs the owner of the Cook Plant, I&M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely. The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the SNF disposal program. The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2021. The estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was $2.2 billion in 2021 non-discounted dollars, with additional ongoing estimated costs of $7 million per year for post decommissioning storage of SNF and an eventual estimated cost of $33 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility, also in 2021 non-discounted dollars. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately $3.5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. The balance of funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns. The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the:\n\u2022Escalation of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation and the cost of energy).\n\u2022Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning.\n\u2022Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies.\n\u2022Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities.\n\u2022Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of SNF.\nAccordingly, management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current projections. AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections. See the \u201cNuclear Contingencies\u201d section of Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning.\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste\nThe Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste rests with the individual states. Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials. Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available. I&M cannot predict when such a site may be available. However, the states of Utah and Texas have licensed low-level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low-level radioactive waste from Michigan waste generators. There is currently no set date limiting I&M\u2019s access to either of these facilities. The Cook Plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low-level radioactive waste. In the event that low-level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable, it can be stored onsite at this facility.\nCounterparty Risk Management\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants. As a result, counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions. As of December 31, 2023, counterparties posted approximately $36 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately $200 million with counterparties and exchanges). Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily. See the \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nCertain Power Agreements\nI&M\nA UPA between AEGCo and I&M (the I&M Power Agreement) provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the power (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant unless it is sold to another utility. I&M is obligated, whether or not power is available from AEGCo, to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and as an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M) net of amounts received by AEGCo from any other sources, sufficient to enable AEGCo to pay all of its operating and other expenses, including a rate of return on the common equity of AEGCo as approved by the FERC. The UPA will continue in effect until the debt obligations of AEGCo secured by the Rockport Plant have been satisfied and discharged (currently expected to be December 2028).\nIn April 2021, AEGCo and I&M executed an agreement to purchase 100% of the interests in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 effective at the end of the lease term on December 7, 2022. Prior to the termination of the lease, I&M assigned 30% of the power to KPCo. Beginning December 8, 2022, AEGCo billed 100% of its share of the Rockport Plant to I&M and ceased billing to KPCo. KPCo reached an agreement with I&M, from the end of the lease through May 2024, to buy capacity from Rockport Plant, Unit 2 through the PCA at a rate equal to PJM\u2019s RPM clearing price. See the \u201cUnit Power Agreements\u201d section of Note 16 - Related Party Transactions for additional information.\nOVEC\nAEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC. The aggregate equity participation of AEP in OVEC is 43.47%. Parent owns 39.17% and OPCo owns 4.3%. Under the Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA), which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each, the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. The ICPA terminates in June 2040. The proceeds from charges by OVEC to sponsoring companies under the ICPA based on their power participation ratios are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs. OVEC\u2019s Board of Directors, as elected by AEP and nonaffiliated owners, has authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests, with resulting expenses (including for related debt and interest thereon) included in charges under the ICPA. OVEC financed capital expenditures in excess of $1 billion in connection with flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances, including tax-advantaged debt issuances. Both OVEC generation plants are operating with the environmental controls in-service. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information.\nELECTRIC DELIVERY\nGeneral\nOther than AEGCo, AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power. See Item 2 - Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines. Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories. These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC. See Item 1. Business - Vertically Integrated Utilities - Regulation - Rates. The FERC regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts. The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, principles, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and SPP, and as approved by the FERC. See Item 1. Business - Vertically Integrated Utilities - Regulation - FERC. As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies.\nOther than AEGCo, AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas. In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory. These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates. In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business. For a discussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item 1. Business - Vertically Integrated Utilities - Competition.\nTransmission Agreement\nAPCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA. OPCo, which is a subsidiary in AEP\u2019s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment that provides transmission service under the PJM OATT, is also a party to the TA. The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM. The TA has been approved by the FERC.\nTransmission Coordination Agreement and Open Access Transmission Tariff\nPSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA. Under the TCA, a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of: (a) overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement, including the performance of transmission planning studies, (b) the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and (c) compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff. Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement. The TCA also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT. These allocations have been determined by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP.\nRegional Transmission Organizations\nAEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM, and PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP (both FERC-approved RTOs). RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.\nREGULATION\nGeneral\nAEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries\u2019 retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional cost-based regulation by the state utility commissions. AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions. I&M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook Plant. AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of, much of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which is administered by the FERC.\nRates\nHistorically, state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service. A utility\u2019s cost-of-service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of: (a) a utility\u2019s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility\u2019s level of investment. Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers. Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time.\nPublic utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in-service. Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery. Given long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets, management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow. AEP representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative rate-making options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process. These options include pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates.\nThe rates of AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service). Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility\u2019s rates and tariffs. Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes.\nThe following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate. Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction. See Note 4 - Rate Matters included in the 2023 Annual Report for more information regarding pending rate matters.\nIndiana\nI&M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a forecasted cost-of-service basis. Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through respective fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms.\nOklahoma\nPSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC. PSO\u2019s rates are set on a cost-of-service basis. Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded through a fuel adjustment clause.\nVirginia\nAPCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates approved by the Virginia SCC. Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel cost recovery mechanism. In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.\nWest Virginia\nAPCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis. West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs and transmission expenses through the ENEC which trues-up to actual expenses. See \u201cENEC Filings\u201d section of Note 4 - Rate Matters included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information. In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo and WPCo are permitted to recover a variety of costs through surcharges.\nFERC\nThe FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects. The FERC regulations require AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and AEP has approved cost-based formula transmission rates on file at the FERC. The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers. In addition, the FERC regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by: (a) approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities at cost-based rates and (b) granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices. AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have market-based rate authority from the FERC, under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place. The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities, directly or through an RTO, to file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility\u2019s own uses of its transmission system. The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities\u2019 transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility\u2019s marketing employees. Additionally, the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC, which standards protect the nation\u2019s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.\nThe FERC oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility transmission assets. AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM. PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP.\nThe FERC has jurisdiction over certain issuances of securities of most of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition of securities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding\ncompany. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.\nCOMPETITION\nAEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries primarily generate, transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories. These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC, and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities. Other than AEGCo, AEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.\nAEP\u2019s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas. The primary factors in such competition are price, reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power. With respect to competing generators and self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they currently maintain a competitive position.\nChanges in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production. The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive. The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP\u2019s competitiveness.\nTRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES\nGENERAL\nThis segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo.\nAEP\u2019s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power. See Item 2 - Properties, for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines. Transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP\u2019s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories. These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for AEP Texas and by the PUCO and the FERC for OPCo. The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions. As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies.\nAEP\u2019s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas. In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service. These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates. In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.\nThe use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC. In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas, AEP\u2019s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies through RTOs.\nTransmission Agreement\nOPCo owns and operates transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT; OPCo is a party to the TA with other utility subsidiary affiliates. The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM. The TA has been approved by the FERC.\nRegional Transmission Organizations\nOPCo is a member of PJM, a FERC-approved RTO. RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not. AEP Texas is a member of ERCOT.\nREGULATION\nOPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates approved by the PUCO or by the FERC. AEP Texas sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Cost of Services (TCOS) and Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) filings. AEP Texas may file interim TCOS and DCRF filings semi-annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital. Transmission and distribution rates are established on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service. The cost-of-service generally reflects operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes. Utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of: (a) a utility\u2019s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility\u2019s level of investment.\nFERC\nThe FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters. The FERC regulations require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and it has approved cost-based formula transmission rates on file at the FERC. The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers. The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility\u2019s own uses of its transmission system. The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities\u2019 transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility\u2019s marketing employees. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system. Additionally, the transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to mandatory reliability standards as set forth by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC, which standards protect the nation\u2019s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.\nAEP TRANSMISSION HOLDCO\nGENERAL\nAEPTHCo is a holding company for (a) AEPTCo, which is the direct holding company for the State Transcos and (b) AEP\u2019s Transmission Joint Ventures.\nAEPTCo\nAEPTCo wholly owns the State Transcos which are independent of, but respectively overlay, the following AEP electric utility operating companies: APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. The State Transcos develop, own, operate and maintain their respective transmission assets. Individual State Transcos (a) have obtained the approvals necessary to operate in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, subject to any applicable siting requirements, (b) are authorized to submit projects for commission approval in Virginia and (c) have been granted consent to enter into a joint license agreement that will support investment in Tennessee. Assets of the State Transcos interconnect to transmission facilities owned by the aforementioned operating companies and nonaffiliated transmission owners within the footprints of PJM, MISO and SPP. APTCo, IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo and WVTCo are located within PJM. IMTCo also owns portions of the Greentown station assets located in MISO. OKTCo and SWTCo are located within SPP. SWTCo does not currently own or operate transmission assets.\nThe State Transcos own, operate, maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability, grid security, safety, reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources and new wholesale customers, as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets. A key part of AEP\u2019s business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP System as needed to maintain reliability. As of December 31, 2023, the State Transcos had $14.2 billion of transmission and other assets in-service, excluding CWIP, with plans to construct approximately $3.4 billion of additional transmission assets through 2026.\nAEPTHCO JOINT VENTURE INITIATIVES\nAEP has established joint ventures with non-affiliated electric utility companies for the purpose of developing, building and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in North America (Transmission Joint Ventures). The Transmission Joint Ventures currently include:\n(a)ETT is undertaking multiple projects and the completion dates will vary for those projects. ETT\u2019s investment in completed and active projects in ERCOT is expected to be $5.0 billion by 2030. Future projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n(b)In May 2020, Pioneer received FERC approval authorizing an ROE of 10.02% (10.52% inclusive of the RTO incentive adder of 0.5%).\n(c)The ROE represents the weighted-average approved ROE based on the costs of two projects developed by Transource Missouri; the $64 million Iatan-Nashua project (10.3%) and the $247 million Sibley-Nebraska City project (11.3%).\n(d)AEP owns 86.5% of Transource Missouri, Transource West Virginia, Transource Maryland, Transource Pennsylvania and Transource Oklahoma through its ownership interest in Transource Energy, LLC (Transource). Transource is a joint venture with AEPTHCo and Evergy, Inc. formed to pursue competitive transmission projects. AEPTHCo and Evergy, Inc. own 86.5% and 13.5% of Transource, respectively.\n(e)See \u201cIndependence Energy Connection Project\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\n(f)In 2016, Transource Kansas received approval from the FERC authorizing an ROE of 9.8% (10.3% inclusive of the RTO incentive adder of 0.5%) for future competitive transmission projects in SPP. In October 2020, Transource was awarded the Sooner-Wekiwa project by SPP and the project was assigned to Transource Kansas. In November 2020, Transource Kansas was renamed Transource Oklahoma. The project is expected to go in-service in 2026.\n(g)In October 2022, Transource Energy\u2019s North Delta A proposal was awarded by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. In December 2023, the North Delta project was expanded with additional scope and approved by the PJM Board of Managers. The project is expected to go in-service in 2027. The project was originally expected to go in-service in 2029.\nIn April 2023, AEP initiated a strategic evaluation for its ownership in Pioneer Transmission, LLC, Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC and Transource Energy. In July 2023, AEP made a decision to initiate a sales process for its investment in Pioneer Transmission, LLC and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC. In February 2024, AEP management determined it would retain its ownership of its investment in Pioneer Transmission, LLC and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net book value of Transource Energy was $289 million inclusive of $39 million related to noncontrolling interest on AEP\u2019s balance sheet. AEP management recently completed its strategic review and determined it would retain this business due to its fit within the goals and objectives of AEP and its overall leadership role in the U.S. electric transmission space.\nTransource Energy, and its subsidiaries Transource Missouri, Transource West Virginia, Transource Maryland, Transource Pennsylvania and Transource Oklahoma are consolidated joint ventures by AEP. All other joint ventures in the table above are not consolidated by AEP. AEP\u2019s joint ventures do not have employees. Business services for the joint ventures are provided by AEPSC and other AEP subsidiaries and the joint venture partners. In 2023, approximately 494 AEPSC employees and 317 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures.\nREGULATION\nThe State Transcos and the Transmission Joint Ventures located outside of ERCOT establish transmission rates annually through forward-looking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERC-approved implementation protocols. The protocols include a transparent, formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently-incurred and reasonably calculated.\nThe State Transcos\u2019 and the Transmission Joint Ventures\u2019 (where applicable) rates are included in the respective OATT for PJM and SPP. An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider\u2019s transmission system. The FERC requires transmission providers such as PJM and SPP to offer transmission service to all eligible customers (for example, load-serving entities, power marketers, generators and customers) on a non-discriminatory basis.\nThe FERC-approved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with the FERC. The formula rates establish rates for a one-year period based on the current projects in-service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe. The formula rates also include a true-up calculation for the previous year\u2019s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner\u2019s ATRR. PJM and SPP pay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the PJM and SPP OATTs, based on the terms and conditions in the respective OATT for the service taken. Additionally, the State Transcos are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of the FERC, which standards protect the nation\u2019s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. Management monitors pending matters before the FERC, including inquiries and challenges related to ROEs and transmission formula rates, that have the potential to reduce AEP\u2019s future transmission formula rates and/or the transmission ROE methodology.\nIn the annual rate base filings described above, the State Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of $10.7 billion, $9.9 billion and $8.4 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total filed transmission revenue requirements, including prior year over/under-recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges were $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe rates of ETT, which is located in ERCOT, are determined by the PUCT. ETT sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Cost of Services (TCOS) filings. ETT may file interim TCOS filings semi-annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital.\nGENERATION & MARKETING\nGENERAL\nThe AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of a wholesale energy trading and marketing business, a retail supply and energy management business and competitive generating assets.\nAEP Energy Supply, LLC is a holding company with several divisions, including AEP Energy, AEP OnSite Partners, AEPEP and AGR. AEP Energy Supply, LLC also included AEP Renewables prior to its sale in August 2023. For more information on the sale of AEP Renewables, see the \u201cContracted Renewable Generation Facilities\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis.\nAEP OnSite Partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge, innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities. AEP OnSite Partners targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers. AEP OnSite Partners pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers. As of December 31, 2023, AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 22 states, including approximately 195 MWs of installed solar capacity, and approximately 4 MWs of solar projects under construction.\nAEP Energy is a retail energy supplier and energy management business that supplies electricity and/or natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers. AEP Energy provides various energy solutions in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C. AEP Energy had approximately 929,000 customer accounts as of December 31, 2023.\nIn April 2023, AEP announced the initiation of a sales process for its ownership in AEP Onsite Partners and AEP Energy. The timing of the completion of the sales process is dependent upon a number of factors, but AEP is targeting the completion of the sales process in the first half of 2024. For more information, see the \u201c2023 Significant Developments and Transactions\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis.\nAEP Energy Partners enters into short-term and long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in ERCOT, SPP, MISO and PJM. In addition, AEP Energy Partners sells power into the market and engages in power, natural gas and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities. These activities primarily involve the purchase-and-sale of electricity (and to a lesser extent, natural gas and emissions allowances) under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices. These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options. The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts. These transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges.\nThe Generation & Marketing segment also includes AGR which holds the rights to Cardinal Plant Unit 1\u2019s power and capacity through 2028 through a PPA with a nonaffiliated electric cooperative.\nCOMPETITION\nThe AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power, capacity and ancillary services. The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation. Other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation, transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities, inoperability or inefficiencies, outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities. Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment.\nChanges in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production. The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP Onsite Partner\u2019s competitiveness. The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.\nAEP Energy provides competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and Washington, D.C. Each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market, and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition. Sustained low natural gas and power prices, low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business.\nCounterparty Risk Management\nCounterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions. As of December 31, 2023, counterparties posted approximately $117 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately $155 million with counterparties and exchanges). Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily. See the \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following persons are executive officers of AEP.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONS\nAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP\u2019s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of additional transmission and renewable generation facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure, installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives. AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions. If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments. This would cause financial results to be diminished.\nRegulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP\u2019s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. In certain instances, AEP\u2019s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval. AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.\nIf regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted. Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.\nIn addition, regulators have initiated and may initiate additional proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the AEP regulated utility businesses and in base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the regulated utility businesses seek to place in rates. The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the regulated utility businesses to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that they may not fully recover all costs during the rate effective period and may, therefore, earn less than their allowed returns. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, further exacerbating the regulatory lag and leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings.\nThe AEP regulated utility businesses have large customer and stakeholder bases and, as a result, could be the subject of public criticism or adverse publicity focused on issues including the operation and maintenance of their assets and infrastructure, their preparedness for major storms or other extreme weather events and/or the time it takes to restore service after such events, or the quality of their service or the reasonableness of the cost of their service. Criticism or adverse publicity of this nature could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could potentially negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes, as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements or other legislation or regulatory actions that adversely affect the regulated utility businesses.\nThe regulated utility businesses, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms, all of which could face resistance from customers and other stakeholders especially in a rising cost environment, whether due to inflation or high fuel prices or otherwise, and/or in periods of economic decline or hardship. Significant increases in costs could increase financing needs and otherwise adversely affect AEP\u2019s business, financial position, results of operation, or cash flows. See Note 4 - Rate Matters included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nAEP\u2019s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants)\nA significant portion of AEP\u2019s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities. FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction. If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP\u2019s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted. Management believes AEP\u2019s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities. However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.\nCertain elements of AEP\u2019s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)\nAEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC. The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates. All aspects of AEP\u2019s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative. In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true-up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP\u2019s formula rate implementation protocols. If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP\u2019s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.\nInquiries related to rates of return, as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities, are ongoing in other proceedings at the FERC. The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEP\u2019s formula rates. If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds, in any future cases related to its formula rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nEnd-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.\nAEP faces risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities. A key component of AEP's growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities. As part of these operations AEP must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions. Should AEP be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third-parties could have similar results.\nChanges in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology. Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it. Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines, small modular reactors and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery. These developments can challenge AEP\u2019s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and\nto provide cost-effective programs and services to customers. Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.\nAEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP\u2019s business plan for the construction of new projects, including providing service to new large load customers, involves a number of risks, including incomplete or inaccurate forecasting, planning and procurement, construction delays, non-performance by equipment and other third-party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP\u2019s subsidiaries enter into interconnection and service agreements, equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals, cost recovery and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including shifts in large customer needs, preferences or financial stability, failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals, cost recovery and/or siting or environmental permits, significant unrecoverable costs or cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur. In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.\nAEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nI&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,296 MWs, or about a tenth of the regulated generating capacity in the AEP System as of December 31, 2023. AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:\n\u2022The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF.\n\u2022Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.\n\u2022Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance unless the NRC specifies a lesser amount and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).\n\u2022Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.\nThere can be no assurance that I&M\u2019s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants. In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.\nCosts associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities. Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs. The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.\nAEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)\nResults are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets. The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues. Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased\ncosts to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design. In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights. As members of these RTOs, AEP\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation among existing members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.\nAEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)\nOwners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner. If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.\nA substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers. As of December 31, 2023, AEP Texas did business with approximately 124 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments. AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. In 2023, AEP Texas\u2019 two largest REPs accounted for 41% of its operating revenue. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.\nOhio House Bill 6 (HB 6), which provides for beneficial cost recovery for OPCo and for plants owned by OVEC, has come under public scrutiny. (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts, OVEC\u2019s coal-fired generating units and energy efficiency measures. AEP and OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates and Generation Now, an entity registered as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. Certain defendants in that case had previously plead guilty and, in March 2023, a federal jury convicted the Ohio legislator and another individual of participating in the racketeering conspiracy. If certain provisions of HB 6 were to be eliminated, it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted. To the extent that OPCo is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by HB 6, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. In addition, the impact of continued public scrutiny of HB 6 is not known and may have an adverse impact on AEP and OPCo, including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders. AEP is a defendant in current litigation relating to HB 6 and AEP or OPCo may be involved in future litigation.\nRISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKS\nAEP\u2019s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)\nPerformance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:\n\u2022Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.\n\u2022Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.\n\u2022Labor disputes.\n\u2022Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cybersecurity standards.\n\u2022Information technology failure that impairs AEP\u2019s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.\n\u2022Information technology failure that affects AEP\u2019s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP\u2019s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.\n\u2022Supply chain disruptions and inflation.\n\u2022Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.\n\u2022Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.\n\u2022Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.\nPhysical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP\u2019s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading. AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber-attack. The Federal government has notified the owners and operators of critical infrastructure, such as AEP, that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has increased the likelihood of a cyber-attack on such systems. In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.\nA security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses\u2019 physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system. AEP and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with ransomware theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data. A successful cyber-attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP\u2019s reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.\nAEP and its third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of remote access across the AEP subsidiaries, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks to date. Similarly, some of AEP\u2019s third-party vendors have experienced cybersecurity incidents, though such incidents have not, to AEP\u2019s knowledge, resulted in a material impact to AEP to date. However, AEP cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent future breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future. While AEP maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damages experienced. Also, the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.\nAEP is subject to standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by FERC regarding protection of critical infrastructure assets required for operating North America's bulk electric system. While AEP believes it is in compliance with such standards and regulations, AEP has been, and may in the future be, found to be in violation of such standards and regulations. To date, such violations have not resulted in material financial penalties; however, management can give no assurance that compliance efforts will not result in material penalties in the future. In addition, compliance with or changes in the applicable standards and regulations may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures as well as substantial fines for non-compliance.\nThe failure of AEP or third-party vendor information technology systems, or the failure to enhance existing information technology systems and implement new technology, could adversely affect AEP. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP\u2019s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, retirees and shareholders and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. Our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future. These providers\u2019 systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect AEP\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe amount of taxes imposed on AEP could change. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP is subject to income taxation at the federal level and by certain states and municipalities. In determining AEP\u2019s income tax liability for these jurisdictions, management monitors changes to the applicable tax laws and related regulations, including tax incentives and credits designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities. While management believes AEP complies with current prevailing laws, one or more taxing jurisdictions could seek to impose incremental or new taxes on the company. In addition, any adverse developments in tax laws, incentives, credits or regulations, including legislative changes, judicial holdings or administrative interpretations, could have a material and adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.\nIf AEP is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows or proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries or portions thereof, and insurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile. Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP\u2019s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness. In addition, AEP has exposure to international banks, including those in Europe, Canada, and Asia. Disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the AEP\u2019s ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 10%, 17%, and 16% of the Registrants\u2019 available credit facilities were with European, Canadian, and Asian banks, respectively.\nCertain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels. The public holds diverse and often conflicting views on the use of fossil fuels. AEP has multiple stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers, associates, federal and state regulatory authorities, and the communities in which AEP operates, and these stakeholders will often have differing priorities and expectations regarding issues related to the use of fossil fuels. Any adverse publicity in connection with AEP\u2019s use of fossil fuels could curtail availability from certain sources of capital. If sources of capital for AEP are reduced and/or expected sale proceeds do not become available, capital costs could increase materially. Restricted access to capital or insurance markets and/or increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. If AEP is not able to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance its operations and implement its strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity may limit AEP\u2019s ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on for future growth.\nOur financial position may be adversely impacted if announced dispositions do not occur as planned or if assets under strategic evaluation lose value. (Applies to AEP)\nIn April 2023, AEP initiated a sales process for its ownership in AEP Energy and AEP Onsite Partners. AEP Onsite Partners also owns a 50% interest in NM Renewable Development, LLC, (NMRD). Separate from the remainder of AEP Onsite Partners, AEP and the joint owner have signed an agreement in December 2023 to sell NMRD to a non-affiliated third-party.\nAny planned sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries, may not occur for any number of reasons beyond our control, including regulatory approval. If AEP is unable to recover the net book value or carrying value of these assets as part of the sale process, it could reduce future net income and impact financial condition.\nShareholder activism could cause AEP to incur significant expense, hinder execution of AEP\u2019s business strategy and impact AEP\u2019s stock price. (Applies to all Registrants)\nShareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and AEP\u2019s board\u2019s attention and resources from AEP\u2019s business. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEP\u2019s future, adversely affect AEP\u2019s relationships with its employees, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, AEP may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors. AEP\u2019s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.\nDowngrades in AEP\u2019s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP\u2019s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations. AEP\u2019s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive. If AEP\u2019s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP\u2019s interest costs will likely increase and that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\nAEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)\nAEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own. Their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries, primarily their regulated utilities, and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to them or repay loans from them. Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo) to provide them with funds for their payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments. Payments to AEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations. AEP and AEPTCo indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.\nAEP\u2019s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)\nElectric power consumption is generally seasonal. In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP\u2019s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.\nFurther, deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause, including international tariffs, generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues. As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\nVolatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning. (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)\nThe costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of AEP\u2019s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.\nAdditionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.\nSupply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact our operations and corporate strategy. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP\u2019s operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure the equipment, materials and other resources necessary to build and provide services in a safe and reliable manner. The delivery of components, materials, equipment and other resources that are critical to AEP\u2019s business operations and corporate strategy has been restricted by domestic and global supply chain upheaval. This has resulted in the shortage of critical items. International tensions, including the ramifications of regional conflict, could further exacerbate the global supply chain upheaval. These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations and corporate strategy. The constraints in the supply chain could restrict the availability and delay the construction, maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support normal operations or are required to execute on AEP\u2019s corporate strategy for continued capital investment in utility equipment and impact AEP\u2019s strategy to transition its generation fleet. These disruptions and constraints could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP\u2019s financial condition.\nSupply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment and other needed commodities and these inflationary increases may continue in the future. The economy in the United States has encountered a material level of inflation compared to the recent past and that has contributed to increased uncertainty in the outlook of near-term economic activity, including the level of future inflation and the possibility of a recession. AEP typically recovers increases in capital expenses from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions. Failure to recover increased capital costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP\u2019s financial condition. Increases in inflation raises our costs for labor, materials and services, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial condition.\nAEP\u2019s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, a decline in customer demand or a recession. (Applies to all Registrants)\nGrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity, including changes due to public health considerations.\nCertain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption. Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include\npotential higher rates of existing employee departures, lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business. If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.\nChanges in the price of purchased power and commodities, the cost of procuring fuel, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP\u2019s cost of purchasing and producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nAEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of purchased power and fuel (including the cost to procure coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel. AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts. AEP typically recovers increases in fuel expenses and purchased power from customers in regulated jurisdictions. Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP\u2019s financial condition. The inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life, and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover such costs. Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances. AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures. Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances available through either EPA original issuance or market purchases to cover projected needs for the next two years and beyond. Additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions. If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs. AEP\u2019s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.\nPrices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past. Changes in the cost of purchased power, fuel or emission allowances and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material. As a result, as those transactions are marked-to-market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nAEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)\nClimate change creates physical and financial risk. Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as fires. Customers\u2019 energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers\u2019 energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.\nIncreased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load. Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues. AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP\u2019s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP\u2019s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.\nSevere weather and weather-related events impact AEP\u2019s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur. To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase, AEP\u2019s cost of providing service will increase, including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts, and these costs may not be recoverable. Changes in wind patterns or in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally wind generation facilities for changes in wind patterns and the fossil fuel generating units for changes in precipitation. A change in wind patterns or a negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP\u2019s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy. AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.\nTo the extent climate change impacts a region\u2019s economic health, it may also impact revenues. AEP\u2019s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves. The price of energy, as a factor in a region\u2019s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within AEP\u2019s service territories. Climate change may impact the economy, which could impact our sales and revenues. The cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation of carbon dioxide emissions, could impact the availability of goods and prices charged by AEP\u2019s suppliers which would normally be borne by consumers through higher prices for energy and purchased goods. To the extent financial markets view climate change and carbon dioxide emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively affect AEP\u2019s ability to access capital markets or cause AEP to receive less than ideal terms and conditions in capital markets.\nThe generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of damage to private property and injury to AEP\u2019s workforce and the general public. (Applies to all Registrants)\nElectricity poses hazards for AEP\u2019s workforce and the general public in the event that either comes in contact with electrical current or equipment, including through energized downed power lines or through equipment malfunctions. In addition, the risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generation and storage facilities include public and workforce safety issues and the risk of utility assets causing or contributing to wildfires. Deaths, injuries and property damage caused by such events can subject AEP to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be significant. In addition, AEP may be held responsible for the actions of its contractors. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of AEP\u2019s or its contractors\u2019 insurance coverage.\nManagement cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP\u2019s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2023 Annual Report. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.\nDisruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services. (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third-parties. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nManagement is unable to predict the course, results or impact, if any, of current or future litigation or investigations relating to the severe winter weather in Texas in February 2021. (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAs a result of the February 2021 severe winter weather in Texas which caused a shortage of electric generation, ERCOT instructed AEP Texas and other Texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained large-scale outage and prevent long-term damage to the electric system. At its peak, approximately 468,000 (44%) AEP Texas customers were without power. In February 2021, AEP Texas received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Attorney General of Texas requesting, among other data, information about its communications to and from ERCOT, PUCT, retail electric providers, utilities, or power generation companies, concerning power outages related to the February 2021 winter storm. The company responded to the Civil Investigative Demand in March 2021.\nAEP Parent and AEP Texas are named in approximately 100 lawsuits alleging multiple claims of wrongful death, personal injury, property damage and other injuries and damages. Certain wind farms formerly owned by AEP have also been named as defendants in up to approximately 125 lawsuits, along with other Texas energy companies and transmission and distribution utilities. Most of the lawsuits contain hundreds of plaintiffs and one of the suits is a purported class action on behalf of all customers in ERCOT. The complaints seek monetary damages among other forms of relief.\nThe litigation has been consolidated into a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding in Texas state court. The judge overseeing the MDL issued an initial case management order and stayed all proceedings and discovery. Management is unable to predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact, if any, on future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nHazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP\u2019s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks. The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP\u2019s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.\nAEPTCo depends on AEP affiliates for a substantial portion of its revenues. (Applies to AEPTCo)\nAEPTCo\u2019s principal transmission service customers are AEP affiliates. Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo\u2019s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2023, AEP affiliates were responsible for approximately 79% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.\nMost of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates. (Applies to AEPTCo)\nAEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located. Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP subsidiary utility affiliate that overlay its operations. The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property. AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP subsidiary utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP subsidiary utility affiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.\nCompliance with legislative and regulatory requirements may lead to increased costs and result in penalties. (Applies to all Registrants)\nBusiness activities of electric utilities and related companies are heavily regulated, primarily through national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters. Many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. Registrants are subject to the jurisdiction of many federal and state agencies, including the FERC, NERC, Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Federal EPA, NRC, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the SEC and the United States Department of Justice which may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to AEP\u2019s business, which could have a material adverse effect on financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase AEP\u2019s operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services AEP offers, or result in adverse publicity and harm AEP\u2019s reputation.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWER\nCosts of compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nOperations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety. A majority of the electricity generated by AEP subsidiaries is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or CCR) resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses. Compliance with these legal requirements (including any new and more stringent application of existing CCR regulations) requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission limits, CCR waste discharge and/or discharge disposal obligations are tightened, more extensive operating and/or permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances or facilities become regulated. Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants. Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions and/or voluntary climate goals could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nFederal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide and methane, from electric generation units using fossil fuels like coal. The potential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on AEP's electric generation units are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-effective, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, and the range of available compliance alternatives.\nAEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs take into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The objective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers. Based on the output of the company\u2019s IRPs, in October 2022, AEP announced new intermediate and long-term CO2 emission reduction goals. AEP adjusted its near-term CO2 emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005 baseline, upgraded its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full Scope 1 emissions and accelerated its net-zero goal by five years to 2045 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Risks to achieving these goals include, among other things, the ability to execute on renewable resource plans, evolving RTO requirements, regulatory approvals, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential tariffs, carbon policy and regulation, operational performance of renewable generation and supply chain costs and constraints, all while continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers. Technology research and development, innovation, and advancements in carbon-free generation are also critical to AEP\u2019s ability to achieve its 2045 goal.\nAEP\u2019s results of operations could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state laws or regulations or voluntary climate goals impose any new greenhouse gas emission limits. Any future limits on greenhouse gas emissions could create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emissions allowances, require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology, fuel switching, or the replacement of high-emitting generation facilities with lower-emitting generation facilities and/or could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. Although AEP typically recovers environmental expenditures, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. Further, real or alleged violations of environmental regulations, including those related to climate change, or an inability to meet AEP\u2019s voluntary climate goals, could adversely impact AEP\u2019s reputation.\nAEP may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on time. In addition, new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed including new resources such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if AEP invests in early-stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, AEP\u2019s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2045 at a cost-effective price could be at risk. Achieving our carbon reduction goals will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies\nincluding nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability in a carbon constrained environment. AEP cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving these objectives, or the various implementation aspects, on its system reliability, or its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nAEP may be unable to procure or construct generation capacity when needed or to recover the costs of such generation capacity. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nAEP\u2019s capacity obligations are subject to a number of factors including load growth, requirements that can be imposed by the states, RTOs and other jurisdictions in which it operates or participates as a member and the retirement of existing generating facilities. AEP must obtain new and replacement generation to comply with prevailing capacity needs and reserve obligations. AEP\u2019s ability to acquire, retrofit and/or construct power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for capital, materials, labor, and environmental compliance, reliance on suppliers for timely and satisfactory performance, continued pandemic-related delays and cost increases, and supply chains and material constraints, including those that may result from major storm events. Delays in obtaining permits, challenges in securing suitable land for the siting, shortages in materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition, suppliers and contractors not performing as expected or required under their contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, further direct and indirect trade and tariff issues, supply chain delays or disruptions, and other events beyond AEP\u2019s control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of needed acquisitions or construction projects. If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, AEP could incur additional costs and termination payments or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, AEP could be exposed to higher costs, penalties and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should one or more applicable regulator decline to approve the acquisition or construction of the project or new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost.\nCourts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nIn the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants. In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants\u2019 power plants constitute a public nuisance. The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief. If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP\u2019s existing coal-fired power plants could be required, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP\u2019s commitments to supply power to AEP customers. This could have a material impact on revenues. In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations. Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition. Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.\nCommodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nAEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP\u2019s trading portfolio. To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position. AEP\u2019s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements. To the extent that AEP\u2019s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices. In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts. These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements. If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.\nParties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP\u2019s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances, renewable energy credits and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations. AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP\nmoney or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP\u2019s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses. Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.\nAEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control. If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP\u2019s power. (Applies to all Registrants)\nAEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale. This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks. If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power. If a region\u2019s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP\u2019s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.\nThe FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales. Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable. Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.\nOVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support. (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo)\nAEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it. Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness. As of December 31, 2023, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $465 million through the ICPA. Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC\u2019s outstanding debt through the ICPA and if OVEC\u2019s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%.\nNew climate disclosure rules proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may increase our costs of compliance and adversely impact our business. (Applies to all Registrants)\nOn March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks. AEP is currently assessing the proposed rule, but at this time AEP cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the rule. To the extent this rule is finalized as proposed, AEP could incur increased costs relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks. AEP may also face increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rule if finalized as proposed. In addition, enhanced climate disclosure requirements could accelerate the trend of certain stakeholders and lenders restricting or seeking more stringent conditions with respect to their investments in certain carbon-intensive sectors.",

    "item_1C": "ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nThe electric utility industry is an identified critical infrastructure function with mandatory cybersecurity requirements under the authority of FERC. The NERC, which FERC certified as the nation\u2019s Electric Reliability Organization, developed mandatory critical infrastructure protection cybersecurity reliability standards. AEP\u2019s service territory covers multiple NERC regions and is audited at least annually by one or more of the regions. AEP has participated in the NERC grid security and emergency response exercises, GridEx, for the past ten years and continues to participate in the bi-yearly exercises. These NERC-led efforts test and further develop the coordination, threat sharing and interaction between utilities and various government\nagencies relative to potential cyber and physical threats against the nation\u2019s electric grid. AEP also conducts internal exercises to test and further refine AEP\u2019s cyber response plans. These internal scenarios are chosen based on real world events and often include coordination with and communication to AEP\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and executive team.\nThe operations of AEP\u2019s electric utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cyber and physical security requirements that are developed and enforced by NERC to protect grid security and reliability. AEP\u2019s enterprise-wide security program includes cyber and physical security and incorporates many of the guidelines set forth in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. AEP has a primary and a back-up NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection Senior Manager, who is responsible for ensuring alignment of compliance with the enterprise-wide security program.\nCritical cyber assets, such as data centers, power plants, transmission operations centers and business networks are protected using multiple layers of cybersecurity controls and authentication. Cyber hackers and other malicious actors have caused material disruption by successfully breaching a number of very secure facilities of entities across the spectrum of industries, including federal agencies and financial institutions. As understanding of these events develop, AEP has adopted a defense in depth approach to cybersecurity and continually assesses its cybersecurity tools and processes to determine where to strengthen its defenses. These strategies include monitoring, alerting and emergency response, forensic analysis, disaster recovery, threat sharing and criminal activity reporting. This approach has allowed AEP to deal with cyber and related threats, intrusions and attempted breaches in real-time and to limit their impact to levels that would be expected in the ordinary course of business in the absence of such malicious activity. AEP is not aware of any occurrence from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect AEP\u2019s business strategy, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAEP has undertaken a variety of actions to monitor and address cyber-related risks. Cybersecurity and the effectiveness of AEP\u2019s cybersecurity processes are reviewed annually with the Board of Directors and at several meetings throughout the year with the Technology Committee of the Board, the principal committee that exercises oversight with respect to these matters. AEP\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and executive team participate in interactive threat briefings from AEP\u2019s Chief Security Officer and/or Chief Information & Technology Officer on a regular basis. AEP\u2019s strategy and procedure for managing cyber-related risks is integrated within its enterprise risk management processes. These procedures are designed to ensure that any material information regarding potentially relevant cyber incidents is elevated in a timely manner both to the appropriate leadership and, where applicable, to our external financial reporting and disclosure team. AEP\u2019s enterprise-wide security program continually adjusts staff and resources in response to the evolving threat landscape. The costs for such investments are material and have remained generally consistent over time, a pattern that is expected to continue. In addition, AEP maintains cyber liability insurance to cover certain damages caused by cyber incidents.\nAEP maintains dedicated cybersecurity and physical security teams which are responsible for the design, implementation and execution of AEP\u2019s security risk management strategy, which includes cybersecurity. AEP\u2019s cybersecurity team operates a 24/7 Cybersecurity Intelligence and Response Center responsible for monitoring the AEP System for cyber risks and threats. The cybersecurity team constantly scans the AEP System for cyber risks and threats. In addition, the cybersecurity team actively monitors best practices, performs penetration testing, leads response exercises and internal awareness campaigns and provides training and communication across the organization. AEP\u2019s security awareness training is mandatory for all employees and includes regular phish email testing to train employees to identify malicious emails that could put AEP at risk.\nAEP also continually reviews its business continuity plan to develop an effective recovery strategy that seeks to decrease response times, limit financial impacts and maintain customer confidence during any business interruption. AEP administers a third-party risk governance program that identifies potential risks introduced through third-party relationships, such as vendors, software and hardware manufacturers or professional service providers. As warranted, AEP obtains certain contractual security guarantees and assurances with these third-party relationships to help ensure the security and safety of its information. The cyber security team works closely with a broad range of departments, including legal, regulatory, corporate communications, internal audit services, information technology and operational technology functions critical to the power grid.\nThe cybersecurity team collaborates with partners from both industry and government, and routinely participates in industry-wide programs that exchange knowledge of threats with utility peers, industry and federal agencies. AEP is an active member of a number of industry-specific threat and information sharing communities including the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the National Defense Information Sharing and Analysis Center. AEP participates in classified briefings to maintain an awareness of current cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. AEP continues to work with nonaffiliated entities to do penetration testing and to design and implement appropriate remediation strategies. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent material interruption of services or other damages to AEP's business or operations in connection with any cyber-related incident. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Market, Economic or Financial Volatility and Other Risks - Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP\u2019s reputation\u201d.",

See Item 1 for additional information relating to the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines by operating company.\nTITLE TO PROPERTY\nThe AEP System\u2019s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple. The greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the AEP System has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority. The rights of AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business. Minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist, but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties. AEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them, if necessary, to acquire, perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations.\nSYSTEM TRANSMISSION LINES AND FACILITY SITING\nLaws in the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities and/or routes of high-voltage transmission lines. AEP has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which AEP\u2019s operating companies have sought to acquire rights-of-way through condemnation. These proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years.\nCONSTRUCTION PROGRAM\nWith input from its state utility commissions, AEP subsidiaries continuously assess the adequacy of their transmission, distribution, generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers. In this assessment process, assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified, as appropriate. AEP forecasts approximately $7.5 billion of construction expenditures for 2024. Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain issues, weather, legal reviews, inflation and the ability to access capital. See the \u201cBudgeted Capital Expenditures\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.\nPOTENTIAL UNINSURED LOSSES\nSome potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities, including liabilities relating to damage to AEP\u2019s generation plants and costs of replacement power. Unless allowed to be recovered through rates, future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could reduce net income and impact the financial conditions of AEP and subsidiaries.

AEP\u2019s electric utility operating companies provide generation, transmission and distribution services to more than five million retail customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries operate an extensive portfolio of assets including:\n\u2022Approximately 225,000 circuit miles of distribution lines that deliver electricity to 5.6 million customers.\n\u2022Approximately 40,000 circuit miles of transmission lines, including approximately 2,200 circuit miles of 765 kV lines, the backbone of the electric interconnection grid in the eastern United States.\n\u2022Approximately 23,000 MWs of regulated owned generating capacity as of December 31, 2023, one of the largest complements of generation in the United States.\nAEP CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2023 Compared to 2022\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders decreased from $2.3 billion in 2022 to $2.2 billion in 2023 primarily due to:\n\u2022A decrease in weather-related sales volumes.\n\u2022An increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates and debt balances.\n\u2022Unfavorable mark-to-market economic hedge activity driven by a decrease in commodity prices.\n\u2022A loss on the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio in 2023.\n\u2022Unfavorable regulatory decisions in Texas, West Virginia and at FERC.\n\u2022A gain on the sale of mineral rights in 2022.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022Favorable rate proceedings in AEP\u2019s various jurisdictions.\n\u2022Investment in transmission assets, which resulted in higher revenues and income.\n\u2022A loss related to the expected sale of the Kentucky Operations in 2022. The expected sale was terminated in April 2023.\n\u2022An impairment of AEP\u2019s equity investment in Flat Ridge 2 in 2022.\nSee \u201cResults of Operations\u201d section for additional information by operating segment.\nCustomer Demand\nAEP\u2019s weather-normalized retail sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 2.5% from the year ended December 31, 2022. Weather-normalized residential sales decreased 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 7.8% in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in commercial sales was primarily due to new data center loads and economic development. AEP\u2019s 2023 industrial sales volumes increased 1.6% compared to 2022. The growth in industrial sales was spread across many industries.\nIn 2024, AEP anticipates weather-normalized retail sales volumes will increase by 1.5%. Weather-normalized residential sales volumes are projected to decrease by 0.4% in 2024, while weather-normalized commercial sales volumes are projected to increase by 4.5%. The projected increase in commercial sales volumes is driven by new loads associated with data centers and cryptocurrency operations. Finally, AEP projects the industrial sales volumes to increase by 0.6% in 2024.\n(a)Percentage change for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(b)Forecasted percentage change for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nSupply Chain Disruption and Inflation\nThe Registrants have experienced certain supply chain disruptions driven by several factors including international tensions and the ramifications of regional conflict, increased demand due to the economic recovery from the pandemic, inflation, labor shortages in certain trades and shortages in the availability of certain raw materials. These supply chain disruptions have not had a material impact on the Registrants\u2019 net income, cash flows and financial condition, but have extended lead times for certain goods and services and have contributed to higher prices for fuel, materials, labor, equipment and other needed commodities. Management has implemented risk mitigation strategies in an attempt to mitigate the impacts of these supply chain disruptions.\nThe United States economy has experienced a significant level of inflation that has contributed to increased uncertainty in the outlook of near-term economic activity, including whether the pace of inflation will continue to moderate. A prolonged continuation or a further increase in the severity of supply chain and inflationary disruptions could result in additional increases in the cost of certain goods, services and cost of capital and further extend lead times which could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2023 SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS\nDisposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio\nIn February 2022, AEP management announced the initiation of a process to sell all or a portion of AEP Renewables\u2019 competitive contracted renewables portfolio (the portfolio) within the Generation & Marketing segment. In late January 2023, AEP received final bids from interested parties. In February 2023, AEP\u2019s Board of Directors approved management\u2019s plan to sell the portfolio and AEP signed an agreement with a nonaffiliated party.\nIn August 2023, AEP completed the sale of the entire portfolio to the nonaffiliated party and received cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, net of taxes and transaction costs. AEP recorded a pretax loss of approximately $93 million ($73 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the sale. See the \"Disposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio\" section of Note 7 for additional information.\nPlanned Sale of AEP Energy and AEP Onsite Partners\nAEP management has continued a strategic evaluation of AEP\u2019s portfolio of businesses with a focus on core regulated utility operations, risk mitigation and simplification. As a result of these efforts, the following decisions have been made with respect to AEP Energy and AEP Onsite Partners.\nAEP Energy\nIn October 2022, AEP initiated a strategic evaluation for its ownership in AEP Energy, a wholly-owned retail energy supplier that supplies electricity and/or natural gas on a price risk managed basis to residential, commercial and industrial customers. AEP Energy provides various energy solutions in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C. AEP Energy had approximately 929,000 customer accounts as of December 31, 2023. In April 2023, AEP management completed the strategic evaluation of AEP Energy and initiated a sales process. The timing of the completion of the sales process is dependent upon a number of factors. AEP is currently targeting the sales process to be completed in the first half of 2024. Depending on the outcome of the sales process, it could reduce future net income and impact financial condition.\nAEP Onsite Partners\nIn April 2023, AEP also made a decision to include AEP Onsite Partners in a sales process. AEP OnSite Partners targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions. As of December 31, 2023, AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 22 states, including approximately 195 MWs of installed solar capacity and two solar projects under construction totaling approximately 4 MWs. As of December 31, 2023, the net book value of these assets was $352 million. The timing of the completion of the sales process is dependent upon a number of factors. AEP is currently targeting the sales process to be completed in the first half of 2024. If AEP is unable to recover the net book value of these assets as part of the sale process, it could reduce future net income and impact financial condition.\nAEP Onsite Partners also owns a 50% interest in NMRD totaling $101 million accounted for as an equity method investment. The NMRD portfolio consists of 9 operating solar projects totaling 185 MWs and 6 projects totaling 440 MWs in development. Separate from the remainder of AEP Onsite Partners, AEP and the joint owner agreed to a joint sales process for their respective interests in NMRD.\nIn December 2023, AEP and the joint owner signed an agreement to sell NMRD to a nonaffiliated third party for $230 million. AEP expects to receive cash proceeds of $104 million, net of taxes, transaction fees and other customary closing adjustments. AEP recorded a pretax loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of entering into the sales agreement. The transaction has received all required regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024. See the \u201cNMRD\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nPlanned Sale and Strategic Evaluation of Certain Transmission Joint Ventures\nIn April 2023, AEP also initiated a strategic evaluation for its ownership in certain transmission joint ventures in the AEP Transmission Holdco segment including Pioneer Transmission, LLC, Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC and Transource Energy. In July 2023, AEP made a decision to initiate a sales process for its investment in Pioneer Transmission, LLC and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC. In February 2024, AEP management determined it would retain its ownership of its investment in Pioneer Transmission, LLC and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC. As of December 31, 2023, AEP\u2019s investment in Pioneer Transmission, LLC and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC was $46 million and $19 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net book value of Transource Energy was $289 million inclusive of $39 million related to noncontrolling interest on AEP\u2019s balance sheet. AEP management recently completed its strategic review and determined it would retain this business due to its fit within the goals and objectives of AEP and its overall leadership role in the U.S. electric transmission space.\nTermination of Planned Disposition of KPCo and KTCo\nIn October 2021, AEP entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) to sell KPCo and KTCo to Liberty Utilities Co., a subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (Liberty), for approximately a $2.85 billion enterprise value. The SPA was subsequently amended in September 2022 to reduce the purchase price to approximately $2.646 billion. An impairment of $363 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. The sale required approval from the KPSC and from the FERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. The SPA contained certain termination rights if the closing of the sale did not occur by April 26, 2023.\nIn May 2022, the KPSC approved the sale of KPCo to Liberty subject to certain conditions contingent upon the closing of the sale. In December 2022, the FERC issued an order denying, without prejudice, authorization of the proposed sale stating the applicants failed to demonstrate the proposed transaction will not have an adverse effect on rates. In February 2023, a new filing for approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act was submitted. In March 2023, the KPSC and other intervenors made filings recommending the FERC reject AEP and Liberty\u2019s new Section 203 application seeking approval of the sale.\nAs a result of delays in the anticipated timing of the closing of the transaction and other factors, AEP recorded a $363 million pretax loss on the expected sale of the Kentucky Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. In April 2023, AEP, AEPTCo and Liberty entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement (Termination Agreement) terminating the SPA. The parties entered into the Termination Agreement as all of the conditions precedent to closing the sale could not be satisfied prior to April 26, 2023. Upon termination of the sale and reverting to a held and used model, in the first quarter of 2023, AEP reversed $28 million of expected transaction costs included in the $363 million pretax loss and was required to present its investment in the Kentucky Operations at the lower of fair value or historical carrying value which resulted in a $335 million reduction recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment. The reduced investment in KPCo\u2019s assets is being amortized over the 30-year average useful life of the KPCo assets.\nRenewable Generation\nThe growth of AEP\u2019s regulated renewable generation portfolio reflects the company\u2019s strategy to diversify generation resources to provide clean energy to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs.\nSignificant Renewable Generation Placed Into Service\nIn 2023, AEP acquired and placed into service 159 MWs of owned renewable generation facilities totaling approximately $155 million.\nSignificant Approved Renewable Generation Filings\nAEP has received regulatory approvals from various state regulatory commissions to acquire approximately 2,811 MWs of owned renewable generation facilities, totaling approximately $6.6 billion, in addition to 377 MWs of renewable purchase power agreements, as included in the following table:\n(a)Includes approvals by the APSC and LPSC for 999 MWs of owned projects. Additionally, the LPSC approved the flex-up option, allowing SWEPCo to provide additional service to Louisiana customers and recover the portion of the projects denied by the PUCT.\nSignificant Renewable Generation Requests for Proposal (RFP)\nAs part of AEP\u2019s transition to diversify the company\u2019s regulated generation resources and build its renewable generation portfolio, RFPs have been issued in order to satisfy the need for additional capacity resources. The table below includes RFPs recently issued for both owned and purchased power generation. Unless otherwise noted, RFPs issued are all-source solicitations for accredited capacity with consideration made for renewable projects. Projects selected will be subject to regulatory approval.\n(a)RFP is seeking nameplate capacity proposals from various types of generation. Actual MWs by technology type depends on the portfolio of projects selected and individual contribution toward meeting I&M\u2019s overall capacity need.\n(b)RFP is seeking nameplate capacity proposals for up to 600 MWs of owned wind or solar and 200 MWs of wind or solar PPAs. Also includes an option for battery storage.\n(c)RFP is seeking proposals for PPAs only.\nRegulatory Matters - Utility Rates and Rate Proceedings\nThe Registrants are involved in rate cases and other proceedings with their regulatory commissions in order to establish fair and appropriate electric service rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. Depending on the outcomes, these rate cases and proceedings can have a material impact on results of operations, cash flows and possibly financial condition. AEP is currently involved in the following key proceedings.\nThe following tables show the Registrants\u2019 completed and pending base rate case proceedings in 2023. See Note 4 - Rate Matters for additional information.\nCompleted Base Rate Case Proceedings\n(a)See \u201c2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\nPending Base Rate Case Proceedings\nOther Significant Regulatory Matters\n2012 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk Plant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant\u2019s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo\u2019s recovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs. Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant\u2019s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap. In 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT\u2019s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the Texas Third Court of Appeals. In August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court judgment affirming the PUCT\u2019s order on AFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT\u2019s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap, and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. In November 2021, SWEPCo and the PUCT submitted Petitions for Review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October 2022, the Texas Supreme Court denied the Petitions for Review submitted by SWEPCo and the PUCT. In December 2022, SWEPCo and the PUCT filed requests for rehearing with the Texas Supreme Court. In June 2023, the Texas Supreme Court denied SWEPCo\u2019s request for rehearing and the case was remanded to the PUCT for future proceedings. In October 2023, SWEPCo filed testimony with the PUCT in the remanded proceeding recommending no refund or disallowance.\nOn December 14, 2023, the PUCT approved a preliminary order stating the PUCT will not address SWEPCo\u2019s request that would allow the PUCT to find cause to allow SWEPCo to exceed the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap in the current remand proceeding. As a result of the PUCT\u2019s approval of the preliminary order, SWEPCo believes it is probable the PUCT will disallow capitalized AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap and recorded a pretax, non-cash disallowance of $86 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Such determination may reduce SWEPCo\u2019s future revenues by approximately $15 million on an annual basis. On December 21, 2023, SWEPCo filed a motion with the PUCT for reconsideration of the preliminary order. In January 2024, the PUCT denied the motion for reconsideration of the preliminary order.\nThe PUCT\u2019s December 2023 approval of the preliminary order determined that it will address, in the ongoing PUCT remand proceeding, any potential revenue refunds to customers that may be required by future PUCT orders. In January 2024, the PUCT established a procedural schedule for the remand proceeding. Supplemental testimony from SWEPCo is due in March 2024, intervenor and staff testimony is due in April 2024 and a hearing is scheduled for May 2024. Although SWEPCo does not currently believe any refunds are probable of occurring, SWEPCo estimates it could be required to make customer refunds, including interest, ranging from $0 to $200 million related to revenues collected from February 2013 through December 2023.\nFERC 2021 PJM and SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge\nThe Registrants transitioned to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in its PJM and SPP transmission formula rates beginning with the 2022 projected transmission revenue requirements and 2021 true-up to actual transmission revenue requirements and provided notice of this change in informational filings made with the FERC. Stand-alone treatment of the NOLCs for transmission formula rates increased the annual revenue requirements for years 2023, 2022 and 2021 by $60 million, $69 million and $78 million, respectively.\nIn March 2023 and May 2023, certain joint customers submitted a complaint and a formal challenge at the FERC related to the 2022 Annual Update of the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP, respectively. These challenges primarily relate to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in the transmission formula rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries. AEPSC, on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP, filed answers to the joint formal challenge and complaint with the FERC in the second quarter of 2023.\nIn January 2024, the FERC issued two orders, granting the joint customers\u2019 challenges related to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP. The FERC directed the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP to provide refunds with interest on all amounts collected for the 2021 rate year, and for such refunds to be reflected in the annual update for the next rate year. In February 2024, AEPSC on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP filed requests with the FERC that it grant rehearing and reverse findings in its January 2024 orders or establish hearing procedures to address outstanding factual issues.\nAs a result of the January 2024 FERC orders, the Registrants\u2019 2022 and 2023 income statements cumulatively reflect a provision for refund for the probable refund of all NOLC revenues included in transmission formula rates for years 2023, 2022 and 2021. The probable refunds to affiliated and nonaffiliated customers are reflected as Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets. Refunds probable to be received by affiliated companies, resulting in a reduction to affiliated transmission expense, were deferred as an increase to Regulatory Liabilities or a reduction to Regulatory Assets on\nthe balance sheets where management expects that refunds would be returned to retail customers through authorized retail jurisdiction rider mechanisms. The FERC directed cash refunds with interest related to the 2021 rate year to occur through the annual update for the next rate year, which will be invoiced by PJM and SPP primarily in 2025. The Registrants have not yet been directed to make cash refunds related to the 2022 or 2023 rate years.\nThe FERC's January 2024 orders reduced AEP and AEPTCo's 2023 pretax net income by approximately $76 million and $74 million, respectively. The impact of the FERC's orders on the pretax net income of AEP's remaining Registrant Subsidiaries was not material.\nKentucky Securitization Case\nIn conjunction with KPCo\u2019s June 2023 base rate case filing, KPCo requested to finance, through the issuance of securitization bonds, approximately $471 million of regulatory assets recorded as of June 2023 including: (a) $289 million of plant retirement costs, (b) $79 million of deferred storm costs related to 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 major storms, (c) $52 million of deferred purchased power expenses and (d) $51 million of under-recovered purchased power rider costs.\nIn January 2024, the KPSC issued a financing order approving KPCo\u2019s securitization request and concluding that costs requested for recovery were prudently incurred. The KPSC\u2019s financing order includes certain additional requirements related to securitization bond structuring, marketing, placement, and issuance that were not reflected in KPCo\u2019s proposal. As a result, in January 2024, KPCo filed a request for rehearing with the KPSC to clarify certain aspects of these additional requirements. In February 2024, the KPSC denied KPCo\u2019s rehearing requests. In accordance with Kentucky statutory requirements and the financing order, the issuance of the securitized bonds is subject to final review by the KPSC after bond pricing. KPCo expects to proceed with the securitized bond issuance process and to complete the securitization process in the second half of 2024, subject to market conditions. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nDeferred Fuel Costs\nIncreases in fuel and purchased power costs in excess of amounts included in fuel-related revenues has led to an increase in the under collection of fuel costs from customers in several jurisdictions in recent years. To help ease the burden on customers, certain state commissions have issued orders allowing recovery of these costs over periods exceeding the traditional jurisdictional FAC terms. The table below illustrates the current and noncurrent under-recovered fuel regulatory asset balances, by jurisdiction, impacted by these orders. If any of these deferred fuel costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. See Note 4 - Rate Matters and Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for additional information.\n(a)In September 2023, APCo submitted a filing with the Virginia SCC requesting to extend the previously authorized recovery period through October 2024 to October 2025. Interim Virginia FAC rates were implemented in November 2023. An order from the Virginia SCC is expected in the first quarter of 2024.\n(b)In January 2024, the WVPSC issued a final order which resulted in a December 2023 write-off of $222 million ($127 million attributable to APCo and $95 million attributable to WPCo) of under-recovered ENEC regulatory assets as of February 28, 2023. The order approved the recovery of $321 million ($174 million attributable to APCo and $147 million attributable to WPCo) of under-recovered ENEC regulatory assets as of February 28, 2023 over 10 years beginning September 1, 2024. The recovery of the remaining under-recovered ENEC regulatory assets as of December 31, 2023 will be addressed in APCo and WPCo\u2019s 2024 ENEC filing. In February 2024, the Companies filed briefs with the West Virginia Supreme Court to initiate an appeal of this order.\n(c)In September 2022, the Director of the Public Utility Division of the OCC approved a Fuel Cost Adjustment rate designed to collect a $402 million deferred fuel balance through December 2024. PSO\u2019s fuel and purchased power expenses are subject to an annual prudency review by the OCC.\n(d)In September 2023, the PUCT issued an order approving an unopposed settlement agreement that provides recovery of $81 million of Oxbow mine and Sabine related fuel costs through 2035.\nMerchant Portion of Turk Plant\nSWEPCo constructed the Turk Plant, a base load 600 MW (650 MW net maximum capacity) pulverized coal ultra-supercritical generating unit in Arkansas, which was placed in-service in December 2012 and is included in the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment. SWEPCo owns 73% (440 MWs/477 MWs) of the Turk Plant and operates the facility.\nApproximately 20% of SWEPCo\u2019s portion of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost-based rate recovery in Arkansas. This portion of the plant\u2019s output is being sold into the wholesale market. Approximately 80% of the Turk Plant investment is recovered under retail cost-based rate recovery in Texas, Louisiana and through SWEPCo\u2019s wholesale customers under FERC-approved rates. In November 2022, SWEPCo filed a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the APSC for approval to operate the Turk plant to serve Arkansas customers and recover the associated costs through a cost recovery rider. Cost-based recovery of the Turk Plant would aid SWEPCo\u2019s near-term capacity needs and support compliance with SPP\u2019s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin requirements. In April 2023, intervenors filed testimony recommending the APSC deny the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity on the basis that the Turk Plant is not the least cost alternative. In June 2023, SWEPCo filed rebuttal testimony with the APSC. In July 2023, additional intervenor testimony was filed with the APSC by the Attorney General of Arkansas and the APSC staff with recommendations consistent with the previously filed April 2023 intervenor testimony. A hearing was held in October 2023 and an order is expected in the first quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the net book value of the Turk Plant was $1.4 billion, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory. If SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its investment and expenses related to the Arkansas retail portion of the Turk Plant, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6)\nIn July 2019, HB 6, which offered incentives for power-generating facilities with zero or reduced carbon emissions, was signed into law by the Ohio Governor. HB 6 terminated energy efficiency programs as of December 31, 2020, including OPCo\u2019s shared savings revenues of $26 million annually and phased out renewable mandates after 2026. HB 6 also provided for continued recovery of existing renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis through 2032 and included a provision for continued recovery of OVEC costs through 2030 which is allocated to all electric distribution utility customers in Ohio on a non-bypassable basis. OPCo\u2019s Inter-Company Power Agreement for OVEC terminates in June 2040. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of the Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, Larry Householder, four other individuals, and Generation Now, an entity registered as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. Certain defendants in that case had previously plead guilty and, in March 2023, a federal jury convicted Larry Householder and another individual of participating in the racketeering conspiracy. In 2021, four AEP shareholders filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. See \u201cLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6\u201d section of Litigation below for additional information.\nIn March 2021, the Governor of Ohio signed legislation that, among other things, repealed the payments to the nonaffiliated owner of Ohio\u2019s nuclear power plants that were previously authorized under HB 6. The new legislation, House Bill 128, went into effect in May 2021 and leaves unchanged other provisions of HB 6 regarding energy efficiency programs, recovery of renewable energy costs and recovery of OVEC costs. To the extent that the law changes or OPCo is unable to recover the costs of renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis by the end of 2032, recover costs of OVEC after 2030 or incurs significant costs associated with the derivative actions, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nLITIGATION\nIn the ordinary course of business, AEP is involved in employment, commercial, environmental and regulatory litigation. Since it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, management cannot predict the eventual resolution, timing or amount of any loss, fine or penalty. Management assesses the probability of loss for each contingency and accrues a liability for cases that have a probable likelihood of loss if the loss can be estimated. Adverse results in these proceedings have the potential to reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. See Note 4 - Rate Matters and Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies for additional information.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts and OVEC\u2019s coal-fired generating units. OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. After AEP learned of the criminal allegations against the Ohio legislator and others relating to HB 6, AEP, with assistance from outside advisors, conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the passage of the bill. Management does not believe that AEP was involved in any wrongful conduct in connection with the passage of HB 6.\nIn August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws. In December 2021, the district court issued an opinion and order dismissing the securities litigation complaint with prejudice, determining that the complaint failed to plead any actionable misrepresentations or omissions. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling.\nIn January 2021, an AEP shareholder filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio purporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In February 2021, a second AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. In April 2021, a third AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and a fourth AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Nassau County. These derivative complaints allege the officers and directors made misrepresentations and omissions similar to those alleged in the putative securities class action lawsuit filed against AEP. The derivative complaints together assert claims for: (a) breach of fiduciary duty, (b) waste of corporate assets, (c) unjust enrichment, (d) breach of duty for insider trading and (e) contribution for violations of sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and seek monetary damages and changes to AEP\u2019s corporate governance and internal policies among other forms of relief. The court entered a scheduling order in the New York state court derivative action staying the case other than with respect to briefing the motion to dismiss. AEP filed substantive and forum-based motions to dismiss in April 2022. In June 2022, the Ohio state court entered an order continuing the stays of that case until the final resolution of the consolidated derivative actions pending in Ohio federal district court. In September 2022, the New York state court granted the forum-based motion to dismiss with prejudice and the plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the New York appellate court. In January 2023, the New York plaintiff filed a motion to intervene in the pending Ohio federal court action and withdrew his appeal in New York. The two derivative actions pending in federal district court in Ohio have been consolidated and the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed an amended complaint. AEP filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and subsequently filed a brief in opposition to the New York plaintiffs\u2019 motion to intervene in the consolidated action in Ohio. In March 2023, the federal district court issued an order granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denying the New York plaintiffs\u2019 motion to intervene. In April 2023, one of the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of the Ohio federal district court order dismissing the consolidated action and denying the intervention. The defendants will continue to defend against the claims. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn March 2021, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing a purported AEP shareholder. The litigation demand letter was directed to the Board of Directors of AEP (AEP Board) and contained factual allegations involving HB 6 that were generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The shareholder that sent the letter has since withdrawn the litigation demand, which is now terminated and of no further effect. In April 2023, AEP received a litigation demand from counsel representing the purported AEP shareholder who filed the dismissed derivative action in New York state court and unsuccessfully tried to intervene in the consolidated derivative actions in Ohio federal court. The litigation demand letter is directed to the AEP Board and contains factual allegations involving HB 6 that are generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The letter demands, among other things, that the AEP Board undertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations by certain current and former directors and officers, and that AEP commence a civil action for breaches of fiduciary duty and related claims against any individuals who allegedly\nharmed AEP. The AEP Board considered the 2023 litigation demand letter and formed a committee of the Board (the \u201cDemand Review Committee\u201d) to investigate, review, monitor and analyze the allegations in the letter and make a recommendation to the AEP Board regarding a reasonable and appropriate response to the same. The AEP Board will act in response to the letter as appropriate. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn May 2021, AEP received a subpoena from the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement seeking various documents, including documents relating to the passage of HB 6 and documents relating to AEP\u2019s policies and financial processes and controls. In August 2022, AEP received a second subpoena from the SEC seeking various additional documents relating to its ongoing investigation. AEP is cooperating fully with the SEC\u2019s investigation, which has included taking testimony from certain individuals and inquiries regarding Empowering Ohio\u2019s Economy, Inc., which is a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, and related disclosures. The SEC staff has advanced its discussions with certain parties involved in the investigation, including AEP, concerning the staff\u2019s intentions regarding potential claims under the securities laws. AEP and the SEC are engaged in discussions about a possible resolution of the SEC\u2019s investigation and potential claims under the securities laws. Any resolution or filed claims, the outcome of which cannot be predicted, may subject AEP to civil penalties and other remedial measures. Discussions are continuing and management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring, but management does not believe the results of this investigation or a possible resolution thereof will have a material impact on results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nClaims for Indemnification Made by Owners of the Gavin Power Station\nIn November 2022, the Federal EPA issued a final decision denying Gavin Power LLC\u2019s requested extension to allow a CCR surface impoundment at the Gavin Power Station to continue to receive CCR and non-CCR waste streams after April 11, 2021 until May 4, 2023 (the Gavin Denial). As part of the Gavin Denial, the Federal EPA made several assertions related to the CCR Rule (see \u201cCCR Rule\u201d section below for additional information), including an assertion that the closure of the 300 acre unlined fly ash reservoir (FAR) is noncompliant with the CCR Rule in multiple respects. The Gavin Power Station was formerly owned and operated by AEP and was sold to Gavin Power LLC and Lightstone Generation LLC in 2017. Pursuant to the PSA, AEP maintained responsibility to complete closure of the FAR in accordance with the closure plan approved by the Ohio EPA which was completed in July 2021. The PSA contains indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the owners of the Gavin Power Station have notified AEP they believe they are entitled to indemnification for any damages that may result from these claims, including any future enforcement or litigation resulting from any determinations of noncompliance by the Federal EPA with various aspects of the CCR Rule consistent with the Gavin Denial. The owners of the Gavin Power Station have also sought indemnification for landowner claims for property damage allegedly caused by modifications to the FAR. Management does not believe that the owners of the Gavin Power Station have any valid claim for indemnity or otherwise against AEP under the PSA. In addition, Gavin Power LLC, several AEP subsidiaries, and other parties have filed Petitions for Review of the Gavin Denial with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring. Gavin Power LLC has also filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging various violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and asserting that the Federal EPA, through its prior inaction, has waived and is estopped from raising certain objections raised in the Gavin Denial. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation.\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\nAEP has a substantial capital investment program and incurs additional operational costs to comply with environmental control requirements. Additional investments and operational changes will be made in response to existing and anticipated requirements to reduce emissions from fossil generation and in response to rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of coal combustion by-products, clean water and renewal permits for certain water discharges.\nAEP is engaged in litigation about environmental issues, was notified of potential responsibility for the clean-up of contaminated sites and incurred costs for disposal of SNF and future decommissioning of the nuclear units. Management is engaged in the development of possible future requirements including the items discussed below.\nAEP will seek recovery of expenditures for pollution control technologies and associated costs from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions. Environmental rules could result in accelerated depreciation, impairment of assets or regulatory disallowances. If AEP cannot recover the costs of environmental compliance, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nEnvironmental Controls Impact on the Generating Fleet\nThe rules and proposed environmental controls discussed below will have a material impact on AEP\u2019s operations. Management continues to evaluate the impact of these rules, project scope and technology available to achieve compliance. As of December 31, 2023, AEP owned generating capacity of approximately 23,300 MWs, of which approximately 10,700 MWs were coal-fired. Management continues to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on AEP\u2019s fossil\ngeneration fleet and to refine the cost estimates of complying with these rules and evaluate other impacts of the environmental proposals on fossil generation.\nThe cost estimates will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in finalizing proposed rules or revising certain existing requirements. The cost estimates will also change based on: (a) potential state rules that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired and replaced, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity, (g) compliance with the Federal EPA\u2019s revised coal combustion residual rules and (h) other factors.\nClean Air Act Requirements\nThe CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation\u2019s air quality and control sources of air emissions. The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements. The primary regulatory programs that continue to drive investments in AEP\u2019s existing generating units include: (a) periodic revisions to NAAQS and the development of SIPs to achieve more stringent standards, (b) implementation of the regional haze program by the states and the Federal EPA, (c) regulation of hazardous air pollutant emissions under MATS, (d) implementation and review of CSAPR and (e) the Federal EPA\u2019s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil generation under Section 111 of the CAA. Notable developments in significant CAA regulatory requirements affecting AEP\u2019s operations are discussed in the following sections.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe Federal EPA periodically reviews and revises the NAAQS for criteria pollutants under the CAA. Revisions tend to increase the stringency of the standards, which in turn may require AEP to make investments in pollution control equipment at existing generating units, or, since most units are already well controlled, to make changes in how units are dispatched and operated. In February 2024, the Federal EPA finalized a new more stringent annual primary PM2.5 standard.\nAreas with air quality that does not meet the new standard will be designated by the Federal EPA as \u201cnonattainment,\u201d which will trigger an obligation for states to revise their SIPs to obtain further emission reductions to ensure that the new standard will be met. Areas around some of AEP\u2019s generating facilities may be deemed nonattainment, which may subject those facilities to additional pollution controls or operational constraints. The nonattainment designations by the Federal EPA and the subsequent SIP revisions by the affected states will take some time to complete, therefore, it is too soon to predict how SIP requirements may impact AEP\u2019s operations. Management will continue to monitor the issue.\nRegional Haze\nThe Federal EPA issued a Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in 2005, which could require power plants and other facilities to install best available retrofit technology to address regional haze in federal parks and other protected areas. CAVR is implemented by the states, through SIPs, or by the Federal EPA, through FIPs. In 2017, the Federal EPA revised the rules governing submission of SIPs to implement the visibility programs. Petitions for review of the final rule revisions have been filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\nIn Texas, the Federal EPA disapproved portions of the Texas regional haze SIP and finalized a FIP that allows participation in the CSAPR ozone season program to satisfy the NOX regional haze obligations for electric generating units in Texas. Additionally, the Federal EPA finalized an intrastate SO2 emissions trading program based on CSAPR allowance allocations. Legal challenges to these various rulemakings are pending in both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation, although management supports the intrastate trading program as a compliance alternative to source-specific controls and has intervened in the litigation in support of the Federal EPA.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nCSAPR is a regional trading program that the Federal EPA began implementing in 2015, which was designed to address interstate transport of emissions that contribute significantly to non-attainment and interfere with maintenance of the 1997 ozone NAAQS and the 1997 and 2006 PM NAAQS in downwind states. CSAPR relies on SO2 and NOX allowances and individual state budgets to compel further emission reductions from electric utility generating units. Interstate trading of allowances is allowed on a restricted basis. The Federal EPA has revised, or updated, the CSAPR trading programs several times since they were established.\nIn January 2021, the Federal EPA finalized a revised CSAPR, which substantially reduced the ozone season NOX budgets for several states, including states where AEP operates, beginning in ozone season 2021. Management believes it can meet the\nrequirements of the rule in the near term, and is evaluating its compliance options for later years, when the budgets are further reduced.\nIn addition, in February 2023, the Federal EPA Administrator finalized the disapproval of interstate transport SIPs submitted by 19 states addressing the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. Disapproval of the SIPs provides the Federal EPA with authority to impose a FIP for those states, replacing the SIPs that were disapproved. In August 2023, a FIP went into effect that further revises the ozone season NOX budgets under the existing CSAPR program in states to which the FIP applies. The disapproval of SIPs and implementation of FIPs continues to be subject to extensive litigation. Management will continue to monitor the outcome of this litigation and any potential impact to operations.\nClimate Change, CO2 Regulation and Energy Policy\nIn May 2023, the Federal EPA proposed greenhouse gas standards and guidelines for new and existing fossil-fuel fired sources. The proposal relies heavily on carbon capture and sequestration and natural gas co-firing as means to reduce CO2 emissions from coal fired plants and hydrogen co-firing and carbon capture and sequestration to reduce CO2 emissions from gas turbines. Management is evaluating the proposed rule.\nWhile no federal regulatory requirements to reduce CO2 emissions are in place, AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO2 emissions from its generating fleet. AEP expects CO2 emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities. The majority of the states where AEP has generating facilities passed legislation establishing renewable energy, alternative energy and/or energy efficiency requirements that can assist in reducing carbon emissions.\nAEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs take into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The objective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers. Based on the output of the company\u2019s IRPs, in October 2022, AEP announced new intermediate and long-term CO2 emission reduction goals. AEP adjusted its near-term CO2 emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005 baseline, upgraded its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full Scope 1 emissions and accelerated its net-zero goal by five years to 2045 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. AEP\u2019s total Scope 1 GHG estimated emissions in 2023 were approximately 42.8 million metric tons, a 68% reduction according to the GHG Protocol, which excludes emission reductions that result from assets that have been sold, or a 72% reduction from AEP\u2019s 2005 Scope 1 GHG emissions (inclusive of emission reductions that result from plants that have been sold).\nAEP has made significant progress in reducing CO2 emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline over the long-term. AEP also expects Scope 1 GHG emissions to vary annually depending on the mix of its own generation and purchased power used to serve customers. AEP\u2019s ability to achieve these goals is dependent upon a number of factors including the ability to execute on renewable resource plans, evolving RTO requirements, constructive regulatory support, the advancement of carbon-free generation technologies, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential tariffs, carbon policy and regulation, operational performance of renewable generation and supply chain costs and constraints, all while continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers.\nExcessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations have led to the announcement of early plant closures and could force AEP to close additional coal-fired generation facilities earlier than their estimated useful life. If AEP is unable to recover the costs of its investments, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nMATS Rule\nIn April 2023, the Federal EPA issued a proposed rule that would revise the MATS for power plants. The proposed rule includes a more stringent standard for emissions of filterable PM for coal-fired electric generating units, as well as a new mercury standard for lignite-fired electric generating units. The proposed rule also requires the installation and operation of continuous emissions monitors for PM. Management is evaluating the impacts of the rule as proposed and will continue to monitor the rulemaking.\nCCR Rule\nThe Federal EPA\u2019s CCR rule regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of CCR, including fly ash and bottom ash created from coal-fired generating units and FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants. The rule applies to active and inactive CCR landfills and surface impoundments at facilities of active electric utility or independent power producers.\nIn 2020, the Federal EPA revised the CCR rule to include a requirement that unlined CCR storage ponds cease operations and initiate closure by April 11, 2021. The revised rule provides two options that allow facilities to extend the date by which they must cease receipt of coal ash and close the ponds.\nThe first option provides an extension to cease receipt of CCR no later than October 15, 2023 for most units, and October 15, 2024 for a narrow subset of units; however, the Federal EPA\u2019s grant of such an extension requires a satisfactory demonstration of the need for additional time to develop alternative ash disposal capacity and will be limited to the soonest timeframe technically feasible to cease receipt of CCR. Additionally, each request must undergo formal review, including public comments, and be approved by the Federal EPA. AEP filed applications for additional time to develop alternative disposal capacity at the various plants.\nIn January 2022, the Federal EPA proposed to deny several extension requests filed by the other utilities based on allegations that those utilities are not in compliance with the CCR Rule (the January Actions). In November 2022, the Federal EPA finalized one of these denials (the Gavin Denial, discussed above). The Federal EPA\u2019s allegations of noncompliance rely on new interpretations of the CCR Rule requirements. The January Actions of the Federal EPA and the Gavin Denial have been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as unlawful rulemaking that revises the existing CCR Rule requirements without proper notice and without opportunity for comment. Management is unable to predict the outcome of that litigation or how it may impact the Federal EPA\u2019s interpretation of the CCR Rule.\nIn July 2022, the Federal EPA proposed conditional approval of the pending extension request for APCo\u2019s Mountaineer Plant. The Federal EPA alleged that the Mountaineer Plant was not fully compliant with the CCR Rule. In December 2022, AEP withdrew the pending extension request for the Mountaineer Plant as work to construct new CCR disposal facilities was completed and the extension was no longer needed. In addition, AEP ceased receiving ash in the other ponds subject to the extension requests, completed construction of new, CCR Rule compliant facilities and withdrew all of the remaining applications for additional time to develop alternative disposal capacity.\nUnder the second option for obtaining an extension of the April 11, 2021 deadline to cease operation of unlined impoundments, a generating facility may continue operating its existing impoundments without developing alternative CCR disposal, provided the facility commits to cease combustion of coal by a date certain. Under this option, a generating facility had until October 17, 2023 to cease coal-fired operations and to close CCR storage ponds 40 acres or less in size, or through October 17, 2028 for facilities with CCR storage ponds greater than 40 acres in size. Pursuant to this option, AEP informed the Federal EPA of its intent to retire the Pirkey Plant and cease using coal at the Welsh Plant. In March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. To date, the Federal EPA has not taken any action on the pending extension request for the Welsh Plant.\nClosure and post-closure estimated costs have been included in ARO in accordance with the requirements in the Federal EPA\u2019s final CCR rule. Additional ARO revisions will occur on a site-by-site basis if groundwater monitoring activities conclude that corrective actions are required to mitigate groundwater impacts. AEP may incur significant additional costs complying with the Federal EPA\u2019s CCR Rule, including costs to upgrade or close and replace surface impoundments and landfills used to manage CCR and to conduct any required remedial actions including removal of coal ash. If additional costs are incurred and AEP is unable to obtain cost recovery, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Management will continue to participate in rulemaking activities and make adjustments based on new federal and state requirements affecting its ash disposal units.\nIn May 2023, the Federal EPA proposed revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at inactive facilities (\u201clegacy CCR surface impoundments\u201d) as well as to establish requirements for currently exempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land (\u201cCCR management units\u201d). The Federal EPA is proposing that owners and operators of legacy surface impoundments comply with all of the existing CCR Rule requirements applicable to inactive CCR surface impoundments at active facilities, except for the location restrictions and liner design criteria. The proposal establishes accelerated compliance deadlines for legacy surface impoundments to meet regulatory requirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within one year after the effective date of the final rule. The Federal EPA's proposal would require evaluations to be completed at both active facilities and inactive facilities with one or more legacy surface impoundments. If finalized, AEP may incur material, additional costs complying with the Federal EPA\u2019s proposal, including costs to upgrade or close and replace legacy CCR surface impoundments and to conduct any required remedial actions including removal of coal ash. In addition, AEP would need to seek cost recovery through regulated rates, including proposing new regulatory mechanisms for cost recovery, for which regulatory approval cannot be assured. The proposed rule, if finalized, could have a material adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition if AEP cannot ultimately recover any additional costs of compliance.\nClean Water Act Regulations\nThe Federal EPA\u2019s ELG rule for generating facilities establishes limits for FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater, which are to be implemented through each facility\u2019s wastewater discharge permit. A revision to the ELG rule, published in October 2020, established additional options for reusing and discharging small volumes of bottom ash transport water, provided an exception for retiring units and extended the compliance deadline to a date as soon as possible beginning one year after the rule was published but no later than December 2025. Management has assessed technology additions and retrofits to comply with the rule and the impacts of the Federal EPA\u2019s actions on facilities\u2019 wastewater discharge permitting for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water. For affected facilities that must install additional technologies to meet the ELG rule limits, permit modifications were filed in January 2021 that reflect the outcome of that assessment. AEP continues to work with state agencies to finalize permit terms and conditions. Other facilities opted to file Notices of Planned Participation (NOPP), pursuant to which the facilities are not required to install additional controls to meet ELG limits provided they make commitments to cease coal combustion by a date certain. In March 2023, the Federal EPA proposed further revisions to the ELG rule which, if finalized, would establish a zero discharge standard for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water, and more stringent discharge limits for combustion residual leachate. Management is evaluating the impacts of the proposed rule to operations. Management cannot predict whether the Federal EPA will actually finalize further revisions, but will continue to monitor this issue and will participate in further rulemaking activities as they arise.\nThe definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d has been subject to rule making and litigation which has led to inconsistent scope among the states. Management will continue to monitor developments in rule making and litigation for any potential impact to operations.\nImpact of Environmental Regulation on Coal-Fired Generation\nCompliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits. Management continuously evaluates cost estimates of complying with these regulations which may result in a decision to retire coal-fired generating facilities earlier than their currently estimated useful lives.\nThe table below summarizes the net book value, as of December 31, 2023, of generating facilities retired or planned for early retirement in advance of the retirement date currently authorized for ratemaking purposes:\n(a)Net book value including CWIP excluding cost of removal and materials and supplies.\n(b)These amounts represent the amount of annual depreciation that has been collected from customers over the prior 12-month period.\n(c)Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2040.\n(d)Represents Arkansas and Texas jurisdictional share.\n(e)As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC granted SWEPCo regulatory asset treatment. SWEPCo will request recovery including a weighted average cost of capital carrying charge through a future proceeding. The Texas share of the Pirkey Plant will be addressed in SWEPCo\u2019s next base rate case. See the \u201cCoal-Fired Generation Plants\u201d section of Note 5 for additional information.\n(f)In November 2020, management announced it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028. Management is evaluating a potential conversion to natural gas after 2028 for both units.\n(g)Welsh Plant, Unit 1 is being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Welsh Plant, Unit 3 is being recovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\nManagement is seeking or will seek regulatory recovery, as necessary, for any net book value remaining when the plants are retired. To the extent the net book value of these generation assets is not deemed recoverable, it could materially reduce future net income, cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAEP\u2019s Reportable Segments\nAEP\u2019s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. AEP\u2019s reportable segments are as follows:\n\u2022Vertically Integrated Utilities\n\u2022Transmission and Distribution Utilities\n\u2022AEP Transmission Holdco\n\u2022Generation & Marketing\nThe remainder of AEP\u2019s activities are presented as Corporate and Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. See Note 9 - Business Segments for additional information on AEP\u2019s segments.\nThe following discussion of AEP\u2019s results of operations by operating segment provides a comparison of Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. For AEP\u2019s Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment and subsidiary registrants within these segments, the results include revenues from rate rider mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power and other recoverable expenses such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders.

Contracted Renewables Portfolio increased $93 million due to the pretax loss on the sale in 2023.\n\u2022Gain on Sale of Mineral Rights decreased $116 million due to the prior year sale of mineral rights.\n\u2022Depreciation and Amortization expenses decreased $50 million primarily due to the ceasing of depreciation on the competitive contracted renewables portfolio as a result of held for sale classification and subsequent sale in 2023.\n\u2022Interest and Investment Income increased $6 million primarily due to higher interest rates on advances to affiliates.\n\u2022Non-Service Cost Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost decreased $6 million primarily due to the elimination of loss amortization for the Qualified plan and an increase in the Qualified expected return on asset assumption from 5.25% for 2022 to 7.50% for 2023.\n\u2022Interest Expense increased $24 million primarily due to higher interest rates in 2023.\n\u2022Income Tax Benefit increased $40 million primarily due to:\n\u2022 A $74 million increase due to a decrease in pretax book income.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022A $19 million decrease due to the remeasurement of deferred state taxes.\n\u2022A $9 million decrease due to a decrease in tax credits.\n\u2022Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries increased $176 million primarily due to:\n\u2022A $182 million impairment of AEP\u2019s investment in Flat Ridge 2 Wind LLC in 2022.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022A $19 million impairment of AEP\u2019s investment in New Mexico Renewable Development joint venture in 2023.\n\u2022Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests increased $6 million primarily due to the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio in August 2023.\nCORPORATE AND OTHER\n2023 Compared to 2022\nEarnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders from Corporate and Other increased from a loss of $538 million in 2022 to a loss of $258 million in 2023 primarily due to:\n\u2022A $363 million pretax loss in 2022 related to the anticipated sale of the Kentucky Operations which was terminated in 2023.\n\u2022An $81 million increase in interest income, primarily due to higher interest rates on advances to affiliates.\n\u2022A $56 million decrease in corporate expenses, primarily due to adjustments driven by the termination of the sale of the Kentucky Operations.\n\u2022A $49 million increase in factoring revenues from the affiliates.\n\u2022A $30 million increase at EIS, primarily due to higher returns on investments.\n\u2022A $24 million increase due to asset impairments and other related charges in 2022.\nThese increases in earnings were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $286 million increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates and an increase in debt balances.\n\u2022A $46 million increase in Income Tax Expense primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $66 million increase due to the loss on the anticipated sale of the Kentucky Operations in 2022.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022A $15 million decrease due to favorable permanent tax adjustments in the current year and unfavorable permanent tax adjustments in 2022.\nAEP CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES\n2023 Compared to 2022\n\u2022Income Tax Expense increased $49 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $58 million increase in state tax expense primarily driven by consolidated tax adjustments and deferred state tax remeasurements.\n\u2022A $22 million decrease in amortization of Excess ADIT.\n\u2022A $22 million decrease in PTCs.\nThese increases in Income Tax Expense were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $36 million increase in amortization of deferred ITCs resulting from the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio.\n\u2022A $16 million decrease due to favorable permanent tax adjustments in the current year and unfavorable permanent tax adjustments in 2022.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAEP measures financial condition by the strength of its balance sheet and the liquidity provided by its cash flows.\nSIGNIFICANT CASH REQUIREMENTS\nAEP\u2019s contractual cash obligations include amounts reported on the balance sheets and other obligations disclosed in the footnotes. It is anticipated that these obligations will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, long-term debt issuances, short-term debt through AEP\u2019s Commercial Paper Program or bank term loans, proceeds from the sale of competitive contracted renewables and the use of the ATM Program or other equity issuances.\nCapital Expenditures\nContinued capital investments reflect AEP\u2019s commitment to enhance service and deliver reliable, clean energy and advanced technologies that exceed customer expectations. See \u201cBudgeted Capital Expenditures\u201d herein, for additional information.\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt maturities, including interest, represent a significant cash requirement for AEP and the Registrant Subsidiaries. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information relating to the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023, the weighted-average interest rate applicable to each debt category and a schedule of debt maturities over the next five years.\nOther Significant Cash Requirements\nOperating and finance leases represent a significant component of funding requirements for AEP and the Registrant Subsidiaries. See Note 13 - Leases for additional information.\nAEP subsidiaries have substantial commitments for fuel, energy and capacity contracts as part of the normal course of business. See Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP expected to make contributions to the pension plans totaling $7 million in 2024. Estimated contributions of $110 million in 2025 and $6 million in 2026 may vary significantly based on market returns, changes in actuarial assumptions and other factors. Based upon the projected benefit obligation and fair value of assets available to pay pension benefits, the pension plans were 99% funded as of December 31, 2023. See \u201cEstimated Future Benefit Payments and Contributions\u201d section of Note 8 for additional information.\nStandby letters of credit are entered into with third-parties. These letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs, security deposits and debt security reserves. There is no collateral held in relation to any guarantees in excess of the ownership percentages. In the event any letters of credit are drawn, there is no recourse to third-parties. See \u201cLetters of Credit\u201d section of Note 6 for additional information.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDebt and Equity Capitalization\nAEP\u2019s ratio of debt-to-total capital increased slightly from 62.9% to 63.0% as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily due to an increase in Long-term Debt to support distribution, transmission and renewable investment growth in addition to working capital needs. This was partially offset by the issuance of common equity in connection with the settlement of the forward equity purchase contracts related to the 2020 Equity Units and the utilization of cash proceeds received from the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio to reduce Short-term Debt.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining AEP\u2019s financial stability. Management believes AEP has adequate liquidity under its existing credit facilities. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had $5 billion in revolving credit facilities to support its commercial paper program. Additional liquidity is available from cash from operations and a receivables securitization agreement. Management is committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. AEP generally uses short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs, property acquisitions and construction until long-term funding is arranged. Sources of long-term funding include issuance of long-term debt, leasing agreements, hybrid securities or common stock. AEP and its utilities finance its operations with commercial paper and other variable rate instruments that are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. To the extent that there is an increase in interest rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nMarket volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP\u2019s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness. AEP is also monitoring the current bank environment and any impacts thereof. AEP was not materially impacted by these conditions during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn August 2023, AEP completed the sale of the entire Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio to a nonaffiliated party and received cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, net of taxes and transaction costs. The proceeds were used to pay down debt balances and support AEP\u2019s overall capital expenditure plans. See the \u201cDispositions\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nAEP continues to address the cash flow implications of increased fuel and purchased power costs, see \u201cDeferred Fuel Costs\u201d section of Executive Overview for additional information. In January 2024, AEP made a capital contribution to APCo and WPCo, totaling $100 million and $75 million, respectively. These contributions were made to help address the impact of the January 2024 WVPSC order that resulted in the December write-off of $222 million ($127 million attributable to APCo and $95 million attributable to WPCo) of under-recovered ENEC regulatory assets. See \u201cENEC (Expanded Net Energy Cost) Filings\u201d of Note 4 for additional information.\nNet Available Liquidity\nAEP manages liquidity by maintaining adequate external financing commitments. As of December 31, 2023, available liquidity was approximately $3.4 billion as illustrated in the table below:\nAEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries. The program funds a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP\u2019s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries; and the short-term debt requirements of subsidiaries that are not participating in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons, as direct borrowers. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2023 was $3.2 billion. The weighted-average interest rate for AEP\u2019s commercial paper during 2023 was 5.38%.\nOther Credit Facilities\nAn uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. As of December 31, 2023, AEP issued letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under six uncommitted facilities with a total capacity of $450 million. The Registrants\u2019 maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities, as of December 31, 2023, was $257 million with maturities ranging from January 2024 to November 2024.\nFinancing Plan\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP had $2.5 billion of long-term debt due within one year. This included $510 million of Pollution Control Bonds with mandatory tender dates and credit support for variable interest rates that requires the debt be classified as current and $205 million of securitization bonds and DCC Fuel notes. Management plans to refinance the majority of the maturities due within one year on a long-term basis.\nSecuritized Accounts Receivables\nAEP Credit\u2019s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of $900 million from bank conduits to purchase receivables. The agreement was amended in August 2023 to increase the commitment from $750 million and expires in September 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the affiliated utility subsidiaries were in compliance with all requirements under the agreement.\nDebt Covenants and Borrowing Limitations\nAEP\u2019s credit agreements contain certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in AEP\u2019s credit agreements. Debt as defined in the revolving credit agreement excludes securitization bonds and debt of AEP Credit. As of December 31, 2023, this contractually-defined percentage was 59.9%. Non-performance under these covenants could result in an event of default under these credit agreements. In addition, the acceleration of AEP\u2019s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of AEP\u2019s major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements. This condition also applies in a majority of AEP\u2019s non-exchange-traded commodity contracts and would similarly allow lenders and counterparties to declare the outstanding amounts payable. However, a default under AEP\u2019s non-exchange-traded commodity contracts would not cause an event of default under its credit agreements.\nThe revolving credit facilities do not permit the lenders to refuse a draw on any facility if a material adverse change occurs.\nUtility Money Pool borrowings and external borrowings may not exceed amounts authorized by regulatory orders and AEP manages its borrowings to stay within those authorized limits.\nATM Program\nAEP participates in an ATM offering program that allows AEP to issue, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1.7 billion of its common stock, including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to an equity forward sales agreement. There were no issuances under the ATM program for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $1.7 billion of equity is available for issuance under the ATM offering program. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\nEquity Units\nIn August 2020, AEP issued 17 million Equity Units initially in the form of corporate units, at a stated amount of $50 per unit, for a total stated amount of $850 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $833 million. Each corporate unit represents a 1/20 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of AEP\u2019s 1.30% Junior Subordinated Notes due in 2025 and a forward equity purchase contract which settled after three years in August 2023. The proceeds were used to support AEP\u2019s overall capital expenditure plans.\nIn June 2023, AEP successfully remarketed the Junior Subordinated Notes on behalf of holders of the corporate units. AEP did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing which were used to purchase a portfolio of treasury securities that matured on August 14, 2023. On August 15, 2023, the proceeds from the treasury portfolio were used to settle the forward equity purchase contract with AEP. The interest rate on the Junior Subordinated Notes was reset to 5.699% with the maturity remaining in 2025. In August 2023, AEP issued 10,048,668 shares of AEP common stock and received proceeds totaling $850 million under the settlement of the forward equity purchase contracts. AEP common stock held in treasury was used to settle the forward equity purchase contracts. The proceeds were used to pay down debt balances and support AEP\u2019s overall capital expenditure plans. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\nDividend Policy and Restrictions\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share in January 2024. Future dividends may vary depending upon AEP\u2019s profit levels, operating cash flow levels and capital requirements, as well as financial and other business conditions existing at the time. Parent\u2019s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends. Management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on its ability to access cash to meet the payment of dividends on its common stock. See \u201cDividend Restrictions\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information.\nCredit Ratings\nAEP and its utility subsidiaries do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit downgrade, but its access to the commercial paper market may depend on its credit ratings. In addition, downgrades in AEP\u2019s credit ratings by one of the rating agencies could increase its borrowing costs. Counterparty concerns about the credit quality of AEP or its utility subsidiaries could subject AEP to additional collateral demands under adequate assurance clauses under its derivative and non-derivative energy contracts.\nCASH FLOW\nAEP relies primarily on cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and investing activities. AEP\u2019s investing and capital requirements are primarily capital expenditures, repaying of long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. AEP uses short-term debt, including commercial paper, as a bridge to long-term debt financing. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows.\nOperating Activities\n(a)Includes Depreciation and Amortization, Rockport Plant, Unit 2 Lease Amortization, Deferred Income Taxes, Loss on the Expected Sale of the Kentucky Operations, Loss on the Sale of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio, Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges, Impairment of Equity Method Investment, Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction, Amortization of Nuclear Fuel, Gain on Sale of Mineral Rights and Establishment of 2017-2019 Virginia Triennial Review Regulatory Asset.\n(b)Includes Change in Regulatory Assets.\n2023 Compared to 2022\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities decreased by $276 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $547 million decrease in cash from Change in Other Noncurrent Assets primarily due to incremental other operation and maintenance storm restoration expenses incurred in several jurisdictions in addition to timing differences in collections from customers under rate rider mechanisms. See Note 4 - Rate Matters and Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for additional information.\n\u2022A $466 million decrease in cash from the Change in Certain Components of Working Capital. The decrease is primarily due to fuel, material and supplies driven by current year increases in coal inventory, the return of margin deposits from PJM in 2022 and the timing of accounts payable. These decreases were partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable.\n\u2022A $309 million decrease in cash from Changes in Other Noncurrent Liabilities. The decrease is primarily due to changes in provisions for refunds and regulatory liabilities driven by timing differences in refunds to customers under rate rider mechanisms in addition to an increase in ARO settlements in 2023. See Note 5 - Effects of Regulation and Note 18 - Property, Plant and Equipment for additional information.\n\u2022A $160 million decrease in cash from Net Income, after non-cash adjustments. See Results of Operations for further detail.\nThese decreases in cash were offset by:\n\u2022A $1.2 billion increase in cash primarily due to the timing of fuel and purchased power revenues and expenses. See the \u201cDeferred Fuel Costs\u201d section of Executive Overview for additional information.\nInvesting Activities\n2023 Compared to 2022\nNet Cash Flows Used for Investing Activities decreased by $1.5 billion primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $1.1 billion decrease due to the 2022 acquisition of Traverse, partially offset by the 2023 acquisition of the Rock Falls Wind Facility. See \u201cAcquisitions\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n\u2022A $1.1 billion increase in Proceeds from Sale of Assets, primarily due to the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio in 2023, partially offset by the sale of certain mineral rights in 2022. See \u201cDispositions\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\nThese decreases in cash used were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $707 million increase in Construction Expenditures, primarily due to increases in Vertically Integrated Utilities of $374 million and Transmission and Distribution Utilities of $290 million.\nFinancing Activities\n2023 Compared to 2022\nNet Cash Flows from Financing Activities decreased by $1.5 billion primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $2.8 billion decrease due to changes in short-term debt. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\n\u2022A $115 million decrease due to an increase in dividends paid on common stock.\nThese decreases in cash were partially offset by:\n\u2022An $813 million increase in issuances of long-term debt. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\n\u2022A $241 million increase due to a decrease in Principal Payments for Finance Lease Obligations primarily driven by Rockport Plant, Unit 2 final lease payments in 2022.\n\u2022A $173 million increase in issuances of common stock primarily due to the settlement of the 2020 equity units. See \u201cEquity Units\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information.\n\u2022A $149 million increase due to decreased retirements of long-term debt. See Note 14 - Financing Activities for additional information.\nThe following financing activities occurred during 2023:\nAEP Common Stock:\n\u2022During 2023, AEP issued 2.3 million shares of common stock under the incentive compensation, employee saving and dividend reinvestment plans. Additionally in 2023, AEP reissued 10 million shares of treasury stock to fulfill share commitments related to AEP\u2019s Equity Units. See \u201cCommon Stock\u201d and \u201cEquity Units\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information. AEP received net proceeds of $1 billion related to these issuances.\nDebt:\n\u2022During 2023, AEP issued approximately $5.5 billion of long-term debt, including $5.1 billion of senior unsecured notes at interest rates ranging from 5% to 7%, $296 million of other debt at various interest rates and $125 million of pollution control bonds at interest rates ranging from 4.25% to 4.7%. The proceeds from these issuances were primarily used to fund long-term debt maturities, construction programs and to help address working capital needs.\n\u2022During 2023, AEP entered into interest rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling $1.9 billion that were designated as cash flow hedges. During 2023, settlements of AEP\u2019s interest rate derivatives resulted in net cash paid of $44 million for derivatives designated as fair value hedges and net cash received of $20 million designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had a total notional amount of $950 million of outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges and $350 million designated as cash flow hedges.\nSee \u201cLong-term Debt Subsequent Events\u201d section of Note 14 for Long-term debt and other securities issued, retired and principal payments made after December 31, 2023 through February 26, 2024, the date that the 10-K was issued.\nBUDGETED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nManagement forecasts approximately $7.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2024. For the four year period, 2025 through 2028, management forecasts capital expenditures of $35 billion. The expenditures are generally for transmission, generation, distribution, regulated renewables and required environmental investment to comply with the Federal EPA rules. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain issues, weather, legal reviews, inflation and the ability to access capital. Management expects to fund these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and financing activities. Generally, the Registrant Subsidiaries use cash or short-term borrowings under the money pool to fund these expenditures until long-term funding is arranged. The estimated capital expenditures by Business Segment are as follows:\n(a)Amount primarily consists of facilities, software and telecommunications.\n(b)No capital expenditures expected based on the anticipated sale of AEP Energy and AEP Onsite Partners in 2024.\nThe 2024 estimated capital expenditures by Registrant Subsidiary are as follows:\n(a) Amount primarily consists of facilities, software and telecommunications.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including amounts related to legal matters and contingencies. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n\u2022It requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and\n\u2022Changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on net income or financial condition.\nManagement discusses the development and selection of critical accounting estimates as presented below with the Audit Committee of AEP\u2019s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee reviews the disclosures relating to them.\nManagement believes that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate. However, actual results can differ significantly from those estimates.\nThe sections that follow present information about critical accounting estimates, as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate.\nRegulatory Accounting\nNature of Estimates Required\nThe Registrants\u2019 financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated.\nThe Registrants recognize regulatory assets (deferred expenses to be recovered in the future) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) for the economic effects of regulation. Specifically, the timing of expense and income recognition is matched with regulated revenues. Liabilities are also recorded for refunds, or probable refunds, to customers that have not been made.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nWhen incurred costs are probable of recovery through regulated rates, regulatory assets are recorded on the balance sheets. Management reviews the probability of recovery at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur. Similarly, regulatory liabilities are recorded when a determination is made that a refund is probable or when ordered by a commission. Examples of new events that affect probability include changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation. The assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs as well as the return of revenues, rate of return earned on invested capital and timing and amount of assets to be recovered through regulated rates. If recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, that regulatory asset is written-off as a charge against earnings. A write-off of regulatory assets or establishment of a regulatory liability may also reduce future cash flows since there will be no recovery through regulated rates.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nA change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on net income. See Note 5 - Effects of Regulation for additional information related to regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues\nNature of Estimates Required\nAEP recognizes revenues from customers as the performance obligations of delivering energy to customers are satisfied. The determination of sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue accrual is recorded. This estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings. PSO and SWEPCo do not include the fuel portion in unbilled revenue in accordance with the applicable state commission regulatory treatment in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.\nAccrued unbilled revenues for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $288 million and $354 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP\u2019s Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $(66) million, $108 million and $(42) million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.\nAccrued unbilled revenues for the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment were $191 million and $221 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP\u2019s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment were $(30) million, $49 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric revenues are primarily due to changes in weather and rates.\nAccrued unbilled revenues for the Generation & Marketing segment were $111 million and $109 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in unbilled electric utility revenues for AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment were $2 million, $(1) million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nFor each Registrant except AEPTCo, the monthly estimate for unbilled revenues is based upon a primary computation of net generation (generation plus purchases less sales) less the current month\u2019s billed KWhs and estimated line losses, plus the prior month\u2019s unbilled KWhs. However, due to the potential for meter reading issues, meter drift and other anomalies, a secondary computation is made, based upon an allocation of billed KWhs to the current month and previous month, on a billing cycle-by-cycle basis, and by dividing the current month aggregated result by the billed KWhs. The two methodologies are evaluated to confirm that they are not statistically different.\nFor AEP\u2019s Generation & Marketing segment, management calculates unbilled revenues based on a primary computation of load as provided by PJM less the current month\u2019s billed KWhs and estimated line losses, plus the prior month\u2019s unbilled KWhs. However, due to the potential for meter reading issues, meter drift and other anomalies, a secondary computation is made, based upon using the most recent historic daily activity on a per contract basis. The two methodologies are evaluated to confirm that they are not statistically different.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nIf the two methodologies used to estimate unbilled revenue are statistically different, a limiter adjustment is made to bring the primary computation within one standard deviation of the secondary computation. Additionally, significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period, weather, line losses or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the estimate of unbilled revenue.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nNature of Estimates Required\nManagement considers fair value techniques, valuation adjustments related to credit and liquidity and judgments related to the probability of forecasted transactions occurring within the specified time period to be critical accounting estimates. These estimates are considered significant because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nThe Registrants measure the fair values of derivative instruments and hedge instruments accounted for using MTM accounting based primarily on exchange prices and broker quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, the fair value is estimated based on the best market information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes and other assumptions. Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. These uncertainties include forward market price assumptions.\nThe Registrants reduce fair values by estimated valuation adjustments for items such as discounting, liquidity and credit quality. Liquidity adjustments are calculated by utilizing bid/ask spreads to estimate the potential fair value impact of liquidating open positions over a reasonable period of time. Credit adjustments on risk management contracts are calculated using estimated default probabilities and recovery rates relative to the counterparties or counterparties with similar credit profiles and contractual netting agreements.\nWith respect to hedge accounting, management assesses hedge effectiveness and evaluates a forecasted transaction\u2019s probability of occurrence within the specified time period as provided in the original hedge documentation.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nThere is inherent risk in valuation modeling given the complexity and volatility of energy markets. Therefore, it is possible that results in future periods may be materially different as contracts settle.\nThe probability that hedged forecasted transactions will not occur by the end of the specified time period could change operating results by requiring amounts currently classified in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to be classified into Operating Income.\nFor additional information see Note 10 - Derivatives and Hedging and Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements. See \u201cFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1 for AEP\u2019s fair value calculation policy.\nLong-Lived Assets\nNature of Estimates Required\nIn accordance with the requirements of \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d accounting guidance and \u201cRegulated Operations\u201d accounting guidance, the Registrants evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstance include planned abandonments, probable disallowances for rate-making purposes of assets determined to be recently completed plant and assets that meet the held-for-sale criteria. The Registrants utilize a group composite method of depreciation to estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets.\nAn impairment evaluation of a long-lived, held and used asset may result from an abandonment, significant decreases in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as other economic or operations analyses. If the book value of the asset is not recoverable through estimated, future undiscounted cash flows, the Registrants record an impairment to the extent that the fair value of the asset is less than its book value. Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the non-discounted and discounted future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value, in some instances) associated with the asset. Assets held for sale must be measured at the lower of the book value or fair value less cost to sell. An impairment is recognized if an asset\u2019s fair value less costs to sell is less than its book value. Any impairment charge is recorded as a reduction to earnings.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nThe fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, the Registrants estimate fair value using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow projections or other market indicators of fair value such as bids received, comparable sales or independent appraisals. Cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made. Estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. Also, when measuring fair value, management evaluates the characteristics of the asset or liability to determine if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Such characteristics include, for example, the condition and location of the asset or restrictions on the use of the asset. The Registrants perform depreciation studies that include a review of any external factors that may affect the useful life to determine composite depreciation rates and related lives which are subject to periodic review by state regulatory commissions for regulated assets. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nIn connection with the evaluation of long-lived assets in accordance with the requirements of \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d accounting guidance, the fair value of the asset can vary if different estimates and assumptions are used in the applied valuation\ntechniques. Estimates for depreciation rates contemplate the history of interim capital replacements and the amount of salvage expected. In cases of impairment, the best estimate of fair value was made using valuation methods based on the most current information at that time. Differences in realized sales proceeds versus the estimated fair value of the asset are generally due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, differences in subsequent market conditions, the level of bidder interest, the timing and terms of the transactions and management\u2019s analysis of the benefits of the transaction.\nPension and OPEB\nAEPSC maintains a qualified, defined benefit pension plan (Qualified Plan), which covers substantially all nonunion and certain union employees, and unfunded, non-qualified supplemental plans (Nonqualified Plans) to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted under the provisions of the tax law for participants in the Qualified Plan (collectively the Pension Plans). AEPSC also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Pension Plans and OPEB plans are collectively referred to as the Plans.\nFor a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy, see \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d and \u201cFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities\u201d sections of Note 1. See Note 8 - Benefit Plans for information regarding costs and assumptions for the Plans.\nThe following table shows the net periodic cost (credit) of the Plans:\nYears Ended December 31,\nNet Periodic Cost (Credit) 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nPension Plans $ (24.3) $ 80.9 $ 138.2\nOPEB (107.1) (144.8) (122.0)\nThe net periodic benefit cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on the Plans\u2019 assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for 2024, management evaluated input from actuaries and investment consultants, including their reviews of asset class return expectations as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Management also considered historical returns of the investment markets and tax rates which affect a portion of the OPEB plans\u2019 assets. Management anticipates that the investment managers employed for the Plans will invest the assets to generate future returns averaging 7.25% for the Qualified Plan and 6.75% for the OPEB plans.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on the Plans\u2019 assets is based on management\u2019s targeted asset allocation and expected investment returns for each investment category. Assumptions for the Plans are summarized in the following table:\nManagement regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the investments to the targeted allocation. Management believes that 7.25% for the Qualified Plan and 6.75% for the OPEB plans are reasonable estimates of the long-term rate of return on the Plans\u2019 assets. The Pension Plans\u2019 assets had an actual gain of 9.50% and a loss of 16.88% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The OPEB plans\u2019 assets had an actual gain of 15.48% and a loss of 19.53% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Management will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust the assumptions as necessary.\nAEP bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had cumulative gains of approximately $526 million for the Qualified Plan that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets. These unrecognized\nmarket-related net actuarial gains may result in decreases in the future pension costs depending on several factors, including whether such gains at each measurement date exceed the corridor in accordance with \u201cCompensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d accounting guidance.\nThe method used to determine the discount rate that AEP utilizes for determining future obligations is a duration-based method in which a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan liability. The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio is used as the discount rate for the plan. The discount rate as of December 31, 2023 under this method was 5.15% for the Qualified Plan, 5.2% for the Nonqualified Plans and 5.15% for the OPEB plans. Due to the effect of the unrecognized net actuarial losses and based on an expected rate of return, discount rates and various other assumptions, management estimates costs (credits) for the Pension Plans will approximate $(6) million, $39 million and $77 million in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Based on an expected rate of return discount rate and various other assumptions, management estimates OPEB plan credits will approximate $72 million, $60 million and $66 million in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Future actual costs will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the Plans. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results. The effects of a 50 basis point change to selective actuarial assumptions are included in the \u201cEffect if Different Assumptions Used\u201d section below.\nThe value of AEP\u2019s Pension Plans\u2019 assets is $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2022. During 2023, the Qualified Plan paid $361 million and the Nonqualified Plans paid $8 million in benefits to plan participants. The value of AEP\u2019s OPEB plans\u2019 assets increased to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 from $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 primarily due to positive investment returns. During 2023, the OPEB plans paid $138 million in benefits to plan participants.\nNature of Estimates Required\nAEPSC sponsors pension and OPEB plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. These benefits are accounted for under \u201cCompensation\u201d and \u201cPlan Accounting\u201d accounting guidance. The measurement of pension and OPEB obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions.\nAssumptions and Approach Used\nThe critical assumptions used in developing the required estimates includes discount rate, compensation increase rate, cash balance crediting rate, health care cost trend rate and expected return on plan assets. Other assumptions, such as retirement, mortality and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\nThe actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans of participants or higher or lower lump sum versus annuity payout elections by plan participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and OPEB expense recorded. If a 50 basis point change were to occur for the following assumptions, the approximate effect on the financial statements would be as follows:\nNA Not applicable.\nSIGNIFICANT TAX LEGISLATION\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed H.R. 5376 into law, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA. Most notably this budget reconciliation legislation creates a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income (Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax or CAMT), extends and increases the value of PTCs and ITCs, adds a nuclear and clean hydrogen PTC, an energy storage ITC and allows the sale or transfer of tax credits to third parties for cash.\nIn June 2023, the IRS issued temporary regulations related to the transfer of tax credits. In the third and fourth quarter of 2023, AEP, on behalf of PSO, SWEPCo and AEP Energy Supply, LLC, entered into transferability agreements with nonaffiliated parties to sell 2023 generated PTCs resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $102 million received in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an additional $76 million expected in early 2024. AEP expects to continue to explore the ability to efficiently monetize its tax credits through third party transferability agreements. See Note 12 - Income Taxes for additional information.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 2 - New Accounting Standards for information related to accounting standards.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risks\nThe Vertically Integrated Utilities segment is exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through transactions in power, coal, natural gas and marketing contracts. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.\nThe Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment is exposed to energy procurement risk and interest rate risk.\nThe Generation & Marketing segment conducts marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. This segment is exposed to certain market risks as a marketer of wholesale and retail electricity. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. In addition, the Generation & Marketing segment is also exposed to certain market risks as a power producer and through transactions in wholesale electricity, natural gas and marketing contracts.\nManagement employs risk management contracts including physical forward and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts. Management engages in risk management of power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business. As a result, AEP is subject to price risk. The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. AEPSC\u2019s market risk oversight staff independently monitors risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of the Regulated Risk Committee and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports regarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures. The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President Utilities, Senior Vice President of Regulated Commercial Operations, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk and Chief Risk Officer. The Competitive Risk Committee consists of AEPSC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk, Senior Vice President of Competitive Commercial Operations and Chief Risk Officer. When commercial activities exceed predetermined limits, positions are modified to reduce the risk to be within the limits unless specifically approved by the respective committee.\nThe following table summarizes the reasons for changes in total MTM value as compared to December 31, 2022:\n(a)Reflects fair value on primarily long-term structured contracts which are typically with customers that seek fixed pricing to limit their risk against fluctuating energy prices. The contract prices are valued against market curves associated with the delivery location and delivery term. A significant portion of the total volumetric position has been economically hedged.\n(b)Market fluctuations are attributable to various factors such as supply/demand, weather, etc.\n(c)Relates to the net gains (losses) of those contracts that are not reflected on the statements of income. These net gains (losses) are recorded as regulatory liabilities/assets or accounts payable on the balance sheet.\nSee Note 10 - Derivatives and Hedging and Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to risk management contracts. The following tables and discussion provide information on credit risk and market volatility risk.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is mitigated in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis.\nAEP has risk management contracts (includes non-derivative contracts) with numerous counterparties. Since open risk management contracts are valued based on changes in market prices of the related commodities, exposures change daily. As of December 31, 2023, credit exposure net of collateral to sub investment grade counterparties was approximately 7.2%, expressed in terms of net MTM assets, net receivables and the net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM (representing economic risk even though there may not be risk of accounting loss).\nAs of December 31, 2023, the following table approximates AEP\u2019s counterparty credit quality and exposure based on netting across commodities, instruments and legal entities where applicable:\nAll exposure in the table above relates to AEPSC and AEPEP as AEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of certain AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries and AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries.\nIn addition, AEP is exposed to credit risk related to participation in RTOs. For each of the RTOs in which AEP participates, this risk is generally determined based on the proportionate share of member gross activity over a specified period of time.\nValue at Risk (VaR) Associated with Risk Management Contracts\nManagement uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR, to measure AEP\u2019s commodity price risk in the risk management portfolio. The VaR is based on the variance-covariance method using historical prices to estimate volatilities and correlations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period. Based on this VaR analysis, as of December 31, 2023, a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows or financial condition.\nManagement calculates the VaR for both a trading and non-trading portfolio. The trading portfolio consists primarily of contracts related to energy trading and marketing activities. The non-trading portfolio consists primarily of economic hedges of generation and retail supply activities.\nThe following tables show the end, high, average and low market risk as measured by VaR for the periods indicated:\nVaR Model\nTrading Portfolio\nTwelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nEnd High Average Low End High Average Low\n(in millions) (in millions)\n$ 0.2 $ 0.9 $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.5 $ 4.5 $ 0.7 $ 0.1\nVaR Model\nNon-Trading Portfolio\nTwelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nEnd High Average Low End High Average Low\n(in millions) (in millions)\n$ 17.7 $ 32.7 $ 16.4 $ 6.1 $ 17.7 $ 76.9 $ 24.7 $ 6.7\nManagement back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements. Based on the assumed 95% confidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every 20 trading days.\nAs the VaR calculation captures recent price movements, management also performs regular stress testing of the trading portfolio to understand AEP\u2019s exposure to extreme price movements. A historical-based method is employed whereby the current trading portfolio is subjected to actual, observed price movements from the last several years in order to ascertain which historical price movements translated into the largest potential MTM loss. Management then researches the underlying positions, price movements and market events that created the most significant exposure and reports the findings to the Risk Executive Committee, Regulated Risk Committee or Competitive Risk Committee as appropriate.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAEP is exposed to interest rate market fluctuations in the normal course of business operations. Prior to 2022, interest rates remained at low levels and the Federal Reserve maintained the federal funds target range at 0.0% to 0.25% for much of 2021. However, during 2022, the Federal Reserve approved several rate increases for a cumulative total of 4.25% increase. During 2023, the Federal Reserve approved another four rate increases for a cumulative total of 1.0% rate increase. AEP has outstanding short and long-term debt which is subject to variable rates. AEP manages interest rate risk by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt, by entering into interest rate derivative instruments and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on AEP\u2019s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by $40 million, $47 million and $33 million, respectively.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nAmerican Electric Power Company, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $5.6 billion of deferred costs included in regulatory assets, $0.8 billion of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $8.2 billion of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reduction, $0.2 billion of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant evidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of probability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and liabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application of relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\nValuation of Level 3 Risk Management Commodity Contracts\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company employs risk management commodity contracts including physical and financial forward purchase and sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, over-the-counter swaps and options to accomplish its risk management strategies. Certain over-the-counter and bilaterally executed derivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. As disclosed by management, the fair value of these risk management commodity contracts is estimated based on the best market information available, including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, and other assumptions. Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment including forward market price assumptions. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. Management utilized such unobservable pricing inputs to value its Level 3 risk management commodity contract assets and liabilities, which totaled $294 million and $155 million, as of December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of Level 3 risk management commodity contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the commodity contracts; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the forward market price assumptions used in management's valuation models. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's valuation of the risk management commodity contracts, including controls over the assumptions used to value the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the fair value of the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models, evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions, and testing the data used by management in the valuation models. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2017.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (AEP) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. AEP\u2019s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of AEP\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management\u2019s assessment, management concluded AEP\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, AEP\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of AEP\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $315 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets, $64 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $1,261 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reduction, $15 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant evidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of probability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and liabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application of relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of AEP Texas Inc. and Subsidiaries (AEP Texas) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

in Revenues were as follows:\n\u2022Retail Revenues decreased $197 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $178 million decrease in fuel revenues primarily due to lower spot market energy prices.\n\u2022A $54 million decrease in rider revenues.\n\u2022A $45 million decrease in weather-related usage due to a 23% decrease in heating degree days and a 20% decrease in cooling degree days.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $64 million increase in weather-normalized margins in all retail classes, partially offset by the wholesale class.\n\u2022A $17 million increase due to a reduction in provision for refund, partially offset by lower wholesale true-ups.\n\u2022Off-system Sales increased $73 million primarily due to economic hedging activity and Rockport

activity.\n\u2022A $2 million decrease due to lower PJM rates for certain point-to-point transmission service resulting from a December 2022 FERC approved settlement agreement.\n\u2022 Other Revenues increased $11 million primarily due to an increase in sales of renewable energy credits.\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows:\n\u2022Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expenses decreased $124 million primarily due to lower spot market energy prices and a decrease in generation, partially offset by an increase in average cost of fuel.\n\u2022Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates decreased $61 million primarily due to a decrease in purchases from AEGCo driven by a decrease in demand for power from the Rockport Plant.\n\u2022Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased $53 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $34 million increase in Demand Side Management expenses.\n\u2022A $10 million increase in River Transportation Division and merchant operation expenses.\n\u2022A $9 million increase due to a decreased Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited distribution in 2023.\n\u2022An $8

the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Indiana Michigan Power Company and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in common shareholder\u2019s equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $421 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets, $136 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $2,076 million of net regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reduction, $23 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant evidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of probability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and liabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application of relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Indiana Michigan Power Company and Subsidiaries (I&M) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. I&M\u2019s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of I&M\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management\u2019s assessment, management concluded I&M\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThis annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, I&M\u2019s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that

follows:\n\u2022Purchased Electricity for Resale expenses decreased $149 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $129 million increase in deferrals of OVEC costs.\n\u2022A $69 million decrease due to lower auction volumes driven by decreased load, partially offset by higher prices.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $36 million increase in recoverable expenses due to creation, consumption and liquidation of renewable energy credits and recoverable renewable energy purchase agreement expenses.\n\u2022Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates expenses increased $77 million due to increased affiliated auction volumes driven by AEP Energy auctions won in June 2023.\n\u2022Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased $136 million primarily due to the

partially offset by:\n\u2022A $10 million decrease in employee-related expenses.\n\u2022Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased $22 million primarily due to a higher depreciable base, partially offset by a decrease in recoverable rider depreciable expenses.\n\u2022Interest Expense increased $11 million primarily due to an increase of $20 million driven by higher debt balances and interest rates, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million due to increased AFUDC base and rates.\n\u2022Income Tax Expense increased $10 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholder of\nOhio Power Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the

As of December 31, 2023, there were $455 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets, $24 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $1,004 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reduction, $57 million of which were pending final regulatory determination.

Testing of regulatory assets and liabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application of relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\nValuation of Level 3 Risk Management Commodity Contracts\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company employs risk management commodity contracts including physical and financial forward purchase and sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, over-the-counter swaps and options to accomplish its risk management strategies. Certain over-the-counter and bilaterally executed derivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. As disclosed by management, the fair value of these risk management commodity contracts is estimated based on the best market information available, including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, and other assumptions. Fair value estimates, based upon the best market information available, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment including forward market price assumptions. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. Management utilized such unobservable pricing inputs to value its Level 3 risk management commodity contract liabilities, which totaled $51 million, as of December 31, 2023.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of Level 3 risk management commodity contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the commodity contracts; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the forward market price assumptions used in management\u2019s valuation models. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s valuation of the risk management commodity contracts, including controls over the assumptions used to value the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the fair value of the Level 3 risk management commodity contracts, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models, evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions, and testing the data used by management in the valuation models. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the forward market price assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Ohio Power Company and Subsidiaries (OPCo) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company's financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. As of December 31, 2023, there were $641 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets, $89 million of which were pending final regulatory approval, and $766 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting potential refund or future rate reduction, $1 million of which were pending final regulatory determination. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred future revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates. Management reviews the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities at each balance sheet date and whenever new events occur, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in the ongoing evaluation of the recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities, and in applying guidance contained in rate orders and other relevant evidence; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's evaluation of new events, such as changes in the regulatory environment, issuance of regulatory commission orders, or passage of new legislation, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment of probability of future recovery for regulatory assets and refund of regulatory liabilities. Testing of regulatory assets and liabilities involved evaluating the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, application of relevant regulatory precedents, and other relevant evidence.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. PSO\u2019s internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of PSO\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management\u2019s assessment, management concluded PSO\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThis annual report does not include an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, PSO\u2019s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit PSO to provide only management\u2019s report in this annual report.\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF OKLAHOMA\nSTATEMENTS OF INCOME\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\n(in

Shareholder\n(in millions)\n(a)Includes firm wholesale sales to municipals and cooperatives.\nThe major components of the decrease in Revenues were as follows:\n\u2022Retail Revenues decreased $86 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $125 million decrease in fuel revenue primarily due to lower natural gas and spot market energy prices, partially offset by authorized fuel rate increases in Arkansas and Texas designed to recover previously under-recovered fuel regulatory asset balances.\n\u2022A $20 million decrease in weather-related usage due to a 37% decrease in heating degree days.\n\u2022An $11 million decrease in weather-normalized margins primarily in the residential class.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $70 million increase primarily due to base rate revenue increases in Louisiana and Arkansas and rider increases in all retail jurisdictions.\n\u2022Off-system Sales decreased $14 million primarily due to reduced Turk Plant merchant sales.\n\u2022Transmission Revenues decreased $7 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $13 million decrease due to a FERC order which denied stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in transmission formula rates.\n\u2022An $8 million decrease in transmission formula rate true-up activity.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022A $12 million increase in transmission investment.\nExpenses and Other and Income Tax Benefit changed between years as follows:\n\u2022Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expenses decreased $82 million primarily due to lower natural gas and spot market energy prices, partially offset by the current year amortization of under-recovered fuel regulatory assets due to authorized fuel rate increases in Arkansas and Texas.\n\u2022Other Operation and Maintenance expenses decreased $53 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $19 million decrease in transmission expenses primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $13 million decrease in transmission formula rate true-up activity and decreased third-party expenses.\n\u2022A $7 million decrease due to a FERC order which denied stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in transmission formula rates.\n\u2022An $11 million decrease due to pre-construction costs associated with various renewable projects.\n\u2022A $10 million decrease in administrative and general expenses primarily due to regulatory fees and employee-related expenses.\n\u2022A $9 million decrease due to a prior year charitable contribution to the AEP Foundation.\n\u2022Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges increased $86 million due to the probable disallowance of Turk Plant capitalized AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap as a result of the PUCT\u2019s December 2023 preliminary order in the 2012 Texas Base Rate Case.\n\u2022Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased $18 million primarily due to an increase in amortization of regulatory assets.\n\u2022Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased $8 million primarily due to increased property taxes driven by the investment in the NCWF.\n\u2022Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction increased $7 million primarily due to higher AFUDC equity rates and CWIP.\n\u2022Interest Expense increased $10 million primarily due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates.\n\u2022Income Tax Benefit increased $8 million primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $17 million increase due to a decrease in pretax book income.\n\u2022A $10 million increase

Board of Directors and Shareholder of\nSouthwestern Electric Power Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southwestern Electric Power Company and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

The following list indicates Registrants to which the notes apply. Specific disclosures within each note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\n1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nORGANIZATION\nThe Registrants engage in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power. The Registrant Subsidiaries that conduct most of these activities are regulated by the FERC under the Federal Power Act and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and maintain accounts in accordance with the FERC and other regulatory guidelines. Most of these companies are subject to further regulation with regard to rates and other matters by state regulatory commissions.\nAEP provides competitive electric and gas supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers in deregulated electricity markets and also provides energy management solutions throughout the United States, including energy efficiency services through its independent retail electric supplier.\nThe Registrants also engage in wholesale electricity, natural gas and other commodity marketing and risk management activities in the United States and provide various energy-related services. In addition, AEP operated competitive wind and solar farms prior to the sale of AEP Renewables\u2019 competitive contracted renewables portfolio in August 2023. I&M provides barging services to both affiliated and nonaffiliated companies.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRates and Service Regulation\nAEP\u2019s public utility subsidiaries\u2019 rates are regulated by the FERC and state regulatory commissions in the eleven state operating territories in which they operate. The FERC also regulates the Registrants\u2019 affiliated transactions, including AEPSC intercompany service billings which are generally at cost, under the 2005 Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act. The FERC also has jurisdiction over certain issuances and acquisitions of securities of the public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company. The state regulatory commissions also regulate certain intercompany transactions under various orders and affiliate statutes. Both the FERC and state regulatory commissions are permitted to review and audit the relevant books and records of companies within a public utility holding company system.\nThe FERC regulates wholesale power markets and wholesale power transactions. The Registrants\u2019 wholesale power transactions are generally market-based. Wholesale power transactions are cost-based regulated when a cost-based contract is negotiated and filed with the FERC or the FERC determines that the Registrants have \u201cmarket power\u201d in the region where the transaction occurs. Wholesale power supply contracts have been entered into with various municipalities and cooperatives that are FERC-regulated, cost-based contracts. These contracts are generally formula rate mechanisms, which are trued-up to actual costs annually.\nThe state regulatory commissions regulate all of the retail distribution operations and rates of the Registrants\u2019 retail public utility subsidiaries on a cost basis. The state regulatory commissions also regulate the retail generation/power supply operations and rates except in Ohio and the ERCOT region of Texas. For generation in Ohio, customers who have not switched to a CRES provider for generation pay market-based auction rates. In addition, all OPCo distribution customers continue to pay for certain legacy deferred generation-related costs through PUCO approved riders. In the ERCOT region of Texas, the generation/supply business is under customer choice and market pricing is conducted by REPs. AEP has one active REP in ERCOT. AEP\u2019s nonregulated subsidiaries enter into short and long-term wholesale transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in the ERCOT market.\nThe FERC also regulates the Registrants\u2019 wholesale transmission operations and rates. Retail transmission rates are based upon the FERC OATT rate when retail rates are unbundled in connection with restructuring. Retail transmission rates are based on formula rates included in the PJM OATT that are cost-based and are unbundled in Ohio for OPCo, in Virginia for APCo and in Michigan for I&M. AEP Texas\u2019 retail transmission rates in Texas are unbundled but the retail transmission rates are regulated, on a cost basis, by the PUCT. Bundled retail transmission rates are regulated, on a cost basis, by the state commissions. Transmission rates for AEPTCo\u2019s seven wholly-owned transmission subsidiaries within the AEP Transmission Holdco segment are based on formula rates included in the applicable RTO\u2019s OATT that are cost-based.\nIn West Virginia, APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis.\nIn addition, the FERC regulates the Operating Agreement, TA and TCA, all of which allocate shared system costs and revenues among the utility subsidiaries that are parties to each agreement. The FERC also regulates the PCA. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions for additional information.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nAEP\u2019s consolidated financial statements include its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs, of which AEP is the primary beneficiary. The consolidated financial statements for AEP Texas include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Transition Funding (a consolidated VIE) and Restoration Funding (a consolidated VIE). The consolidated financial statements for APCo include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding (a consolidated VIE). The consolidated financial statements for I&M include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and DCC Fuel (consolidated VIEs). The consolidated financial statements for SWEPCo include the Registrant Subsidiary, its wholly-owned subsidiary and Sabine (a consolidated VIE). Intercompany items are eliminated in consolidation.\nThe equity method of accounting is used for equity investments where the Registrants exercise significant influence but do not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are initially recorded at cost in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets. The proportionate share of the investee\u2019s equity earnings or losses is included in Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on the statements of income.\nAEP, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo have undivided ownership interests in generating units that are jointly-owned. The proportionate share of the operating costs associated with such facilities is included on the income statements and the assets and liabilities are reflected on the balance sheets. See Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments and Note 18 - Property, Plant and Equipment for additional information.\nAccounting for the Effects of Cost-Based Regulation\nThe Registrants\u2019 financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that result in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. In accordance with accounting guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations,\u201d regulatory assets (deferred expenses) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and by matching income with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment, unbilled electricity revenue, valuation of long-term energy contracts, the effects of regulation, long-lived asset recovery, storm costs, the effects of contingencies and certain assumptions made in accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. The estimates and assumptions used are based upon management\u2019s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and Cash Equivalents include temporary cash investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas and APCo)\nRestricted Cash primarily includes funds held by trustees for the payment of securitization bonds.\nReconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash reported within the balance sheets that sum to the total of the same amounts shown on the statement of cash flows:\nOther Temporary Investments (Applies to AEP)\nOther Temporary Investments primarily include marketable securities and investments by its protected cell of EIS. These securities have readily determinable fair values and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification or weighted-average cost method. See \u201cFair Value Measurements of Other Temporary Investments\u201d section of Note 11 for additional information.\nInventory\nFossil fuel inventories are carried at average cost with the exception of AGR, which carries these inventories at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Materials and supplies inventories are carried at average cost.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nCustomer accounts receivable primarily include receivables from wholesale and retail energy customers, receivables from energy contract counterparties related to risk management activities and customer receivables primarily related to other revenue-generating activities.\nRevenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations of delivering energy to customers are satisfied. To the extent that deliveries have occurred but a bill has not been issued, the Registrants accrue and recognize, as Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the balance sheets, an estimate of the revenues for energy delivered since the last billing.\nAEP Credit factors accounts receivable on a daily basis, excluding receivables from risk management activities, through purchase agreements with I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and a portion of APCo. Since APCo does not have regulatory authority to sell accounts receivable in its West Virginia regulatory jurisdiction, only a portion of APCo\u2019s accounts receivable are sold to AEP Credit. AEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits. Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from bank conduits for a portion of its interests in the billed and unbilled receivables acquired from the affiliated utility subsidiaries. See \u201cSecuritized Accounts Receivable - AEP Credit\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information.\nGenerally, AEP Credit recognizes bad debt expense based upon a 12-month rolling average of bad debt write-offs in proportion to gross accounts receivable purchased from participating AEP subsidiaries. The assessment is performed separately for each participating AEP subsidiary, which inherently contemplates any differences in geographical risk characteristics for the allowance for uncollectible accounts. From January 2022 through August 2023, KPCo ceased selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit due to the planned sale of KPCo to Liberty. During this time period, KPCo recognized an allowance for uncollectible accounts on its balance sheet for its accounts receivables using the same assessment methodology used for AEP Credit\u2019s receivables. In September 2023, KPCo resumed selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit, due to the termination of the sale to Liberty. For receivables related to APCo\u2019s West Virginia operations, the allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated based on a rolling two-year average write-off in proportion to gross accounts receivable.\nFor customer accounts receivables relating to risk management activities, accounts receivable are reviewed for potential credit losses at a specific counterparty level basis. For AEP Texas, allowances for uncollectible accounts are calculated using the specific identification of receivable balances greater than 120 days delinquent, and for those balances less than 120 days where the collection is doubtful. For miscellaneous accounts receivable, bad debt expense is recognized based upon a 12-month rolling average of bad debt write-offs in proportion to gross accounts receivable, unless specifically identified.\nIn addition to these processes, management contemplates available current information, as well as any reasonable and supportable forecast information, to determine if allowances for uncollectible accounts should be further adjusted in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cCredit Losses.\u201d Management\u2019s assessments contemplate expected losses over the life of the accounts receivable.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries)\nAPCo, I&M, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo do not have any significant customers that comprise 10% or more of their operating revenues. AEP Texas had significant customers which account for the following percentages of Total Revenues for the years ended December 31 and Accounts Receivable - Customers as of December 31:\nSignificant Customers of AEP Texas:\nNRG Energy and TXU Energy 2023 2022 2021\nPercentage of Total Revenues 41 % 45 % 43 %\nPercentage of Accounts Receivable - Customers 34 % 42 % 41 %\nAEPTCo had significant transactions with AEP Subsidiaries which on a combined basis account for the following percentages of Total Revenues for the years ended December 31 and Total Accounts Receivable as of December 31:\nSignificant Customers of AEPTCo:\nAEP Subsidiaries 2023 2022 2021\nPercentage of Total Revenues 79 % 79 % 79 %\nPercentage of Total Accounts Receivable 60 % 72 % 81 %\nThe Registrant Subsidiaries monitor credit levels and the financial condition of their customers on a continuous basis to minimize credit risk. The regulatory commissions allow recovery in rates for a reasonable level of bad debt costs. Management believes adequate provisions for credit loss have been made in the accompanying Registrant Subsidiary financial statements.\nRenewable Energy Credits (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nIn regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants record renewable energy credits (RECs) at cost. For AEP\u2019s competitive generation business, management records RECs at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Registrants follow the inventory model for these RECs. RECs expected to be consumed within one year are reported in Materials and Supplies on the balance sheets. RECs with expected consumption beyond one year are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets. The purchases and sales of RECs are reported in the Operating Activities section of the statements of cash flows. RECs that are consumed to meet applicable state renewable portfolio standards are recorded in Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation at an average cost on the statements of income. The net margin on sales of RECs affects the determination of deferred fuel and REC costs.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nRegulated\nElectric utility property, plant and equipment for rate-regulated operations are stated at original cost. Additions, major replacements and betterments are added to the plant accounts. Under the group composite method of depreciation, continuous interim routine replacements of items such as boiler tubes, pumps, motors, etc. result in original cost retirements, less salvage, being charged to accumulated depreciation. The group composite method of depreciation assumes that on average, asset components are retired at the end of their useful lives and thus there is no gain or loss. The equipment in each primary electric plant account is identified as a separate group. The depreciation rates that are established take into account the past history of interim capital replacements and the amount of removal cost incurred and salvage received. These rates and the related lives are subject to periodic review. Removal costs accrued are typically recorded as regulatory liabilities when the revenue received for removal costs accrued exceeds actual removal costs incurred. The asset removal costs liability is relieved as removal costs are incurred. A regulatory asset balance will occur if actual removal costs incurred exceed accumulated removal costs accrued.\nThe costs of labor, materials and overhead incurred to operate and maintain plant and equipment are included in operating expenses.\nNuclear fuel, including nuclear fuel in the fabrication phase, is included in Other Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets.\nLong-lived assets are required to be tested for impairment when it is determined that the carrying value of the assets may no longer be recoverable or when the assets meet the held-for-sale criteria under the accounting guidance for \u201cImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\u201d When it becomes probable that an asset in-service or an asset under construction will be abandoned and regulatory cost recovery has been disallowed or is not probable, the cost of that asset shall be written down to its then current estimated fair value, with the change charged to expense, and the asset is removed from plant-in-service or CWIP. The fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, as opposed to a forced or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow analysis and appraisals.\nNonregulated\nNonregulated operations generally follow the policies of rate-regulated operations listed above but with the following exceptions. Property, plant and equipment of nonregulated operations are stated at original cost (or as adjusted for any applicable impairments) plus the original cost of property acquired or constructed since the acquisition, less disposals. Normal and routine retirements from the plant accounts, net of salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation for most nonregulated operations under the group composite method of depreciation. A gain or loss would be recorded if the retirement is not considered an interim routine replacement. Removal costs are charged to expense.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalization\nFor regulated operations, AFUDC represents the estimated cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction projects that is capitalized and recovered through depreciation over the service life of regulated electric utility plant. The Registrants record the equity component of AFUDC in Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction and the debt component of AFUDC as a reduction to Interest Expense on the statements of income. For nonregulated operations, including certain generating assets, interest is capitalized during construction in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cCapitalization of Interest.\u201d\nAsset Retirement Obligations (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants record ARO in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cAsset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\u201d for legal obligations for asbestos removal and for the retirement of certain ash disposal facilities, wind farms, solar farms and certain coal-mining facilities. I&M records ARO for the decommissioning of the Cook Plant. AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs associated with the future retirement of an asset and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be decommissioned, inflation, and discount rate, which may change significantly over time. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The Registrants have identified, but not recognized, ARO liabilities related to electric transmission and distribution assets as a result of certain easements on property on which assets are owned. Generally, such easements are perpetual and require only the retirement and removal of assets upon the cessation of the property\u2019s use. The retirement obligation is not estimable for such easements since the Registrants plan to use their facilities indefinitely. The retirement obligation would only be recognized if and when the Registrants abandon or cease the use of specific easements, which is not expected.\nValuation of Nonderivative Financial Instruments\nThe book values of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Advances to/from Affiliates, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Short-term Debt approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe accounting guidance for \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. When quoted market prices are not available, pricing may be completed using comparable securities, dealer values, operating data and general market conditions to determine fair value. Valuation models utilize various inputs such as commodity, interest rate and, to a lesser degree, volatility and credit that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, market corroborated inputs (i.e. inputs derived principally from, or correlated to, observable market data) and other observable inputs for the asset or liability.\nFor commercial activities, exchange-traded derivatives, namely futures contracts, are generally fair valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1. Level 2 inputs primarily consist of OTC broker quotes in moderately active or less active markets, as well as exchange-traded derivatives where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1. Management verifies price curves using these broker quotes and classifies these fair values within Level 2 when substantially all of the fair value can be corroborated. Management typically obtains multiple broker quotes, which are nonbinding in nature but are based on recent trades in the marketplace. When multiple broker quotes are obtained, the quoted bid and ask prices are averaged. In certain circumstances, a broker quote may be discarded if it is a clear outlier. Management uses a historical correlation analysis between the broker quoted location and the illiquid locations. If the points are highly correlated, these locations are included within Level 2 as well. Certain OTC and bilaterally executed derivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information. Illiquid transactions, complex structured transactions, FTRs and counterparty credit risk may require nonmarket-based inputs. Some of these inputs may be internally developed or extrapolated and utilized to estimate fair value. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized as Level 3. The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market. A portion of the Level 3 instruments have been economically hedged which limits potential earnings volatility.\nAEP utilizes its trustee\u2019s external pricing service to estimate the fair value of the underlying investments held in the benefit plan and nuclear trusts. AEP\u2019s investment managers review and validate the prices utilized by the trustee to determine fair value. AEP\u2019s management performs its own valuation testing to verify the fair values of the securities. AEP receives audit reports of the trustee\u2019s operating controls and valuation processes.\nAssets in the benefits and nuclear trusts, cash and cash equivalents, other temporary investments and restricted cash for securitized funding are classified using the following methods. Equities are classified as Level 1 holdings if they are actively traded on exchanges. Items classified as Level 1 are investments in money market funds, fixed income and equity mutual funds and equity securities. They are valued based on observable inputs, primarily unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Items classified as Level 2 are primarily investments in individual fixed income securities. Fixed income securities generally do not trade on exchanges and do not have an official closing price but their valuation inputs are based on observable market data. Pricing vendors calculate bond valuations using financial models and matrices. The models use observable inputs including yields on benchmark securities, quotes by securities brokers, rating agency actions, discounts or premiums on securities compared to par prices, changes in yields for U.S. Treasury securities, corporate actions by bond issuers, prepayment schedules and histories, economic events and, for certain securities, adjustments to yields to reflect changes in the rate of inflation. Other securities with model-derived valuation inputs that are observable are also classified as Level 2 investments. Investments with unobservable valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 investments. Investments classified as Other are valued using Net Asset Value as a practical expedient. Items classified as Other are primarily cash equivalent funds, common collective trusts, commingled funds, structured products, private equity, real estate, infrastructure and alternative credit investments. These investments do not have a readily determinable fair value or they contain redemption restrictions which may include the right to suspend redemptions under certain circumstances. Redemption restrictions may also prevent certain investments from being redeemed at the reporting date for the underlying value.\nDeferred Fuel Costs (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nThe cost of purchased electricity, fuel and related emission allowances and emission control chemicals/consumables is charged to Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expense when the fuel is burned or the allowance or consumable is utilized. The cost of fuel also includes the cost of nuclear fuel burned which is computed primarily using the units-of-production method. In regulated jurisdictions with an active FAC, fuel cost over-recoveries (the excess of\nfuel-related revenues over applicable fuel costs incurred) are generally deferred as current regulatory liabilities and under-recoveries (the excess of applicable fuel costs incurred over fuel-related revenues) are generally deferred as current regulatory assets. Fuel cost over-recovery and under-recovery balances are classified as noncurrent when there is an expectation that refunds or recoveries will extend beyond a one year period, based on a company\u2019s filing with a commission or a commission directive. These deferrals are incorporated into the development of future fuel rates billed to or refunded to customers. The amount of an over-recovery or under-recovery can also be affected by actions of the state regulatory commissions. On a routine basis, state regulatory commissions review and/or audit the Registrants\u2019 fuel procurement policies and practices, the fuel cost calculations and FAC deferrals. FAC deferrals are adjusted when costs are no longer probable of recovery or when refunds of fuel reserves are probable. The Registrants share the majority of their Off-system Sales margins to customers either through an active FAC or other rate mechanisms. Where the FAC or Off-system Sales sharing mechanism is capped, frozen, non-existent or applicable to merchant operations, changes in fuel costs or sharing of Off-system Sales impact earnings.\nRevenue Recognition\nRegulatory Accounting\nThe Registrants\u2019 financial statements reflect the actions of regulators that can result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than enterprises that are not rate-regulated. Regulatory assets (deferred expenses or alternative revenues recognized in accordance with the guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations\u201d) and regulatory liabilities (deferred revenue reductions or refunds) are recorded to reflect the economic effects of regulation in the same accounting period by matching expenses with their recovery through regulated revenues and by matching revenue with its passage to customers in cost-based regulated rates.\nWhen regulatory assets are probable of recovery through regulated rates, assets are recorded on the balance sheets. Regulatory assets are reviewed for probability of recovery at each balance sheet date or whenever new events occur. Examples of new events include the issuance of a regulatory commission order or passage of new legislation. If it is determined that recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, the regulatory asset is derecognized as a charge against income.\nRetail and Wholesale Supply and Delivery of Electricity\nThe Registrants recognize revenues from customers for retail and wholesale electricity sales and electricity transmission and distribution delivery services. The Registrants recognize such revenues on the statements of income as the performance obligations of delivering energy to customers are satisfied. Recognized revenues include both billed and unbilled amounts. In accordance with the applicable state commission\u2019s regulatory treatment, PSO and SWEPCo do not include the fuel portion in unbilled revenue, but rather recognize such revenues when billed to customers.\nWholesale transmission revenue is based on FERC-approved formula rate filings made for each calendar year using estimated costs. Revenues initially recognized per the annual rate filing are compared to actual costs, resulting in the subsequent recognition of an over or under-recovered amount, with interest, that is refunded or recovered, respectively, in a future year\u2019s rates. These annual true-ups meet the definition of alternative revenues in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations\u201d. An estimated annual true-up is recorded by the Registrants in the fourth quarter of each calendar year and a final annual true-up is recognized by the Registrants in the second quarter of each calendar year following the filing of annual FERC reports. Any portion of the true-ups applicable to an affiliated company is recorded as Accounts Receivable - Affiliated Companies or Accounts Payable - Affiliated Companies on the balance sheets. Any portion of the true-ups applicable to third-parties is recorded as Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets. See Note 19 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information.\nGross versus Net Presentation of Certain Electricity Supply and Delivery Activities\nMost of the power produced at the generation plants is sold to PJM or SPP. The Registrants also purchase power from PJM and SPP to supply power to customers. Generally, these power sales and purchases are reported on a net basis as revenues on the statements of income. However, purchases of power in excess of sales to PJM or SPP, on an hourly net basis, used to serve retail load are recorded gross as Purchased Electricity on the statements of income. With the exception of certain dedicated load bilateral power supply contracts, the transactions of AEP\u2019s nonregulated subsidiaries are reported as gross purchases or sales.\nPhysical energy purchases arising from non-derivative contracts are accounted for on a gross basis in Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income. Energy purchases arising from non-trading derivative contracts are recorded based on the transaction\u2019s facts and circumstances. Certain derivatives that economically hedge future commodity risk are recorded in the same line item on the statements of income as that of the associated risk being hedged. Realized gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in Total Revenues or Purchased Electricity depending on the nature of the risk being hedged. Derivative purchases elected normal used to serve accrual based obligations are recorded in Purchased Electricity on the statements of income. All other non-trading derivative purchases are recorded net in revenues.\nIn general, the Registrants record expenses when purchased electricity is received and when expenses are incurred, with the exception of certain power purchase contracts that are derivatives and accounted for using MTM accounting where generation/supply rates are not cost-based regulated. In jurisdictions where the generation/supply business is subject to cost-based regulation, the unrealized MTM amounts are deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).\nEnergy Marketing and Risk Management Activities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants engage in power, capacity and, to a lesser extent, natural gas marketing as major power producers and participants in electricity and natural gas markets. The Registrants also engage in power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity risk management activities focused on markets where the AEP System owns assets and on adjacent markets. These activities include the purchase-and-sale of energy under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices. These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options. Certain energy marketing and risk management transactions are with RTOs.\nThe Registrants recognize revenues from marketing and risk management transactions that are not derivatives as the performance obligation of delivering the commodity is satisfied. Expenses from marketing and risk management transactions that are not derivatives are also recognized upon delivery of the commodity.\nThe Registrants use MTM accounting for marketing and risk management transactions that are derivatives unless the derivative is designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship or elected normal under the normal purchase normal sale election. Unrealized MTM gains and losses are included on the balance sheets as Risk Management Assets or Liabilities, as appropriate, and on the statements of income in Total Revenues. Realized gains and losses on marketing and risk management transactions are included in revenues or expenses based on the transaction\u2019s facts and circumstances. However, in regulated jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation, unrealized MTM amounts and some realized gains and losses are deferred as regulatory assets (for losses) and regulatory liabilities (for gains).\nCertain qualifying marketing and risk management derivatives transactions are designated as hedges of variability in future cash flows as a result of forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge). In the event the Registrants designate a cash flow hedge, the cash flow hedge\u2019s gain or loss is initially recorded as a component of AOCI. When the forecasted transaction is realized and affects net income, the Registrants subsequently reclassify the gain or loss on the hedge from AOCI into revenues or expenses within the same financial statement line item as the forecasted transaction on their statements of income. See \u201cAccounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies\u201d section of Note 10 for additional information.\nLevelization of Nuclear Refueling Outage Costs (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nIn accordance with regulatory orders, I&M defers incremental operation and maintenance costs associated with periodic refueling outages at its Cook Plant and amortizes the costs over approximately 18 months, beginning with the month following the start of each unit\u2019s refueling outage and lasting until the end of the month in which the same unit\u2019s next scheduled refueling outage begins.\nMaintenance\nThe Registrants expense maintenance costs as incurred. If it becomes probable that the Registrants will recover specifically-incurred costs through future rates, a regulatory asset is established to match the expensing of those maintenance costs with their recovery in cost-based regulated revenues. In certain regulated jurisdictions, the Registrants defer costs above the level included in base rates and amortize those deferrals commensurate with recovery through rate riders.\nIncome Taxes and Investment and Production Tax Credits\nThe Registrants use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities which will result in a future tax consequence. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nWhen the flow-through method of accounting for temporary differences is required by a regulator to be reflected in regulated revenues (that is, when deferred taxes are not included in the cost-of-service for determining regulated rates for electricity), deferred income taxes are recorded and related regulatory assets and liabilities are established to match the regulated revenues and tax expense.\nAEP and subsidiaries apply the deferral methodology for the recognition of ITCs. Deferred ITCs are amortized to income tax expense over the life of the asset that generated the credit. Amortization of deferred ITCs begins when the asset is placed in-service, except where regulatory commissions reflect ITCs in the rate-making process, then amortization begins when the utility is able to utilize the ITC on a stand-alone basis. Alternatively, PTCs reduce income tax expense as they are earned. PTCs are earned when electricity is produced.\nTransferable tax credits established by the IRA are accounted for in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d by the Registrants. Proceeds from sales of transferable tax credits are included as a component of Operating Activities on the statement of cash flows and presented as gross within the Supplementary Cash Flow Information.\nThe Registrants account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cIncome Taxes.\u201d The Registrants classify interest expense or income related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense or income as appropriate and classify penalties as Other Operation expense on the statements of income.\nAEP and subsidiaries join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. The benefit of current tax loss of the parent company (Parent Company Loss Benefit) to the AEP System subsidiaries is accounted for as an allocation through equity. The consolidated NOL of the AEP System is allocated to each company in the consolidated group with taxable loss. With the exception of the allocation of the consolidated AEP System NOL, the loss of the Parent and tax credits, the method of allocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group.\nExcise Taxes (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAs agents for some state and local governments, the Registrants collect from customers certain excise taxes levied by those state or local governments on customers. The Registrants do not record these taxes as revenue or expense.\nDebt\nGains and losses from the reacquisition of debt used to finance regulated electric utility plants are deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the reacquired debt in accordance with their rate-making treatment unless the debt is refinanced. If the reacquired debt associated with the regulated business is refinanced, the reacquisition costs attributable to the portions of the business that are subject to cost-based regulatory accounting are generally deferred and amortized over the term of the replacement debt consistent with its recovery in rates. Operations not subject to cost-based rate regulation report gains and losses on the reacquisition of debt in Interest Expense on the statements of income upon reacquisition.\nDebt discounts, premiums and debt issuance expenses are deferred and amortized generally utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related debt. The straight-line method approximates the effective interest method and is consistent with the treatment in rates for regulated operations. The net amortization expense is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nPension and OPEB Plans (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAEPSC sponsors a qualified pension plan and two unfunded non-qualified pension plans. Substantially all AEP subsidiary employees are covered by the qualified plan or both the qualified and a non-qualified pension plan. AEPSC also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Registrant Subsidiaries account for their participation in the AEPSC sponsored pension and OPEB plans using multiple-employer accounting. See Note 8 - Benefit Plans for additional information including significant accounting policies associated with the plans.\nInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nAEP has several trust funds with significant investments intended to provide for future payments of pension and OPEB benefits, nuclear decommissioning and SNF disposal. All of the trust funds\u2019 investments are diversified and managed in compliance with all laws and regulations. The investment strategy for the trust funds is to use a diversified portfolio of investments to achieve an acceptable rate of return while managing the investment risk of the assets relative to the associated liabilities. To minimize investment risk, the trust funds are broadly diversified among classes of assets, investment strategies and investment managers. Management regularly reviews the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalances the investments to targeted allocations when appropriate. Investment policies and guidelines allow investment managers in approved strategies to use financial derivatives to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities. The investments are reported at fair value under the \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d accounting guidance.\nBenefit Plans\nAll benefit plan assets are invested in accordance with each plan\u2019s investment policy. The investment policy outlines the investment objectives, strategies and target asset allocations by plan.\nThe investment philosophies for AEP\u2019s benefit plans support the allocation of assets to minimize risks and optimize net returns. Strategies used include:\n\u2022Maintaining a long-term investment horizon.\n\u2022Diversifying assets to help control volatility of returns at acceptable levels.\n\u2022Managing fees, transaction costs and tax liabilities to maximize investment earnings.\n\u2022Using active management of investments where appropriate risk/return opportunities exist.\n\u2022Keeping portfolio structure style-neutral to limit volatility compared to applicable benchmarks.\n\u2022Using alternative asset classes such as real estate and private equity to maximize return and provide additional portfolio diversification.\nThe objective of the investment policy for the pension fund is to maintain the funded status of the plan while providing for growth in the plan assets to offset the growth in the plan liabilities. The current target asset allocations are as follows:\nThe investment policy for each benefit plan contains various investment limitations. The investment policies establish concentration limits for securities and prohibit the purchase of securities issued by AEP (with the exception of proportionate and immaterial holdings of AEP securities in passive index strategies or certain commingled funds). However, the investment policies do not preclude the benefit trust funds from receiving contributions in the form of AEP securities, provided that the AEP securities acquired by each plan may not exceed the limitations imposed by law.\nFor equity investments, the concentration limits are generally as follows:\n\u2022No security in excess of 5% of all equities.\n\u2022Cash equivalents must be less than 10% of an investment manager\u2019s equity portfolio.\n\u2022No individual stock may be more than 10% and 7% for pension and OPEB investments, respectively, of each manager\u2019s equity portfolio.\n\u2022No securities may be bought or sold on margin or other use of leverage.\nFor fixed income investments, each investment manager\u2019s portfolio is compared to investment grade, diversified long and intermediate benchmark indices.\nA portion of the pension assets is invested in real estate funds to provide diversification, add return and hedge against inflation. Real estate properties are illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded. The pension plan uses external real estate investment managers to invest in commingled funds that hold real estate properties. To mitigate investment risk in the real estate portfolio, commingled real estate funds are used to ensure that holdings are diversified by region, property type and risk classification. Real estate holdings include core, value-added and opportunistic classifications.\nA portion of the pension assets is invested in private equity. Private equity investments add return and provide diversification and typically require a long-term time horizon to evaluate investment performance. Private equity is classified as an alternative investment because it is illiquid, difficult to value and not actively traded. The pension plan uses limited partnerships to invest across the private equity investment spectrum. The private equity holdings are with multiple general partners who help monitor the investments and provide investment selection expertise. The holdings are currently comprised of venture capital, buyout and hybrid debt and equity investments.\nAEP participates in a securities lending program with BNY Mellon to provide incremental income on idle assets and to provide income to offset custody fees and other administrative expenses. AEP lends securities to borrowers approved by BNY Mellon in exchange for collateral. All loans are collateralized by at least 102% of the loaned asset\u2019s market value and the collateral is invested. The difference between the rebate owed to the borrower and the collateral rate of return determines the earnings on the loaned security. The securities lending program\u2019s objective is to provide modest incremental income with a limited increase in risk. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of securities on loan as part of the program was $62 million and $83 million, respectively. Cash and securities obtained as collateral exceeded the fair value of the securities loaned as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTrust owned life insurance (TOLI) underwritten by The Prudential Insurance Company is held in the OPEB plan trusts. The strategy for holding life insurance contracts in the taxable Voluntary Employees\u2019 Beneficiary Association trust is to minimize taxes paid on the asset growth in the trust. Earnings on plan assets are tax-deferred within the TOLI contract and can be tax-free if held until claims are paid. Life insurance proceeds remain in the trust and are used to fund future retiree medical benefit liabilities. With consideration to other investments held in the trust, the cash value of the TOLI contracts is invested in two diversified funds. A portion is invested in a commingled fund with underlying investments in stocks that are actively traded on major international equity exchanges. The other portion of the TOLI cash value is invested in a diversified, commingled fixed income fund with underlying investments in government bonds, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities.\nCash and cash equivalents are held in each trust to provide liquidity and meet short-term cash needs. Cash equivalent funds are used to provide diversification and preserve principal. The underlying holdings in the cash funds are investment grade money market instruments including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, treasury bills and other types of investment grade short-term debt securities. The cash funds are valued each business day and provide daily liquidity.\nNuclear Trust Funds (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nNuclear decommissioning and SNF trust funds represent funds that regulatory commissions allow I&M to collect through rates to fund future decommissioning and SNF disposal liabilities. By rules or orders, the IURC, the MPSC and the FERC established investment limitations and general risk management guidelines. In general, limitations include:\n\u2022Acceptable investments (rated investment grade or above when purchased).\n\u2022Maximum percentage invested in a specific type of investment.\n\u2022Prohibition of investment in obligations of AEP, I&M or their affiliates.\n\u2022Withdrawals permitted only for payment of decommissioning costs and trust expenses.\nI&M maintains trust funds for each regulatory jurisdiction. Regulatory approval is required to withdraw decommissioning funds. These funds are managed by an external investment manager that must comply with the guidelines and rules of the applicable regulatory authorities. The trust assets are invested to optimize the net of tax earnings of the trust giving consideration to liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives.\nI&M records securities held in these trust funds in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on its balance sheets. I&M records these securities at fair value. I&M classifies debt securities in the trust funds as available-for-sale due to their long-term purpose.\nOther-than-temporary impairments for investments in debt securities are considered realized losses as a result of securities being managed by an external investment management firm. The external investment management firm makes specific\ninvestment decisions regarding the debt and equity investments held in these trusts and generally intends to sell debt securities in an unrealized loss position as part of a tax optimization strategy. Impairments reduce the cost basis of the securities which will affect any future unrealized gain or realized gain or loss due to the adjusted cost of investment. I&M records unrealized gains, unrealized losses and other-than-temporary impairments from securities in these trust funds as adjustments to the regulatory liability account for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and to regulatory assets or liabilities for the SNF disposal trust funds in accordance with their treatment in rates. Consequently, changes in fair value of trust assets do not affect earnings or AOCI. See the \u201cNuclear Contingencies\u201d section of Note 6 for additional discussion of nuclear matters. See \u201cFair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal\u201d section of Note 11 for disclosure of the fair value of assets within the trusts.\nComprehensive Income (Loss) (Applies to AEP only)\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income (loss) has two components: net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP had performance shares and restricted stock units outstanding under the American Electric Power System 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2015 LTIP). Upon vesting, all outstanding performance shares and restricted stock units settle in AEP common stock. The impact of AEP\u2019s stock-based compensation plan is insignificant to the financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.\nAEP maintains a variety of tax qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans for employees and non-employee directors that include, among other options, an investment in or an investment return equivalent to that of AEP common stock. This includes AEP career shares maintained under the American Electric Power System Stock Ownership Requirement Plan (SORP), which facilitates executives in meeting minimum stock ownership requirements assigned to them by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. AEP career shares are derived from vested performance shares granted to employees under the 2015 LTIP and previous long-term incentive plans. AEP career shares accrue additional dividend shares in an amount equal to dividends paid on AEP common shares at the closing market price on the dividend payments date. All AEP career shares are settled in shares of AEP common stock after the executive\u2019s service with AEP ends.\nPerformance shares awarded after January 1, 2017 are classified as temporary equity in the Mezzanine Equity section of the balance sheets until the awards vest. Upon vesting, the performance shares are classified as permanent equity. These awards may be settled in cash upon an employee\u2019s qualifying termination due to a change in control. Because such event is not solely within the control of the company, these awards are classified outside of permanent equity until the awards vest.\nAEP compensates their non-employee directors, in part, with stock units under the American Electric Power Company, Inc. Stock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Prior to June 2022, these stock units were payable in cash to directors after their service ended and are now payable in AEP common stock.\nManagement measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. For share-based payment awards with service only vesting conditions, management recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis. Stock-based compensation expense recognized on the statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is based on the number of outstanding awards at the end of each period without a reduction for estimated forfeitures. AEP accounts for forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, compensation costs are included in Net Income for the performance shares, career shares, restricted stock units, the non-employee director stock units and other qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans that provide an investment in or an investment return equivalent to that of AEP common stock. Compensation costs may also be capitalized. See Note 15 - Stock-based Compensation for additional information.\nEquity Method Investments in Unconsolidated Entities (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nThe equity method of accounting is used for equity investments where either AEP or SWEPCo exercise significant influence but do not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are initially recorded at cost in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets. The proportionate share of the investee\u2019s equity earnings or losses is included in\nEquity Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on the statements of income. AEP and SWEPCo regularly monitor and evaluate equity method investments to determine whether they are impaired. An impairment is recognized when the investment has experienced a loss in value that is other-than-temporary in nature.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP\u2019s significant equity method investments include ETT and DHLC. In August 2023, AEP disposed of four joint venture interests as a part of the sale of AEP Renewables\u2019 competitive contracted renewables portfolio. Prior to the sale, these joint venture interests were accounted for as equity method investments. See the \u201cDisposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio\u201d section of Note 7 and the \u201cAEP Wind Holdings, LLC \u201d section of Note 17 for additional information.\nEarnings Per Share (EPS) (Applies to AEP)\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted-average outstanding common shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock awards.\nThe following table presents AEP\u2019s basic and diluted EPS calculations included on the statements of income:\nThere were no antidilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nSupplementary Income Statement Information\nThe following tables provide the components of Depreciation and Amortization for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nSupplementary Cash Flow Information (Applies to AEP)\n2. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nDuring the FASB\u2019s standard-setting process and upon issuance of final standards, management reviews the new accounting literature to determine its relevance, if any, to the Registrants\u2019 business. The following standards will impact the Registrants\u2019 financial statements.\nASU 2023-09 \u201cImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\u201d (ASU 2023-09)\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, to address investors\u2019 suggested enhancements to (a) better understand an entity\u2019s exposure to potential changes in jurisdictional tax legislation and the ensuing risks and opportunities, (b) assess income tax information that affects cash flow forecasts and capital allocation decisions and (c) identify potential opportunities to increase future cash flows.\nThe new standard requires an annual rate reconciliation disclosure of the following categories regardless of materiality: state and local income tax net of federal income tax effect, foreign tax effects, effect of changes in tax laws or rates enacted in the current period, effect of cross-border tax laws, tax credits, changes in valuation allowances, nontaxable or nondeductible items and changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe new standard also requires an annual disclosure of the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and by individual jurisdictions that are equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid. Disclosure of income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign jurisdictions and income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions is required.\nThe new standard removes the requirement to disclose the cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference when a deferred tax liability is not recognized because of the exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures.\nThe amendments in the new standard may be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. Management has not yet made a decision to early adopt the amendments to this standard or how to apply them.\nASU 2023-07 \u201cImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\u201d (ASU 2023-07)\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, to address investors\u2019 observations that there is limited information disclosed about segment expenses and to better understand expense categories and amounts included in segment profit or loss. The new standard requires annual and interim disclosure of (a) the categories and amounts of significant segment expenses (determined by management using both qualitative and quantitative factors) that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (b) the amounts and a qualitative description of \u201cother segment items\u201d, defined as the difference between reported segment revenues less the significant segment expenses and each reported measure of segment profit or loss disclosed, (c) reportable segment profit or loss and assets that are currently only required annually, (d) the CODM\u2019s title and position, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources and (e) a requirement that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by ASU 2023-07 and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. Additionally, this new standard allows disclosure of one or more of additional profit or loss measures if the CODM uses more than one measure provided that at least one of the disclosed measures is determined in a manner \u201cmost consistent with the measurement principles under GAAP\u201d. If multiple measures are presented, additional disclosure is required about how the CODM uses each measure to assess performance and decide how to allocate resources.\nThe amendments in the new standard are effective on a retrospective basis for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. Management does not plan to early adopt the amendments to this standard.\n3. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP only. The impact of AOCI is not material to the financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.\nPresentation of Comprehensive Income\nThe following tables provide AEP\u2019s components of changes in AOCI and details of reclassifications from AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The amortization of pension and OPEB AOCI components are included in the computation of net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 8 - Benefit Plans for additional information.\n(a)Amounts reclassified to the referenced line item on the statements of income.\n4. RATE MATTERS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants are involved in rate and regulatory proceedings at the FERC and their state commissions. Rate matters can have a material impact on net income, cash flows and possibly financial condition. The Registrants\u2019 recent significant rate orders and pending rate filings are addressed in this note.\nAEP Texas Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nAEP Texas Interim Transmission and Distribution Rates\nThrough December 31, 2023, AEP Texas\u2019 cumulative revenues from interim base rate increases that are subject to a prudency review is approximately $987 million. A base rate review could result in a refund to customers if AEP Texas incurs a disallowance of the transmission or distribution investment on which an interim increase was based. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission and distribution rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. AEP Texas is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than April 5, 2024.\nAPCo and WPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and APCo)\n2020-2022 Virginia Triennial Review\nIn March 2023, APCo submitted its 2020-2022 Virginia triennial review filing and base rate case with the Virginia SCC as required by state law. APCo requested a $213 million annual increase in Virginia base rates based upon a proposed 10.6% return on common equity. The requested annual increase includes $47 million related to vegetation management and a $35 million increase in depreciation expense. The requested increase in depreciation expense reflects, among other things, the impacts of incremental investments made since APCo\u2019s last depreciation study using property balances as of December 31, 2022. Effective January 1, 2023 and in accordance with past Virginia SCC directives, APCo implemented updated Virginia depreciation rates. APCo\u2019s proposed revenue requirement also includes the recovery of certain costs incurred that partially contributed to APCo\u2019s calculated earnings shortfall for the 2020-2022 triennial period. For triennial review periods in which a Virginia utility earns below its authorized ROE band, the utility may file to recover expenses incurred, up to the bottom of the authorized ROE band, related to certain categories of costs, including system restoration costs for severe weather events.\nIn August 2023, APCo, Virginia Staff and intervening parties reached a settlement agreement that included the following: (a) a $127 million annual increase in Virginia base rates, (b) a 9.5% ROE, (c) updated depreciation rates that reflect a 2040 Amos Plant retirement date, (d) approval of a regulatory asset, including tax gross-up, to be recovered over three years starting in 2024 related to major storm expenses incurred during the 2020-2022 triennial period when APCo under-earned in Virginia, (e) approval of the revenue requirement impact of net operating loss carryforward related to income taxes and approval of deferral authority for corporate alternative minimum taxes incurred and (f) approval of the revenue requirement impact of an increase in vegetation management costs with certain costs subject to over-/under-recovery accounting. In November 2023, the Virginia SCC issued a final order approving the settlement agreement as described above with new rates taking effect in January 2024.\nENEC (Expanded Net Energy Cost) Filings\nIn April 2023, APCo and WPCo (the Companies) submitted their 2023 annual ENEC filing with the WVPSC, proposing two alternatives to increase ENEC rates effective September 1, 2023 and to resolve the Companies\u2019 open 2021 and 2022 ENEC filings. The first alternative was a $293 million annual increase in ENEC rates comprised of an $89 million increase for current year ENEC expense and a $200 million annual increase for the recovery of the Companies\u2019 February 28, 2023 ENEC under-recovery balances over three years, including debt and equity carrying costs. The second alternative was an $89 million annual increase in ENEC rates with the Companies securitizing approximately $1.9 billion of assets, including: (a) $553 million relating to ENEC under-recoveries as of February 28, 2023, (b) $88 million relating to major storm expense deferrals and (c) $1.2 billion relating to APCo\u2019s West Virginia jurisdictional book values of the Amos and Mountaineer Plants and forecasted CCR and ELG investments at these generating facilities.\nIn September 2023, the WVPSC issued an order on the 2023 ENEC filing approving an $89 million annual increase in ENEC surcharge rates for the Companies\u2019 forecasted costs for the period September 2023 through August 2024.\nIn January 2024, the WVPSC issued an order resolving the Companies\u2019 2021-2023 ENEC cases. In the order, the WVPSC: (a) disallowed $232 million in ENEC under-recovered costs as of February 28, 2023 ($136 million related to APCo) and (b) approved the recovery of $321 million of ENEC under-recovered costs as of February 28, 2023 ($174 million related to APCo) plus a 4% carrying charge rate over a ten-year recovery period starting September 1, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Companies\u2019 financial statements reflect the impact of the disallowance. In February 2024, the Companies filed briefs with the\nWest Virginia Supreme Court to initiate an appeal of this order. The Companies will submit their annual ENEC update filing with the WVPSC in the second quarter of 2024 proposing that updated ENEC rates become effective September 1, 2024.\nETT Rate Matters (Applies to AEP)\nETT Interim Transmission Rates\nAEP has a 50% equity ownership interest in ETT. Predominantly all of ETT\u2019s revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next base rate proceeding. Through December 31, 2023, AEP\u2019s share of ETT\u2019s cumulative revenues that are subject to a prudency review is approximately $1.7 billion. A base rate review could produce a refund to customers if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim increase was based. A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. ETT is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than February 1, 2025, during which the $1.7 billion of cumulative revenues above will be subject to review.\nI&M Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nMichigan Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR)\nIn April 2023, I&M received intervenor testimony in I&M\u2019s 2021 PSCR Reconciliation for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2021, recommending disallowances of purchased power costs of $18 million associated with the OVEC Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) and the UPA with AEGCo that were alleged to be above market in applying the MPSC\u2019s Code of Conduct rules. Michigan staff submitted testimony in I&M\u2019s 2021 PSCR Reconciliation with no recommended disallowances for PSCR costs incurred, including those associated with the OVEC ICPA and the AEGCo UPA. Michigan staff also recommended several options to address I&M\u2019s shortfall in achieving Michigan\u2019s annual one percent energy waste reduction savings level, resulting in potential future disallowed costs of up to approximately $14 million. In June 2023, Michigan staff submitted rebuttal testimony to update their calculation of the 2021 market proxy price resulting in a recommended disallowance of approximately $1 million related to the OVEC ICPA.\nIn January 2024, I&M received staff testimony in I&M\u2019s 2022 PSCR Reconciliation for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2022 recommending disallowances of purchased power costs of $2 million associated with the OVEC ICPA that were alleged to be above market in applying the MPSC\u2019s Code of Conduct rules. Similar to the 2021 PSCR Reconciliation, Michigan staff also recommended several options to address I&M\u2019s shortfall in achieving Michigan\u2019s annual one percent energy waste reduction savings level, resulting in potential future disallowed costs of up to approximately $6 million.\nMPSC orders on I&M\u2019s 2021 and 2022 PSCR Reconciliations are expected in the first half of 2024. If any PSCR costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2023 Indiana Base Rate Case\nIn August 2023, I&M filed a request with the IURC for a $116 million annual increase in Indiana base rates based upon a 2024 forecasted test year, a proposed 10.5% ROE and a proposed capital structure of 48.8% debt and 51.2% common equity. I&M proposed that the annual increase in base rates be implemented in two steps, with the first increase effective in mid-2024, following an IURC order, and the second increase effective in January 2025. The proposed annual increase includes a $41 million increase related to depreciation expense, driven by increased depreciation rates and increased capital investments, and a $15 million increase related to storm expenses. I&M\u2019s Indiana base case filing requests recovery of certain historical period regulatory asset balances and proposes deferral accounting for certain future investments and tax related issues, including corporate alternative minimum tax expense and PTCs related to the Cook Plant.\nIn December 2023, I&M and intervenors reached a settlement agreement that was submitted to the IURC recommending a two-step increase in Indiana rates with a $28 million annual increase effective upon an IURC order and the remaining $34 million annual increase effective in January 2025. The recommended revenue increase includes: (a) a 9.85% ROE, (b) a two-step update of I&M\u2019s capital structure with a capital structure of 50% for both debt and common equity effective upon an IURC order and I&M will submit an updated capital structure in January 2025 with the common equity component adjusted to no more than 51.2%, (c) a $25 million increase related to depreciation expense and (d) an $11 million increase related to storm expenses.\nA hearing was held in January 2024 and an order is expected in the second quarter of 2024. If any costs included in this filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2023 Michigan Base Rate Case\nIn September 2023, I&M filed a request with the MPSC for a $34 million annual increase in Michigan base rates based upon a 2024 forecasted test year, a proposed 10.5% ROE and a capital structure of 49.4% debt and 50.6% common equity. The proposed annual increase includes an $11 million annual increase in depreciation expense driven by increased capital investment. I&M\u2019s Michigan base case filing requests recovery of certain historical period regulatory asset balances and proposes deferral accounting for certain future investments and tax related issues, including corporate alternative minimum tax expense and PTCs related to the Cook Plant.\nIn January 2024, Michigan Staff and various intervenors submitted testimony recommending changes in base rates ranging from a $6 million annual decrease to a $19 million annual increase. These changes are based on ROEs ranging from 9.7% to 9.9% and capital structures ranging from 49.4% debt and 50.6% equity to 52% debt and 48% equity. Intervenors also proposed in testimony certain disallowances related to existing regulatory assets totaling approximately $5 million, the exclusion of CAMT from any future deferrals and the prospective inclusion of PTCs related to the Cook Plant in I&M\u2019s PSCR.\nA hearing was held in February 2024. If any costs included in this filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nKPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP)\nInvestigation of the Service, Rates and Facilities of KPCo\nIn June 2023, the KPSC issued an order directing KPCo to show cause why it should not be subject to Kentucky statutory remedies, including fines and penalties, for failure to provide adequate service in its service territory. The KPSC\u2019s show cause order did not make any determination regarding the adequacy of KPCo\u2019s service. In July 2023, KPCo filed a response to the show cause order demonstrating that it has provided adequate service. In December 2023 and February 2024, KPCo and certain intervenors filed testimony with the KPSC. In February 2024, KPCo filed a motion to strike and exclude intervenor testimony in its entirety on the grounds that issues raised are outside the scope of the proceeding and because the testimony is largely unreasoned, unsupported, and provides no evidentiary value. A hearing is expected in 2024. If any fines or penalties are levied against KPCo relating to the show cause order, it could reduce net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2023 Kentucky Base Rate and Securitization Case\nIn June 2023, KPCo filed a request with the KPSC for a $94 million net annual increase in base rates based upon a proposed 9.9% ROE with the increase to be implemented no earlier than January 2024. The filing proposes no changes in depreciation rates and an annual level of storm restoration expense in base rates of approximately $1 million. KPCo also proposed to discontinue tracking of PJM transmission costs through a rider, and to instead collect an annual level of costs through base rates. In addition, KPCo has proposed a rider to recover certain distribution reliability investments and related incremental operation and maintenance expenses. KPCo also requested a prudency determination and recovery mechanism for approximately $16 million of purchased power costs not recoverable through its FAC since its last base case. KPCo\u2019s proposal did not address the disposition of its 50% interest in Mitchell Plant, which will be addressed in the future. As of December 31, 2023, the net book value of KPCo\u2019s share of the Mitchell Plant, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory, was $553 million. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nIn conjunction with its June 2023 filing, KPCo further requested to finance, through the issuance of securitization bonds, approximately $471 million of regulatory assets recorded as of June 2023 including: (a) $289 million of plant retirement costs, (b) $79 million of deferred storm costs related to 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 major storms, (c) $52 million of deferred purchased power expenses and (d) $51 million of under-recovered purchased power rider costs. Plant retirement costs and deferred purchased power expenses have been deemed prudent in prior KPSC decisions. KPCo has requested a prudency determination in this proceeding for the deferred storm costs and under-recovered purchase power rider costs since the last base case.\nIn November 2023, KPCo filed an uncontested settlement agreement with the KPSC, that included an annual base rate increase of $75 million, based upon a 9.75% ROE. Settlement parties agreed that the KPSC should approve KPCo\u2019s securitization request, and that the approximately $471 million regulatory assets requested for securitization are comprised of prudently incurred costs. The settlement does not modify KPCo\u2019s proposal to discontinue tracking of PJM transmission costs through a\nrider, and to instead collect an annual level of costs through base rates. The settlement approved KPCo\u2019s request to implement a rider to recover certain distribution reliability investments. Under the terms of the settlement, KPCo agreed to forgo recovery of approximately $16 million of purchased power costs not recoverable through the FAC since KPCo\u2019s last base case and excluded a return on its stand-alone NOLC deferred tax asset from the base rate revenue requirement while it seeks a private letter ruling from the IRS. Other differences between KPCo\u2019s requested annual base rate increase and the uncontested settlement agreement are primarily due to exclusion of certain employee-related expenses from the revenue requirement.\nIn January 2024, consistent with the November 2023 uncontested settlement agreement, the KPSC issued a financing order approving KPCo\u2019s securitization request and concluding that costs requested for recovery were prudently incurred. The KPSC\u2019s financing order includes certain additional requirements related to securitization bond structuring, marketing, placement, and issuance that were not reflected in KPCo\u2019s proposal. As a result, in January 2024, KPCo filed a request for rehearing with the KPSC to clarify certain aspects of these additional requirements. In February 2024, the KPSC denied KPCo\u2019s rehearing requests. In accordance with Kentucky statutory requirements and the financing order, the issuance of the securitized bonds is subject to final review by the KPSC after bond pricing. KPCo expects to proceed with the securitized bond issuance process and to complete the securitization process in the second half of 2024, subject to market conditions. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nIn January 2024, the KPSC issued an order modifying the November 2023 uncontested settlement agreement and approving an annual base rate increase of $60 million based upon a 9.75% ROE effective with billing cycles mid-January 2024. The order reduced KPCo\u2019s base rate revenue requirement by $14 million to allow recovery of actual test year PJM transmission costs instead of KPCo\u2019s requested annual level of costs based on PJM 2023 projected transmission revenue requirements. The KPSC denied implementation of a rider to recover certain distribution reliability investments. In February 2024, KPCo filed an appeal with the Commonwealth of Kentucky Franklin Circuit Court, challenging among other aspects of the order the $14 million base rate revenue requirement reduction.\nFuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) Review\nIn December 2023, KPCo received intervenor testimony in its FAC review for the two-year period ending October 31, 2022, recommending a disallowance ranging from $44 million to $60 million of its total $432 million purchased power cost recoveries as a result of proposed modifications to the ratemaking methodology that limits purchased power costs recoverable through the FAC. A hearing was held in February 2024. If any fuel costs are not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRockport Offset Recovery\nIn January 2024, KPCo filed an application with the KPSC seeking to recover an allowed cost (Rockport Offset) of $41 million in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement in the 2017 Kentucky Base Rate Case permitting KPCo to use the level of non-fuel, non-environmental Rockport Plant UPA expense included in base rates to earn its authorized ROE in 2023 since the Rockport UPA ended in December 2022. An estimated Rockport Offset of $23 million was recovered through a rider, subject to true-up, during the 12-months ended December 2023. KPCo is requesting to recover the remaining $18 million Rockport Offset true-up over a 12-month period beginning March 2024, also through a rider. The Rockport Offset true-up is not yet reflected in revenue, as KPCo has not met the requirements of alternative revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations\u201d. In February 2024, the KPSC issued an order allowing KPCo to collect the remaining $18 million through interim rates, subject to refund, over twelve months starting in March 2024. Intervenor testimony is expected in April 2024 and an order is expected in the second quarter of 2024. If the Rockport Offset is not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nOPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nOVEC Cost Recovery Audits\nIn December 2021, as part of OVEC cost recovery audits pending before the PUCO, intervenors filed positions claiming that costs incurred by OPCo during the 2018-2019 audit period were imprudent and should be disallowed. In May 2022, intervenors filed for rehearing on the 2016-2017 OVEC cost recovery audit period claiming the PUCO\u2019s April 2022 order to adopt the findings of the audit report were unjust, unlawful and unreasonable for multiple reasons, including the position that OPCo recovered imprudently incurred costs. In June 2022, the PUCO granted rehearing on the 2016-2017 audit period for purposes of further consideration.\nIn May 2023, as part of the OVEC cost recovery audits pending before the PUCO, intervenors filed positions claiming that costs incurred by OPCo during the 2020 audit period were imprudent and should be disallowed. A hearing was held in November 2023.\nManagement disagrees with these claims and is unable to predict the impact of these disputes. If any costs are disallowed or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nOhio ESP Filings\nIn January 2023, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments, proposed new riders and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, including the DIR, effective June 2024 through May 2030. The proposal includes a return on common equity of 10.65% on capital costs for certain riders. In June 2023, intervenors filed testimony opposing OPCo\u2019s plan for various new riders and modifications to existing riders, including the DIR. In September 2023, OPCo and certain intervenors filed a settlement agreement with the PUCO addressing the ESP application. The settlement included a four year term from June 2024 through May 2028, an ROE of 9.7% and continuation of a number of riders including the DIR subject to revenue caps. An order from the PUCO is expected in the first quarter of 2024. If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect its ESP rates it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nPSO Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and PSO)\n2022 Oklahoma Base Rate Case\nIn November 2022, PSO filed a request with the OCC for an annual base rate increase of $294 million based upon a 10.4% ROE with a capital structure of 45.4% debt and 54.6% common equity. The requested $294 million annual base rate increase, net of existing rider revenues and certain incremental renewable facility benefits expected to be provided to customers through riders, represented a requested annual increase in rates of $173 million and included a $47 million annual depreciation expense increase related to the accelerated depreciation recovery of the Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2026, and a $16 million annual amortization expense increase to recover intangible plant over a 5-year useful life instead of a 10-year useful life. PSO\u2019s request also included recovery of the 155 MW Rock Falls Wind Facility through base rates to aid PSO\u2019s near-term capacity needs and support compliance with SPP\u2019s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin requirements.\nIn November 2023, the OCC issued a final order approving an annual base rate increase of $131 million based upon a 9.3% ROE. As a result of the final order, PSO is required to exclude Rock Falls Wind Facility from recovery through base rates until a future base case since the facility was placed into service for PSO customers after the conclusion of the customary six-month post-test year period for ratemaking adjustments. In addition, PSO must provide Rock Falls Wind Facility benefits in excess of $21 million on an annual basis to customers through a rider. The order also stipulates PSO\u2019s proposals related to inclusion of a stand-alone NOLC deferred tax asset in rate base will be addressed in a future proceeding, upon receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS. Effective January 2024, interim rates implemented in May 2023 concluded and updated rates and tariffs were implemented in accordance with the final order. In January 2024, refund of the $18 million interim rate over collection began and will be competed no later than April 2024, in compliance with the final order. In December 2023, PSO appealed certain elements of the OCC\u2019s final order to the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma.\n2024 Oklahoma Base Rate Case\nIn January 2024, PSO filed a request with the OCC for a $218 million annual base rate increase based upon a 10.8% ROE with a capital structure of 48.9% debt and 51.1% common equity. PSO requested an expanded transmission cost recovery rider and a mechanism to recover generation costs necessary to comply with SPP\u2019s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin requirements. PSO\u2019s request reflects recovery of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2040.\nSWEPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\n2012 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk Plant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant\u2019s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo\u2019s recovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs.\nUpon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant\u2019s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap. As a result, SWEPCo reversed $114 million of a previously recorded regulatory disallowance in 2013. In 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT\u2019s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the Texas Third Court of Appeals.\nIn August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court judgment affirming the PUCT\u2019s order on AFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT\u2019s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas\njurisdictional capital cost cap, and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. In November 2021, SWEPCo and the PUCT submitted Petitions for Review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October 2022, the Texas Supreme Court denied the Petitions for Review submitted by SWEPCo and the PUCT. In December 2022, SWEPCo and the PUCT filed requests for rehearing with the Texas Supreme Court. In June 2023, the Texas Supreme Court denied SWEPCo\u2019s request for rehearing and the case was remanded to the PUCT for future proceedings. In October 2023, SWEPCo filed testimony with the PUCT in the remanded proceeding recommending no refund or disallowance.\nOn December 14, 2023, the PUCT approved a preliminary order stating the PUCT will not address SWEPCo\u2019s request that would allow the PUCT to find cause to allow SWEPCo to exceed the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap in the current remand proceeding. As a result of the PUCT\u2019s approval of the preliminary order, SWEPCo believes it is probable the PUCT will disallow capitalized AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap and recorded a pretax, non-cash disallowance of $86 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Such determination may reduce SWEPCo\u2019s future revenues by approximately $15 million on an annual basis. On December 21, 2023, SWEPCo filed a motion with the PUCT for reconsideration of the preliminary order. In January 2024, the PUCT denied the motion for reconsideration of the preliminary order.\nThe PUCT\u2019s December 2023 approval of the preliminary order determined that it will address, in the ongoing PUCT remand proceeding, any potential revenue refunds to customers that may be required by future PUCT orders. In January 2024, the PUCT established a procedural schedule for the remand proceeding. Supplemental testimony from SWEPCo is due in March 2024, intervenor and staff testimony is due in April 2024 and a hearing is scheduled for May 2024. Although SWEPCo does not currently believe any refunds are probable of occurring, SWEPCo estimates it could be required to make customer refunds, including interest, ranging from $0 to $200 million related to revenues collected from February 2013 through December 2023.\n2016 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn 2016, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $69 million based upon a 10% ROE. In January 2018, the PUCT issued a final order approving a net increase in Texas annual revenues of $50 million based upon a ROE of 9.6%, effective May 2017. The final order also included: (a) approval to recover the Texas jurisdictional share of environmental investments placed in-service, as of June 30, 2016, at various plants, including Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, (b) approval of recovery of, but no return on, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, (c) approval of $2 million in additional vegetation management expenses and (d) the rejection of SWEPCo\u2019s proposed transmission cost recovery mechanism.\nAs a result of the final order, in 2017 SWEPCo: (a) recorded an impairment charge of $19 million, which included $7 million associated with the lack of return on Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and $12 million related to other disallowed plant investments, (b) recognized $32 million of additional revenues, for the period of May 2017 through December 2017, that was surcharged to customers in 2018 and (c) recognized an additional $7 million of expenses consisting primarily of depreciation expense and vegetation management expense, offset by the deferral of rate case expense. SWEPCo implemented new rates in February 2018 billings. The $32 million of additional 2017 revenues was collected during 2018. In March 2018, the PUCT clarified and corrected portions of the final order, without changing the overall decision or amounts of the rate change. The order has been appealed by various intervenors related to limiting SWEPCo\u2019s recovery of AFUDC on Turk Plant and recovery of Welsh Plant, Unit 2. If certain parts of the PUCT order are overturned, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n2020 Texas Base Rate Case\nIn October 2020, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a $105 million annual increase in Texas base rates based upon a proposed 10.35% ROE. The request would move transmission and distribution interim revenues recovered through riders into base rates. Eliminating these riders would result in a net annual requested base rate increase of $90 million primarily due to increased investments. SWEPCo subsequently filed a request with the PUCT lowering the requested annual increase in Texas base rates to $100 million which would result in an $85 million net annual base rate increase after moving the proposed riders to rate base.\nIn January 2022, the PUCT issued a final order approving an annual revenue increase of $39 million based upon a 9.25% ROE. The order also includes: (a) rates implemented retroactively back to March 18, 2021, (b) $5 million of the proposed increase related to vegetation management, (c) $2 million annually to establish a storm catastrophe reserve and (d) the creation of a rider to recover the Dolet Hills Power Station as if it were in rate base until its retirement at the end of 2021 and starting in 2022 the remaining net book value to be recovered as a regulatory asset through 2046. As a result of the final order, SWEPCo recorded a disallowance of $12 million in 2021 associated with the lack of return on the Dolet Hills Power Station. In February 2022, SWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT challenging several errors in the order, which include challenges of the approved ROE, the denial of a reasonable return or carrying costs on the Dolet Hills Power Station and the calculation of the Texas jurisdictional share of the storm catastrophe reserve. In April 2022, the PUCT denied the motion for rehearing. In May\n2022, SWEPCo filed a petition for review with the Texas District Court seeking a judicial review of the several errors challenged in the PUCT\u2019s final order.\n2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case\nIn December 2020, SWEPCo filed a request with the LPSC for a $134 million annual increase in Louisiana base rates based upon a proposed 10.35% ROE. SWEPCo\u2019s requested annual increase includes accelerated depreciation related to the Dolet Hills Power Station, Pirkey Power Plant and Welsh Plant, all of which were or are expected to be retired early. SWEPCo also included recovery of Welsh Plant, Unit 2 over the blended useful life of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3. SWEPCo subsequently revised the requested annual increase to $95 million to reflect removing hurricane storm restoration costs from the base case filing, to modify the proposed recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station and revisions to various proposed amortizations. The hurricane costs have been requested in a separate storm filing. See \u201c2021 Louisiana Storm Cost Filing\u201d below for more information.\nIn January 2023, the LPSC approved a settlement which provides for an annual revenue increase of $27 million based upon a 9.5% ROE and includes: (a) a $21 million increase in base rates effective February 2023, (b) a $14 million rider to recover costs of the Dolet Hills Power Station and Pirkey Plant including a return, (c) an $8 million reduction in fuel rates, (d) adoption of a 3-year formula rate term subject to an earnings band and (e) the recovery of certain incremental SPP charges net of associated revenue and the Louisiana jurisdictional share of the return on and of projected transmission capital investment outside of the earnings band. The settlement agreement did not rule on the prudency of the early retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station, which is being addressed in a separate proceeding.\nThe primary differences between SWEPCo\u2019s requested annual rate increase and the agreed upon settlement increase are primarily due to: (a) a reduction in the requested ROE, (b) recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station and Pirkey Plant over ten years in a separate rider mechanism as opposed to base rates with accelerated depreciation rates, (c) maintaining existing depreciation rates for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 and (d) the severing of SWEPCo\u2019s proposed adjustment to include a stand-alone NOLC deferred tax asset in rate base.\nIn January 2023, a hearing was held related to the inclusion of a stand-alone NOLC deferred tax asset in rate base. In September 2023, an order was received from the LPSC directing SWEPCo to seek a private letter ruling from the IRS to address the matter.\n2021 Louisiana Storm Cost Filing\nIn 2020, Hurricanes Laura and Delta caused power outages and extensive damage to the SWEPCo service territories, primarily impacting the Louisiana jurisdiction. Following both hurricanes, the LPSC issued orders allowing Louisiana utilities, including SWEPCo, to establish regulatory assets to track and defer expenses associated with these storms. In February 2021, severe winter weather impacted the Louisiana jurisdiction and in March 2021, the LPSC approved the deferral of incremental storm restoration expenses related to the winter storm. In March 2023, SWEPCo and the LPSC staff filed a joint stipulation and settlement agreement with the LPSC which confirmed the prudency of $150 million of deferred incremental storm restoration expenses. The agreement also authorized an interim carrying charge at a rate of 3.125% until the recovery mechanism is determined in phase two of this proceeding. In April 2023, the LPSC issued an order approving the stipulation and settlement agreement. In July 2023, SWEPCo submitted additional information in phase two of this proceeding to obtain a financing order and prudency review of capital investment. The procedural schedule for this case states that a hearing will take place in the second quarter of 2024.\nFebruary 2021 Severe Winter Weather Impacts in SPP\nIn February 2021, severe winter weather had a significant impact in SPP, resulting in significantly increased market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. For the time period of February 9, 2021, to February 20, 2021, SWEPCo\u2019s natural gas expenses and purchases of electricity still to be recovered from customers are shown in the table below:\n(a)SWEPCo is permitted to record carrying costs on the unrecovered balance of fuel costs at a weighted-cost of capital approved by the APSC. The APSC will conclude an audit of these costs in 2024. A hearing is scheduled for May 2024.\n(b)In March 2021, the LPSC approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the FAC and shortly after SWEPCo began recovery of its Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs based on a five-year recovery period inclusive of an interim carrying charge equal to the prime rate. The special order states the fuel and purchased power costs incurred will be subject to a future LPSC audit.\nIf SWEPCo is unable to recover any of the costs relating to the extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity, or obtain authorization of a reasonable carrying charge on these costs, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nFERC Rate Matters\nFERC 2019 SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, PSO and SWEPCo)\nIn May 2021, certain joint customers submitted a formal challenge at the FERC related to the 2020 Annual Update of the 2019 SPP Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within SPP. In March 2022, the FERC issued an order granting the formal challenge on several issues and denying the formal challenge on other issues. Management has determined that the result of the order had an immaterial impact to the financial statements of AEP, AEPTCo, PSO and SWEPCo. In November 2022, certain joint customers appealed the FERC denial of issues to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In January 2024, the court agreed with the FERC\u2019s order and denied the certain joint customers petition for review.\nIndependence Energy Connection Project (Applies to AEP)\nIn 2016, PJM approved the Independence Energy Connection Project (IEC) and included it in its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan to alleviate congestion. Transource Energy has an ownership interest in the IEC, which is located in Maryland and Pennsylvania. In June 2020, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct the portion of the IEC in Maryland. In May 2021, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC) denied the IEC certificate for siting and construction of the portion in Pennsylvania. Transource Energy appealed the PAPUC ruling in Pennsylvania state court and challenged the ruling before the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In May 2022, the Pennsylvania state court issued an order affirming the PAPUC decision as to state law claims. In December 2023, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granted summary judgment in favor of Transource Energy, finding that the PAPUC decision violated federal law and the United States Constitution. In January 2024, the PAPUC filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Additional regulatory proceedings before the PAPUC are expected to resume in 2024.\nIn September 2021, PJM notified Transource Energy that the IEC was suspended to allow for the regulatory and related appeals process to proceed in an orderly manner without breaching milestone dates in the project agreement. At that time, PJM stated that the IEC has not been cancelled and remains necessary to alleviate congestion. PJM continues to evaluate reliability and market efficiency in the area. As of December 31, 2023, AEP\u2019s share of IEC capital expenditures was approximately $93 million, located in Total Property, Plant and Equipment - Net on AEP\u2019s balance sheets. The FERC has previously granted abandonment benefits for this project, allowing the full recovery of prudently incurred costs if the project is cancelled for reasons outside the control of Transource Energy. If any of the IEC costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nFERC RTO Incentive Complaint (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo and OPCo)\nIn February 2022, the OCC filed a complaint against AEPSC, American Transmission Systems, Inc. and Duke Energy Ohio, alleging the 50 basis point RTO incentive included in Ohio Transmission Owners\u2019 respective transmission formula rates is not just and reasonable and therefore should be eliminated on the basis that RTO participation is not voluntary, but rather is required by Ohio law. In March 2022, AEPSC filed a motion to dismiss the OCC\u2019s February 2022 complaint with the FERC on the basis of certain deficiencies, including that the complaint fails to request relief that can be granted under FERC regulations because AEPSC is not a public utility nor does it have a transmission rate on file with the FERC. In December 2022, the FERC issued an order removing the 50 basis point RTO incentive from OPCo and OHTCo transmission formula rates effective the date of the February 2022 complaint filing and directed OPCo and OHTCo to provide refunds, with interest, within sixty days of the date of its order. In January 2023, both AEPSC and the OCC filed requests for rehearing with the FERC. In February 2023, in compliance with the FERC\u2019s December 2022 order, AEPSC submitted a filing to the FERC to update OPCo and OHTCo 2023 transmission formula rates to exclude the 50 basis point RTO incentive and provide refunds with interest. In April 2023, the FERC approved the updated transmission formula rates for OPCo and OHTCo and issued an Order on Rehearing affirming its December 2022 decision. During 2023, in compliance with FERC\u2019s December 2022 order, OPCo and OHTCo provided refunds including interest of $5 million and $13 million, respectively. This decision has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\nRequest to Update AEGCo Depreciation Rates (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nIn October 2022, AEP, on behalf of AEGCo, submitted proposed revisions to AEGCo\u2019s depreciation rates for its 50% ownership interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 1 and Unit 2, reflected in the UPA between AEGCo and I&M. The proposed depreciation rates for these assets reflect an estimated 2028 retirement date for the Rockport Plant. AEGCo\u2019s previous FERC-approved depreciation rates for Rockport Plant, Unit 1 were based upon a December 31, 2028 estimated retirement date while AEGCo\u2019s previous FERC-approved depreciation rates for Rockport Plant, Unit 2 leasehold improvements were based upon a December 31, 2022 estimated retirement date in conjunction with the termination of the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease.\nIn December 2022, the FERC issued an order approving the proposed AEGCo Rockport depreciation rates effective January 1, 2023, subject to further review and a potential refund. The FERC established a separate proceeding to review: (a) AEGCo\u2019s acquisition value for the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 base generating asset (original cost and accumulated depreciation), (b) the appropriateness of including future capital additions as stated components in proposed depreciation rates, in light of the UPA\u2019s formula rate mechanism, (c) the appropriateness of applying two different depreciation rates to a single asset common to both units and (d) the accounting and regulatory treatment of Rockport Plant, Unit 2 costs of removal and related AROs. In August 2023, AEGCo reached a settlement agreement with the FERC Trial Staff that resolves all issues set for hearing. In September 2023, the settlement agreement was certified to the FERC as uncontested. An order from the FERC on this settlement agreement is expected in 2024. If the FERC finalizes the settlement agreement as proposed, management anticipates the results of the order will not have a material impact on financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFERC 2021 PJM and SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nThe Registrants transitioned to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in its PJM and SPP transmission formula rates beginning with the 2022 projected transmission revenue requirements and 2021 true-up to actual transmission revenue requirements and provided notice of this change in informational filings made with the FERC. Stand-alone treatment of the NOLCs for transmission formula rates increased the annual revenue requirements for years 2023, 2022 and 2021 by $60 million, $69 million and $78 million, respectively.\nIn March 2023 and May 2023, certain joint customers submitted a complaint and a formal challenge at the FERC related to the 2022 Annual Update of the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP, respectively. These challenges primarily relate to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in the transmission formula rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries. AEPSC, on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP, filed answers to the joint formal challenge and complaint with the FERC in the second quarter of 2023.\nIn January 2024, the FERC issued two orders, granting the joint customers\u2019 challenges related to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP. The FERC directed the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP to provide refunds with interest on all amounts collected for the 2021 rate year, and for such refunds to be reflected in the annual update for the next rate year. In February 2024, AEPSC on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP filed requests with the FERC that it grant rehearing and reverse findings in its January 2024 orders or establish hearing procedures to address outstanding factual issues.\nAs a result of the January 2024 FERC orders, the Registrants\u2019 2022 and 2023 income statements cumulatively reflect a provision for refund for the probable refund of all NOLC revenues included in transmission formula rates for years 2023, 2022 and 2021. The probable refunds to affiliated and nonaffiliated customers are reflected as Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets. Refunds probable to be received by affiliated companies, resulting in a reduction to affiliated transmission expense, were deferred as an increase to Regulatory Liabilities or a reduction to Regulatory Assets on the balance sheets where management expects that refunds would be returned to retail customers through authorized retail jurisdiction rider mechanisms. The FERC directed cash refunds with interest related to the 2021 rate year to occur through the annual update for the next rate year, which will be invoiced by PJM and SPP primarily in 2025. The Registrants have not yet been directed to make cash refunds related to the 2022 or 2023 rate years.\nThe FERC's January 2024 orders reduced AEP and AEPTCo's 2023 pretax net income by approximately $76 million and $74 million, respectively. The impact of the FERC's orders on the pretax net income of AEP's remaining Registrant Subsidiaries was not material.\nRequest to Update SWEPCo Generation Depreciation Rates (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn October 2023, SWEPCo filed an application to revise its generation wholesale customer\u2019s contracts to reflect an increase in the annual revenue requirement of approximately $5 million for updated depreciation rates and allow for the return on and of FERC customers jurisdictional share of regulatory assets associated with retired plants. In November 2023, certain intervenors filed a motion with the FERC protesting and recommending the rejection of SWEPCo\u2019s filings. In December 2023, the FERC issued an order approving the proposed rates effective January 1, 2024, subject to further review and refund and established hearing and settlement proceedings. If SWEPCo is unable to recover the remaining regulatory assets associated with retired plants, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n5. EFFECTS OF REGULATION\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nCoal-Fired Generation Plants (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo)\nCompliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal costs and permits. Management continuously evaluates cost estimates of complying with these regulations which has resulted in, and in the future may result in, a decision to retire coal-fired generating facilities earlier than their currently estimated useful lives.\nManagement is seeking or will seek regulatory recovery, as necessary, for any net book value remaining when the plants are retired. To the extent the net book value of these generation assets is not deemed recoverable, it could materially reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRegulated Generating Units that have been Retired\nSWEPCo\nIn December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired. As part of the 2020 Texas Base Rate Case, the PUCT authorized recovery of SWEPCo\u2019s Texas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2046, but denied SWEPCo the ability to earn a return on this investment resulting in a disallowance of $12 million in 2021. As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC authorized recovery of SWEPCo\u2019s Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2027, but denied SWEPCo the ability to earn a return on this investment resulting in a disallowance of $2 million in the second quarter of 2022. Also, the APSC did not rule on the prudency of the early retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station, which will be addressed in a future proceeding. As part of the 2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case, the LPSC authorized the recovery of SWEPCo\u2019s Louisiana share of the Dolet Hills Power Station, through a separate rider, through 2032, but did not rule on the prudency of the early retirement of the plant, which is being addressed in a separate proceeding. See \u201c2020 Texas Base Rate Case\u201d and \u201c2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case\u201d sections of Note 4 for additional information.\nIn March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. As part of the 2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case, the LPSC authorized the recovery of SWEPCo\u2019s Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Pirkey Plant, through a separate rider, through 2032. As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC granted SWEPCo regulatory asset treatment. SWEPCo will request recovery including a weighted average cost of capital carrying charge through a future proceeding. In July 2023, Texas ALJs issued a proposal for decision that concluded the decision to retire the Pirkey Plant was prudent. In September 2023, the PUCT rejected the ALJs proposal for decision concluding the retirement of the Pirkey Plant was prudent. In the open meeting, the commissioners expressed their concerns that the analysis in support of SWEPCo\u2019s decision to retire the Pirkey Plant was not robust enough and that SWEPCo should have re-evaluated the decision following Winter Storm Uri. The treatment of the cost of recovery of the Pirkey Plant is expected to be addressed in a future rate case. As of December 31, 2023, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of the Pirkey Plant was $67 million. To the extent any portion of the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of the Pirkey Plant is not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRegulated Generating Units to be Retired\nPSO\nIn 2014, PSO received final approval from the Federal EPA to close Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, in 2026. The plant was originally scheduled to close in 2040. As a result of the early retirement date, PSO revised the useful life of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, to the projected retirement date of 2026 and the incremental depreciation is being deferred as a regulatory asset. As part of the 2022 Oklahoma Base Rate Case, PSO will continue to recover Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2040.\nSWEPCo\nIn November 2020, management announced that it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028. As a result of the announcement, SWEPCo began recording a regulatory asset for accelerated depreciation.\nThe table below summarizes the net book value including CWIP, before cost of removal and materials and supplies, as of December 31, 2023, of generating facilities planned for early retirement:\nPlant Net Book Value Accelerated Depreciation Regulatory Asset Cost of Removal\nRegulatory Liability Projected\nRetirement Date Current Authorized\nRecovery Period Annual\nDepreciation (a)\n(dollars in millions)\nNortheastern Plant, Unit 3 $ 104.5 $ 164.2 $ 20.5 (b) 2026 (c) $ 15.0\nWelsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 352.0 125.6 58.2 (d) 2028 (e) (f) 38.6\n(a)Represents the amount of annual depreciation that has been collected from customers over the prior 12-month period.\n(b)Includes Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, which was retired in 2016. Removal of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, will be performed with the removal of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3, after retirement.\n(c)Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2040.\n(d)Includes Welsh Plant, Unit 2, which was retired in 2016. Removal of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, will be performed with the removal of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, after retirement.\n(e)Represents projected retirement date of coal assets, units are being evaluated for conversion to natural gas after 2028.\n(f)Unit 1 is being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Unit 3 is being recovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions.\nDolet Hills Power Station and Related Fuel Operations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired. While in operation, DHLC provided 100% of the fuel supply to Dolet Hills Power Station. The remaining book value of Dolet Hills Power Station non-fuel related assets are recoverable by SWEPCo through rate riders. As of December 31, 2023, SWEPCo\u2019s share of the net investment in the Dolet Hills Power Station was $103 million, including materials and supplies, net of cost of removal collected in rates. Fuel costs incurred by the Dolet Hills Power Station are recoverable by SWEPCo through active fuel clauses and are subject to prudency determinations by the various commissions. After closure of the DHLC mining operations and the Dolet Hills Power Station, additional reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by DHLC and Oxbow will continue to be billed to SWEPCo and included in existing fuel clauses. As of December 31, 2023, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of $77 million, inclusive of costs related to the Dolet Hills Power Station billed by DHLC, but excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter weather event.\nIn March 2021, the LPSC issued an order allowing SWEPCo to recover up to $20 million of fuel costs in 2021 and defer approximately $35 million of additional costs with a recovery period to be determined at a later date. In August 2022, the LPSC staff filed testimony recommending fuel disallowances of up to $55 million, including denial of recovery of the $35 million deferral, with refunds to customers over five years. In February 2024, an ALJ issued a final recommendation which included a proposed $55 million refund to customers and the denial of recovery of the $35 million deferral. SWEPCo filed a motion to present oral arguments with the LPSC to dispute the ALJ\u2019s recommendations. Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of the LPSC staff and ALJ recommendations. A decision from the LPSC is expected in the first quarter of 2024.\nIn March 2021, the APSC approved fuel rates that provide recovery of $20 million for the Arkansas share of the 2021 Dolet Hills Power Station fuel costs over five years through the existing fuel clause.\nIn September 2023, the PUCT approved an unopposed settlement agreement that provides recovery of $48 million of Oxbow mine related costs through 2035.\nIf any of these costs are not recoverable or customer refunds are required, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nPirkey Plant and Related Fuel Operations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. SWEPCo is recovering, or will seek recovery of, the remaining net book value of Pirkey Plant non-fuel costs. As of December 31, 2023, SWEPCo\u2019s share of the net investment in the Pirkey Plant was $182 million, including materials and supplies, net of cost of removal. See the \u201cRegulated Generating Units that have been Retired\u201d section above for additional information. Fuel costs are recovered through active fuel clauses and are subject to prudency determinations by the various commissions. As of March 31, 2023, SWEPCo fuel deliveries, including billings of all fixed costs, from Sabine ceased. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of $77 million, inclusive of costs related to the Pirkey Plant billed by Sabine, but excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter weather event. Remaining operational, reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by Sabine will be billed to SWEPCo and included in existing fuel clauses.\nIn July 2023, the LPSC ordered that a separate proceeding be established to review the prudence of the decision to retire the Pirkey Plant, including the costs included in fuel for years starting in 2019 and after. In September 2023, the PUCT approved an unopposed settlement agreement that provides recovery of $33 million of Sabine related fuel costs through 2035.\nIf any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nRegulatory assets and liabilities are comprised of the following items:\n(a)See \u201cFebruary 2021 Severe Winter Weather Impacts in SPP\u201d section of SWEPCo Rate Matters in Note 4 for additional information.\n(b)Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is approved for recovery through 2040, but expected to retire in 2026. PSO records a regulatory asset for accelerated depreciation.

COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Registrants\u2019 business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Registrants cannot be predicted. Management accrues contingent liabilities only when management concludes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When management determines that it is not probable, but rather reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, management discloses such contingencies and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can be made. Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the maximum possible loss exposure. Circumstances change over time and actual results may vary significantly from estimates.\nFor current proceedings not specifically discussed below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial statements.\nCOMMITMENTS (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nAEP subsidiaries have substantial commitments for fuel, energy and capacity contracts as part of the normal course of business. Certain contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination.\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cCommitments\u201d, the following tables summarize the Registrants\u2019 actual contractual commitments as of December 31, 2023:\nContractual Commitments - OPCo Less Than\n1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years After\n5 Years Total\n(in millions)\nEnergy and Capacity Purchase Contracts $ 33.4 $ 66.6 $ 66.3 $ 102.6 $ 268.9\n(a)Represents contractual commitments to purchase coal, natural gas, uranium and other consumables as fuel for electric generation along with related transportation of the fuel.\nGUARANTEES\nLiabilities for guarantees are recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cGuarantees.\u201d There is no collateral held in relation to any guarantees. In the event any guarantee is drawn, there is no recourse to third-parties unless specified below.\nLetters of Credit (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas, APCo and I&M)\nStandby letters of credit are entered into with third-parties. These letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs, security deposits and debt service reserves.\nAEP has $4 billion and $1 billion revolving credit facilities due in March 2027 and 2025, respectively, under which up to $1.2 billion may be issued as letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, no letters of credit were issued under the revolving credit facility.\nAn uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. AEP issues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under six uncommitted facilities totaling $450 million. The Registrants\u2019 maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nIndemnifications and Other Guarantees\nContracts\nThe Registrants enter into certain types of contracts which require indemnifications. Typically these contracts include, but are not limited to, sale agreements, lease agreements, purchase agreements and financing agreements. Generally, these agreements may include, but are not limited to, indemnifications around certain tax, contractual and environmental matters. With respect to sale agreements, exposure generally does not exceed the sale price. As of December 31, 2023, there were no material liabilities recorded for any indemnifications.\nAEPSC conducts power purchase-and-sale activity on behalf of APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo, who are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted on their behalf. AEPSC also conducts power purchase-and-sale activity on behalf of PSO and SWEPCo, who are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted on their behalf.\nLease Obligations\nCertain Registrants lease equipment under master lease agreements. See \u201cMaster Lease Agreements\u201d section of Note 13 for additional information.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES (Applies to All Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation\nBy-products from the generation of electricity include materials such as ash, slag, sludge, low-level radioactive waste and SNF. Coal combustion by-products, which constitute the overwhelming percentage of these materials, are typically treated and deposited in captive disposal facilities or are beneficially utilized. In addition, the generation plants and transmission and distribution facilities have used asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and other hazardous and non-hazardous materials. The Registrants currently incur costs to dispose of these substances safely.\nSuperfund addresses clean-up of hazardous substances that are released to the environment. The Federal EPA administers the clean-up programs. Several states enacted similar laws. As of December 31, 2023, AGR, APCo, OPCo and SWEPCo are named as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) for one, one, two and one sites, respectively, by the Federal EPA for which alleged liability is unresolved. There are 11 additional sites for which APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo and SWEPCo received information requests which could lead to PRP designation. In those instances where a PRP or defendant has been named, disposal or recycling activities were in accordance with the then-applicable laws and regulations. Superfund does not recognize compliance as a defense, but imposes strict liability on parties who fall within its broad statutory categories. Liability has been resolved for a number of sites with no significant effect on net income.\nManagement evaluates the potential liability for each Superfund site separately, but several general statements can be made about potential future liability. Allegations that materials were disposed at a particular site are often unsubstantiated and the quantity of materials deposited at a site can be small and often non-hazardous. Although Superfund liability has been interpreted by the courts as joint and several, typically many parties are named as PRPs for each site and several of the parties are financially sound enterprises. As of December 31, 2023, management\u2019s estimates do not anticipate material clean-up costs for identified Superfund sites.\nNUCLEAR CONTINGENCIES (APPLIES TO AEP AND I&M)\nI&M owns and operates the two-unit 2,296 MW Cook Plant under licenses granted by the NRC. I&M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and to safely decommission and decontaminate the plant. The licenses to operate the two nuclear units at the Cook Plant expire in 2034 and 2037. Management is currently evaluating applying for license extensions for both units. The operation of a nuclear facility also involves special risks, potential liabilities and specific regulatory and safety requirements. By agreement, I&M is partially liable, together with all other electric utility companies that own nuclear generation units, for a nuclear power plant incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S. Should a nuclear incident occur at any nuclear power plant in the U.S., the resultant liability could be substantial.\nDecommissioning and Low-Level Waste Accumulation Disposal\nThe costs to decommission a nuclear plant are affected by NRC regulations and the SNF disposal program. Decommissioning costs are accrued over the service life of Cook Plant. The most recent decommissioning cost study was performed in 2021. According to that study, the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste was $2.2 billion in 2021 non-discounted dollars, with additional ongoing costs of $7 million per year for post decommissioning storage of SNF and an eventual cost of $33 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the SNF storage facility, also in 2021 non-discounted dollars. I&M recovers estimated decommissioning costs for the Cook Plant in its rates. The amounts recovered in rates were $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Decommissioning costs recovered from customers are deposited in external trusts.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total decommissioning trust fund balances were $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. The increase in the trust fund balance was driven by favorable investment performance in 2023. Trust fund earnings increase the fund assets and may decrease the amount remaining to be recovered from customers. Trust fund losses decrease the fund assets and may increase the amount remaining to be recovered from customers. The decommissioning costs (including unrealized gains and losses, interest and trust funds expenses) increase or decrease the recorded liability.\nI&M continues to work with regulators and customers to establish rates designed to collect the estimated costs of decommissioning the Cook Plant. However, future net income and cash flows would be reduced and financial condition could be impacted if the cost of SNF disposal and decommissioning increases and cannot be recovered.\nSpent Nuclear Fuel Disposal\nThe federal government is responsible for permanent SNF disposal and assesses fees to nuclear plant owners for SNF disposal. A fee of one-mill per KWh for fuel consumed after April 6, 1983 at the Cook Plant was collected from customers and remitted to the DOE through May 14, 2014. In May 2014, pursuant to court order from the U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the DOE adjusted the fee to $0. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, fees and related interest of $300 million and $286 million, respectively, for fuel consumed prior to April 7, 1983 were recorded as Long-term Debt and funds collected from customers along with related earnings totaling $348 million and $330 million, respectively, to pay the fee, were recorded as part of Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on the balance sheets. I&M has not paid the government the pre-April 1983 fees due to continued delays and uncertainties related to the federal disposal program.\nIn 2011, I&M signed a settlement agreement with the federal government which permits I&M to make annual filings to recover certain SNF storage costs incurred as a result of the government\u2019s delay in accepting SNF for permanent storage. Under the settlement agreement, I&M received $21 million, $3 million and $14 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to recover costs and will be eligible to receive additional payment of annual claims for allowed costs that are incurred through December 31, 2023. The proceeds reduced costs for dry cask storage. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, I&M deferred $12 million and $21 million, respectively, in Prepayments and Other Current Assets and $9 million and $3 million, respectively, in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets for dry cask storage and related operation and maintenance costs for recovery under this agreement. See \u201cFair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal\u201d section of Note 11 for additional information.\nNuclear Insurance\nI&M carries nuclear property insurance of $2.7 billion to cover a nuclear incident at Cook Plant including coverage for decontamination and stabilization, as well as premature decommissioning caused by a nuclear incident. Insurance coverage for a nonnuclear property incident at Cook Plant is $500 million. Additional insurance provides coverage for a weekly indemnity payment resulting from an insured accidental outage. I&M utilizes industry mutual insurers for the placement of this insurance coverage. Coverage from these industry mutual insurance programs require a contingent financial obligation of up to $42 million for I&M, which is assessable if the insurer\u2019s financial resources would be inadequate to pay for industry losses.\nThe Price-Anderson Act, extended through December 31, 2025, establishes insurance protection for public nuclear liability arising from a nuclear incident of $16.3 billion and applies to any incident at a licensed reactor in the U.S. Commercially available insurance, which must be carried for each licensed reactor, provides $500 million of primary coverage. In the event of a nuclear incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S., the remainder of the liability would be provided by a deferred premium assessment of $332 million per nuclear incident on Cook Plant\u2019s reactors payable in annual installments of $49 million. The number of incidents for which payments could be required is not limited.\nIn the event of an incident of a catastrophic nature, I&M is covered for public nuclear liability for the first $500 million through commercially available insurance. The next level of liability coverage of up to $15.8 billion would be covered by claim premium assessments made under the Price-Anderson Act. In the event nuclear losses or liabilities are underinsured or exceed accumulated funds, I&M would seek recovery of those amounts from customers through a rate increase. If recovery from customers is not possible, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nOPERATIONAL CONTINGENCIES\nInsurance and Potential Losses\nThe Registrants maintain insurance coverage normal and customary for electric utilities, subject to various deductibles. The Registrants also maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third-party injuries caused by cybersecurity incidents. Insurance coverage includes all risks of physical loss or damage to nonnuclear assets, subject to insurance policy conditions and exclusions. Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities and inventories. Excluded property generally includes transmission and distribution lines, poles and towers. The insurance programs also generally provide coverage against loss arising from certain claims made by third-parties and are in excess of retentions absorbed by the Registrants. Coverage is generally provided by a combination of the protected cell of EIS and/or various industry mutual and/or commercial insurance carriers. See \u201cNuclear Contingencies\u201d section above for additional information.\nSome potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities relating to a cybersecurity incident or damage to the Cook Plant and costs of replacement power in the event of an incident at the Cook Plant. Future losses or liabilities, if they occur, which are not completely insured, unless recovered from customers, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nLitigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6) (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nIn 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts and OVEC\u2019s coal-fired generating units. OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. After AEP learned of the criminal allegations against the Ohio legislator and others relating to HB 6, AEP, with assistance from outside advisors, conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the passage of the bill. Management does not believe that AEP was involved in any wrongful conduct in connection with the passage of HB 6.\nIn August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws. In December 2021, the district court issued an opinion and order dismissing the securities litigation complaint with prejudice, determining that the complaint failed to plead any actionable misrepresentations or omissions. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling.\nIn January 2021, an AEP shareholder filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio purporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In February 2021, a second AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. In April 2021, a third AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and a fourth AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Nassau County. These derivative complaints allege the officers and directors made misrepresentations and omissions similar to those alleged in the putative securities class action lawsuit filed against AEP. The derivative complaints together assert claims for: (a) breach of fiduciary duty, (b) waste of corporate assets, (c) unjust enrichment, (d) breach of duty for insider trading and (e) contribution for violations of sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and seek monetary damages and changes to AEP\u2019s corporate governance and internal policies among other forms of relief. The court entered a scheduling order in the New York state court derivative action staying the case other than with respect to briefing the motion to dismiss. AEP filed substantive and forum-based motions to dismiss in April 2022. In June 2022, the Ohio state court entered an order continuing the stays of that case until the final resolution of the consolidated derivative actions pending in Ohio federal district court. In September 2022, the New York state court granted the forum-based motion to dismiss with prejudice and the plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the New York appellate court. In January 2023, the New York plaintiff filed a motion to intervene in the pending Ohio federal court action and withdrew his appeal in New York. The two derivative actions pending in federal district court in Ohio have been consolidated and the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed an amended complaint. AEP filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and subsequently filed a brief in opposition to the New York plaintiffs\u2019 motion to intervene in the consolidated action in Ohio. In March 2023, the federal district court issued an order granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denying the New York plaintiffs\u2019 motion to intervene. In April 2023, one of the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of the Ohio federal district court order dismissing the consolidated action and denying the intervention. The defendants will continue to defend against the claims. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn March 2021, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing a purported AEP shareholder. The litigation demand letter was directed to the Board of Directors of AEP (AEP Board) and contained factual allegations involving HB 6 that were generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The shareholder that sent the letter has since withdrawn the litigation demand, which is now terminated and of no further effect. In April 2023, AEP received a litigation demand from counsel representing the purported AEP shareholder who filed the dismissed derivative action in New York state court and unsuccessfully tried to intervene in the consolidated derivative actions in Ohio federal court. The litigation demand letter is directed to the AEP Board and contains factual allegations involving HB 6 that are generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The letter demands, among other things, that the AEP Board undertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations by certain current and former directors and officers, and that AEP commence a civil action for breaches of fiduciary duty and related claims against any individuals who allegedly harmed AEP. The AEP Board considered the 2023 litigation demand letter and formed a committee of the Board (the \u201cDemand Review Committee\u201d) to investigate, review, monitor and analyze the allegations in the letter and make a recommendation to the\nAEP Board regarding a reasonable and appropriate response to the same. The AEP Board will act in response to the letter as appropriate. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nIn May 2021, AEP received a subpoena from the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement seeking various documents, including documents relating to the passage of HB 6 and documents relating to AEP\u2019s policies and financial processes and controls. In August 2022, AEP received a second subpoena from the SEC seeking various additional documents relating to its ongoing investigation. AEP is cooperating fully with the SEC\u2019s investigation, which has included taking testimony from certain individuals and inquiries regarding Empowering Ohio\u2019s Economy, Inc., which is a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, and related disclosures. The SEC staff has advanced its discussions with certain parties involved in the investigation, including AEP, concerning the staff\u2019s intentions regarding potential claims under the securities laws. AEP and the SEC are engaged in discussions about a possible resolution of the SEC\u2019s investigation and potential claims under the securities laws. Any resolution or filed claims, the outcome of which cannot be predicted, may subject AEP to civil penalties and other remedial measures. Discussions are continuing and management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring, but management does not believe the results of this investigation or a possible resolution thereof will have a material impact on results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nClaims for Indemnification Made by Owners of the Gavin Power Station (Applies to AEP)\nIn November 2022, the Federal EPA issued a final decision denying Gavin Power LLC\u2019s requested extension to allow a CCR surface impoundment at the Gavin Power Station to continue to receive CCR and non-CCR waste streams after April 11, 2021 until May 4, 2023 (the Gavin Denial). As part of the Gavin Denial, the Federal EPA made several assertions related to the CCR Rule (see \u201cEnvironmental Issues - CCR Rule\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information), including an assertion that the closure of the 300 acre unlined fly ash reservoir (FAR) is noncompliant with the CCR Rule in multiple respects. The Gavin Power Station was formerly owned and operated by AEP and was sold to Gavin Power LLC and Lightstone Generation LLC in 2017. Pursuant to the PSA, AEP maintained responsibility to complete closure of the FAR in accordance with the closure plan approved by the Ohio EPA which was completed in July 2021. The PSA contains indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the owners of the Gavin Power Station have notified AEP they believe they are entitled to indemnification for any damages that may result from these claims, including any future enforcement or litigation resulting from any determinations of noncompliance by the Federal EPA with various aspects of the CCR Rule consistent with the Gavin Denial. The owners of the Gavin Power Station have also sought indemnification for landowner claims for property damage allegedly caused by modifications to the FAR. Management does not believe that the owners of the Gavin Power Station have any valid claim for indemnity or otherwise against AEP under the PSA. In addition, Gavin Power LLC, several AEP subsidiaries, and other parties have filed Petitions for Review of the Gavin Denial with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring. Gavin Power LLC has also filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging various violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and asserting that the Federal EPA, through its prior inaction, has waived and is estopped from raising certain objections raised in the Gavin Denial. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation.\n7. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND IMPAIRMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP unless indicated otherwise.\nACQUISITIONS\nDry Lake Solar Project (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn March 2021, AEP acquired a 75% ownership interest in the Dry Lake Solar Project located in southern Nevada for approximately $114 million and the project was placed in-service in May 2021. In August 2023, Dry Lake was included in the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio. See the \u201cDisposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio\u201d section below and Note 17 - Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information.\nNorth Central Wind Energy Facilities (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo)\nIn 2020, PSO and SWEPCo received regulatory approvals to acquire the NCWF, comprised of three Oklahoma wind facilities totaling 1,484 MWs, on a fixed cost turn-key basis. PSO and SWEPCo own undivided interests of 45.5% and 54.5% of the NCWF, respectively. In total, the three wind facilities cost approximately $2 billion and consist of Traverse (998 MW), Maverick (287 MW) and Sundance (199 MW). Output from the NCWF serves retail load in PSO\u2019s Oklahoma service territory and both retail and FERC wholesale load in SWEPCo\u2019s service territories in Arkansas and Louisiana. The Oklahoma and Louisiana portions of the NCWF revenue requirement, net of PTC benefit, are recoverable through authorized riders until the amounts are reflected in base rates. Recovery of the Arkansas portion of the NCWF revenue requirement through base rates was approved by the APSC in May 2022. The NCWF are subject to various regulatory performance requirements. If these performance requirements are not met, PSO and SWEPCo would recognize a regulatory liability to refund retail customers.\nIn April 2021, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Sundance during its development and construction for $270 million. Sundance was placed in-service in April 2021. In September 2021, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Maverick during its development and construction for $383 million. Maverick was placed in-service in September 2021. In March 2022, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Traverse during its development and construction for $1.2 billion. Traverse was placed in-service in March 2022. Immediately following the acquisitions, PSO and SWEPCo liquidated the entities and simultaneously distributed the assets in proportion to their undivided ownership interests. PSO and SWEPCo apply the joint plant accounting model to account for their respective undivided interests in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the NCWF projects.\nRock Falls Wind Facility (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and PSO)\nIn November 2022, PSO entered into an agreement to acquire the Rock Falls Wind Facility. In February 2023, the FERC approved PSO\u2019s acquisition of the Rock Falls Wind Facility under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. In March 2023, PSO acquired an ownership interest in the entity that owned Rock Falls during its development and construction for $146 million. In accordance with the guidance for \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d AEP management determined that the acquisition of the Rock Falls Wind Facility represents an asset acquisition. The lease obligations related to Rock Falls were not material at the time of acquisition. See the \u201c2022 Oklahoma Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\nDISPOSITIONS\nTermination of Planned Disposition of KPCo and KTCo (Vertically Integrated Utilities and AEP Transmission Holdco Segments) (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)\nIn October 2021, AEP entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) to sell KPCo and KTCo to Liberty Utilities Co., a subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (Liberty), for approximately a $2.85 billion enterprise value. The SPA was subsequently amended in September 2022 to reduce the purchase price to approximately $2.646 billion. The sale required approval from the KPSC and from the FERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. The SPA contained certain termination rights if the closing of the sale did not occur by April 26, 2023.\nIn May 2022, the KPSC approved the sale of KPCo to Liberty subject to certain conditions contingent upon the closing of the sale. In December 2022, the FERC issued an order denying, without prejudice, authorization of the proposed sale stating the applicants failed to demonstrate the proposed transaction will not have an adverse effect on rates. In February 2023, a new filing for approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act was submitted. In March 2023, the KPSC and other intervenors made filings recommending the FERC reject AEP and Liberty\u2019s new Section 203 application seeking approval of the sale.\nAs a result of delays in the anticipated timing of the closing of the transaction and other factors, AEP recorded a $363 million pretax loss on the expected sale of the Kentucky Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. In April 2023, AEP, AEPTCo and Liberty entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement (Termination Agreement) terminating the SPA. The parties entered into the Termination Agreement as all of the conditions precedent to closing the sale could not be satisfied prior to April 26, 2023. Upon termination of the sale and reverting to a held and used model, in the first quarter of 2023, AEP reversed $28 million of expected transaction costs included in the $363 million pretax loss and was required to present its investment in the Kentucky Operations at the lower of fair value or historical carrying value which resulted in a $335 million reduction recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment. The reduced investment in KPCo\u2019s assets is being amortized over the 30-year average useful life of the KPCo assets.\nDisposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn February 2022, AEP management announced the initiation of a process to sell all or a portion of AEP Renewables\u2019 competitive contracted renewables portfolio (the portfolio) within the Generation & Marketing segment. In late January 2023, AEP received final bids from interested parties. In February 2023, AEP\u2019s Board of Directors approved management\u2019s plan to sell the portfolio and AEP signed an agreement with a nonaffiliated party.\nIn August 2023, AEP completed the sale of the entire portfolio to the nonaffiliated party and received cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, net of taxes and transaction costs. AEP recorded a pretax loss of $93 million ($73 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the sale.\nDisposition of Mineral Rights (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn June 2022, AEP closed on the sale of certain mineral rights to a nonaffiliated third-party and received $120 million of proceeds. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $116 million in the second quarter of 2022.\nIMPAIRMENTS\n2012 Texas Base Rate Case (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn December 2023, SWEPCo recorded a pretax, non-cash disallowance of $86 million in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statements of income due to regulatory disallowance of recovery of AFUDC on Turk Plant in the 2012 Texas Base Rate case. See the \u201c2012 Texas Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\nNMRD (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn December 2023, as a result of sale negotiations AEP determined a decline in the fair value of AEP\u2019s investment in New Mexico Renewable Development (NMRD) was other than temporary. In accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cInvestment - Equity Method and Joint Ventures\u201d, in the fourth quarter of 2023 AEP recorded a pretax other than temporary impairment charge of $19 million which is presented in Equity Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on AEP\u2019s Statement of Income. AEP\u2019s determination of fair value utilized the accounting guidance for Fair Value Measurement market approach to valuation and was based on negotiations to sell the investment to a non-affiliate. The carrying value of the investment in NMRD was not material to AEP as of December 31, 2023.\nFlat Ridge 2 Wind LLC (Generation & Marketing Segment) (Applies to AEP)\nIn 2019, AEP acquired a 50% ownership interest in five non-consolidated joint ventures, including Flat Ridge 2 Wind LLC (Flat Ridge 2), and two tax equity partnerships. The five non-consolidated joint ventures are jointly owned and operated by BP Wind Energy. Flat Ridge 2 sells electricity to three counterparties through long-term PPAs.\nRegarding AEP\u2019s investment in Flat Ridge 2, in June 2022, as a result of Flat Ridge 2\u2019s deteriorating financial performance, sale negotiations and AEP\u2019s ongoing evaluation and ultimate decision to exit the investment in the near term, AEP determined a decline in the fair value of AEP\u2019s investment in Flat Ridge 2 was other than temporary. In accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cInvestments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures\u201d, in the second quarter of 2022 AEP recorded a pretax other than temporary impairment charge of $186 million which is presented in Equity Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on AEP\u2019s Statement of Income. AEP\u2019s determination of fair value utilized the accounting guidance for Fair Value Measurement market approach to valuation and was based on negotiations to sell the investment to a non-affiliate. In the third quarter of 2022, AEP recorded an additional $2 million pretax other than temporary impairment charge which is presented in Equity Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries on AEP\u2019s Statement of Income. In September 2022, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement with a nonaffiliate for AEP\u2019s interest in Flat Ridge 2. The transaction closed in the fourth quarter of 2022 and had an immaterial impact on the financial statements at closing.\n2020 Texas Base Rate Case (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nIn January 2022, the PUCT issued a final order which included a return of investment only for the recovery of the Dolet Hills Power Station. As a result of the final order, SWEPCo recorded a disallowance of $12 million associated with the lack of return on the Dolet Hills Power Station. In February 2022, SWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT challenging denial of a reasonable return or carrying costs on the Dolet Hills Power Station among other items. In April 2022, the PUCT denied the motion for rehearing. In May 2022, SWEPCo filed a petition for review with the Texas District Court seeking a judicial review of the several errors challenged in the PUCT\u2019s final order. See \u201c2020 Texas Base Rate Case\u201d section of Note 4 for additional information.\n8. BENEFIT PLANS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except AEPTCo unless indicated otherwise.\nFor a discussion of investment strategy, investment limitations, target asset allocations and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy, see \u201cFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities\u201d and \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d sections of Note 1.\nAEPSC sponsors a qualified pension plan and two unfunded non-qualified pension plans. Substantially all AEP subsidiary employees are covered by the qualified plan or both the qualified and a non-qualified pension plan. AEPSC also sponsors OPEB plans to provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees.\nDue to the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 participation in AEP\u2019s benefit plans, the assumptions used by the actuary, with the exception of the rate of compensation increase, and the accounting for the plans by each subsidiary are the same. This section details the assumptions that apply to all Registrants and the rate of compensation increase for each Registrant.\nThe Registrants recognize the funded status associated with defined benefit pension and OPEB plans on the balance sheets. Disclosures about the plans are required by the \u201cCompensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d accounting guidance. The Registrants recognize an asset for a plan\u2019s overfunded status or a liability for a plan\u2019s underfunded status, and recognize, as a component of other comprehensive income, the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year that are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The Registrants record a regulatory asset instead of other comprehensive income for qualifying benefit costs of regulated operations that for rate-making purposes are deferred for future recovery. The cumulative funded status adjustment is equal to the remaining unrecognized deferrals for unamortized actuarial losses or gains, prior service costs and transition obligations, such that remaining deferred costs result in an AOCI equity reduction or regulatory asset and deferred gains result in an AOCI equity addition or regulatory liability.\nActuarial Assumptions for Benefit Obligations\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the Registrants\u2019 benefit obligations are shown in the following tables:\nPension Plans OPEB\nDecember 31,\nAssumption 2023 2022 2023 2022\nDiscount Rate 5.15 % 5.50 % 5.15 % 5.50 %\nInterest Crediting Rate 4.00 % 4.25 % NA NA\nNA Not applicable.\nAssumption - Rate of Compensation Increase (a) - Pension Plans\nAEP AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\nDecember 31, 2023 5.05 % 5.20 % 4.95 % 5.05 % 5.45 % 5.20 % 5.00 %\nDecember 31, 2022 5.05 % 5.15 % 4.90 % 5.00 % 5.35 % 5.15 % 5.00 %\n(a)Rates are for base pay only. In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and overtime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees.\nA duration-based method is used to determine the discount rate for the plans. A hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds is constructed with cash flows matching the benefit plan liability. The composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio is used as the discount rate for the plan. The discount rate is the same for each Registrant.\nFor 2023, the rate of compensation increase assumed varies with the age of the employee, ranging from 3% per year to 11.5% per year, with the average increase shown in the table above. The compensation increase rates reflect variations in each Registrants\u2019 population participating in the pension plan.\nActuarial Assumptions for Net Periodic Benefit Costs\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of each Registrants\u2019 benefit costs are shown in the following tables:\nNA Not applicable.\n(a)Rates are for base pay only. In addition, an amount is added to reflect target incentive compensation for exempt employees and overtime and incentive pay for nonexempt employees.\nThe expected return on plan assets was determined by evaluating historical returns, the current investment climate (yield on fixed income securities and other recent investment market indicators), rate of inflation, third-party forecasts and current prospects for economic growth. The expected return on plan assets is the same for each Registrant.\nThe health care trend rate assumptions used for OPEB plans measurement purposes are shown below:\nSignificant Concentrations of Risk within Plan Assets\nIn addition to establishing the target asset allocation of plan assets, the investment policy also places restrictions on securities to limit significant concentrations within plan assets. The investment policy establishes guidelines that govern maximum market exposure, security restrictions, prohibited asset classes, prohibited types of transactions, minimum credit quality, average portfolio credit quality, portfolio duration and concentration limits. The guidelines were established to mitigate the risk of loss due to significant concentrations in any investment. Management monitors the plans to control security diversification and ensure compliance with the investment policy. As of December 31, 2023, the assets were invested in compliance with all investment limits. See \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1 for limit details.\nBenefit Plan Obligations, Plan Assets, Funded Status and Amounts Recognized on the Balance Sheets\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the pension plans had an actuarial loss primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate, and to a lesser extent the effect of demographic experience (updated census data on January 1, 2023). These losses were partially offset by decreasing the cash balance account interest crediting rate. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the OPEB plans had an actuarial loss primarily due to discount rates, as well as actual net benefit payments above expected. These losses were partially offset by updated per capita cost assumptions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the pension plans had an actuarial gain primarily due to an increase in the discount rate and was partially offset by increases in the assumed lump sum conversion rate and cash balance account interest crediting rate. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the OPEB plans had an actuarial gain primarily due to an increase in the discount rate and updated per capita cost assumptions. The OPEB plans gains were partially offset by a projected reduction in the Employer Group Waiver Program catastrophic reinsurance offset provided to AEP, resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act as well as an increase in the health care cost trend assumption. The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the plans\u2019 benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, funded status and the presentation on the balance sheets. The benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation, respectively.\nPension Plans\n(a)No contributions were made to the qualified pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Contributions to the non-qualified pension plans were $8 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOPEB\nAmounts Included on the Balance Sheets Related to Funded Status\nPension Plans\nOPEB\nAmounts Included in Regulatory Assets, Deferred Income Taxes and AOCI\nThe following tables show the components of the plans included in Regulatory Assets, Deferred Income Taxes and AOCI and the items attributable to the change in these components:\nPension Plans\nOPEB\nDetermination of Pension Expense\nThe determination of pension expense or income is based on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return.\nPension and OPEB Assets\nThe fair value tables within Pension and OPEB Assets present the classification of assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy. All Level 1, 2, 3 and Other amounts can be allocated to the Registrant Subsidiaries using the percentages in the table below:\nThe following table presents the classification of pension plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023:\n(a)Includes investment securities loaned to borrowers under the securities lending program. See the \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1 for additional information.\n(b)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per-share.\n(c)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement.\nThe following table presents the classification of OPEB plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023:\n(a)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per-share.\n(b)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement.\nThe following table presents the classification of pension plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022:\n(a)Includes investment securities loaned to borrowers under the securities lending program. See the \u201cInvestments Held in Trust for Future Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1 for additional information.\n(b)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per-share.\n(c)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement.\nThe following table presents the classification of OPEB plan assets for AEP within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022:\n(a)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column represent investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per-share.\n(b)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent accrued interest, dividend receivables and transactions pending settlement.\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans is as follows:\nObligations in Excess of Fair Values\nThe tables below show the underfunded pension plans that had obligations in excess of plan assets.\nProjected Benefit Obligation\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments and Contributions\nThe estimated pension benefit payments and contributions to the trust are at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act plus payment of unfunded non-qualified benefits. For the qualified pension plan, additional discretionary contributions may also be made to maintain the funded status of the plan. For OPEB plans, expected payments include the payment of unfunded benefits. The following table provides the estimated contributions and payments by Registrant for 2024:\nAEP AEP Texas APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nPension Plans $ 6.7 $ 0.3 $ - $ - $ - $ 0.1 $ 0.1\nOPEB 3.0 - 1.6 - - - -\nThe tables below reflect the total benefits expected to be paid from the plan or from the Registrants\u2019 assets. The payments include the participants\u2019 contributions to the plan for their share of the cost. Future benefit payments are dependent on the number of employees retiring, whether the retiring employees elect to receive pension benefits as annuities or as lump sum distributions, future integration of the benefit plans with changes to Medicare and other legislation, future levels of interest rates and variances in actuarial results. The estimated payments for the pension benefits and OPEB are as follows:\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost\nThe following tables provide the components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) by Registrant for the plans:\nPension Plans\nOPEB\nAmerican Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan\nAEPSC sponsors the American Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan, a defined contribution retirement savings plan for substantially all AEP subsidiary employees who are not covered by a retirement savings plan of the UMWA. This qualified plan offers participants an opportunity to contribute a portion of their pay, includes features under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and provides for company matching contributions. The matching contributions to the plan are 100% of the first 1% of eligible employee contributions and 70% of the next 5% of contributions.\nThe following table provides the cost for matching contributions to the retirement savings plans by Registrant:\nUMWA Benefits\nHealth and Welfare Benefits (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nAEP provides health and welfare benefits negotiated with the UMWA for certain unionized employees, retirees and their survivors who meet eligibility requirements. APCo also provides the same UMWA health and welfare benefits for certain unionized mining retirees and their survivors who meet eligibility requirements. AEP and APCo administer the health and welfare benefits and pay them from their general assets.\nMultiemployer Pension Benefits (Applies to AEP)\nUMWA pension benefits are provided through the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan (Employer Identification Number: 52-1050282, Plan Number 002), a multiemployer plan. The UMWA pension benefits are administered by a board of trustees appointed in equal numbers by the UMWA and the Bituminous Coal Operators\u2019 Association (BCOA), an industry bargaining association. AEP makes contributions to the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan based on provisions in its labor agreement and the plan documents. The UMWA pension plan is different from single-employer plans as an employer\u2019s contributions may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. A withdrawing employer may be subject to a withdrawal liability, which is calculated based upon that employer\u2019s share of the plan\u2019s unfunded benefit obligations. If an employer fails to make required contributions or if its payments in connection with its withdrawal liability fall short of satisfying its share of the plan\u2019s unfunded benefit obligations, the remaining employers may be allocated a greater share of the remaining unfunded plan obligations. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), the UMWA pension plan is in Critical Status for the plan year beginning July 1, 2023 and was in Critical Status for the plan year beginning July 1, 2022. As required under the PPA, the Plan adopted a Rehabilitation Plan in 2015. The Rehabilitation Plan has been updated annually, most recently in April 2023.\nAEP affiliates contributed $396 thousand, $329 thousand and $339 thousand to the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The contributions did not include surcharges. An AEP affiliate, Cook Coal Terminal (CCT), was listed in the plan\u2019s 2021 Form 5500 as providing more than 5 percent of the total contributions for the plan year ending June 30, 2022. The plan\u2019s 2022 Form 5500 is expected to be filed in the second quarter of 2024.\nUnder the terms of the UMWA pension plan, contributions will be required to continue beyond the January 25, 2025 expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement between the CCT facility and the UMWA, whether or not the term of that agreement is extended or a subsequent agreement is entered, so long as both the UMWA pension plan remains in effect and an AEP affiliate continues to operate the facility covered by the current collective bargaining agreement. The contribution rate applicable would be determined in accordance with the terms of the UMWA pension plan by reference to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement, subject to periodic revisions, between the UMWA and the BCOA. If the UMWA pension plan would terminate or an AEP affiliate would cease operation of the facility without arranging for a successor operator to assume its liability, the withdrawal liability obligation would be triggered.\nAEP records a UMWA pension withdrawal liability on the balance sheet that is re-measured annually and is the estimated value of the company\u2019s anticipated contributions toward its proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the liability balance was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. AEP recovers the estimated value of its UMWA pension withdrawal liability through fuel clauses in certain regulated jurisdictions. AEP records a regulatory asset on the balance sheets when the UMWA pension withdrawal liability exceeds the cumulative billings collected and a regulatory liability on the balance sheets when the cumulative billings collected exceed the withdrawal liability. If any portion of the UMWA pension withdrawal liability is not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\n9. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nAEP\u2019s Reportable Segments\nAEP\u2019s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements.\nAEP\u2019s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below:\nVertically Integrated Utilities\n\u2022Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.\nTransmission and Distribution Utilities\n\u2022Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo.\n\u2022OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve standard service offer customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load.\nAEP Transmission Holdco\n\u2022Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEPTCo. These investments have FERC-approved ROEs.\n\u2022Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP\u2019s transmission-only joint ventures. These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved ROEs.\nGeneration & Marketing\n\u2022Contracted energy management services.\n\u2022Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, MISO, PJM and SPP.\n\u2022Competitive generation in PJM.\nThe remainder of AEP\u2019s activities are presented as Corporate and Other. While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent\u2019s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense, income tax expense and other nonallocated costs.\nAEP\u2019s Chief Operating Decision Maker makes operating decisions, allocates resources to and assesses performance based on these operating segments. AEP measures segment profit or loss based on net income (loss). Net income (loss) includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, direct interest expense and income taxes are included in net income (loss).\nThe tables below present AEP\u2019s reportable segment income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and reportable segment balance sheet information as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(a)Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries. This segment also includes Parent\u2019s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income, interest expense and other nonallocated costs.\n(b)Represents inter-segment revenues.\n(c)Includes elimination of AEP Parent\u2019s investments in wholly-owned subsidiary companies.\n(d)Reconciling Adjustments for Total Assets primarily include elimination of intercompany advances to affiliates and intercompany accounts receivable.\nRegistrant Subsidiaries\u2019 Reportable Segments (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrant Subsidiaries each have one reportable segment, an integrated electricity generation, transmission and distribution business for APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo, and an integrated electricity transmission and distribution business for AEP Texas and OPCo. Other activities are insignificant. The Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 operations are managed on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost structures and operating results.\nAEPTCo\u2019s Reportable Segments\nAEPTCo Parent is the holding company of seven FERC-regulated transmission-only electric utilities. The seven State Transcos have been identified as operating segments of AEPTCo under the accounting guidance for \u201cSegment Reporting.\u201d The State Transcos business consists of developing, constructing and operating transmission facilities at the request of the RTOs in which they operate and in replacing and upgrading facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP transmission system as needed to maintain reliability standards and provide service to AEP\u2019s wholesale and retail customers. The State Transcos are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems.\nAEPTCo\u2019s Chief Operating Decision Maker makes operating decisions, allocates resources to and assesses performance-based on these operating segments. The State Transcos operating segments all have similar economic characteristics and meet all of the criteria under the accounting guidance for \u201cSegment Reporting\u201d to be aggregated into one operating segment. As a result, AEPTCo has one reportable segment. The remainder of AEPTCo\u2019s activity is presented in AEPTCo Parent. While not considered a reportable segment, AEPTCo Parent represents the activity of the holding company which primarily relates to debt financing activity and general corporate activities.\nThe tables below present AEPTCo\u2019s reportable segment income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and reportable segment balance sheet information as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(a) Elimination of intercompany interest income/interest expense on affiliated debt arrangement.\n(b) Includes elimination of AEPTCo Parent\u2019s equity earnings in the State Transcos.\n(c) Primarily relates to Notes Receivable from the State Transcos.\n(d) Primarily relates to elimination of Notes Receivable from the State Transcos.\n10. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. For the periods presented, AEPTCo did not have any derivative and hedging activity.\nOBJECTIVES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nAEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of certain AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries. AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries.\nThe Registrants are exposed to certain market risks as major power producers and participants in the electricity, capacity, natural gas, coal and emission allowance markets. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact the Registrants due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. Management utilizes derivative instruments to manage these risks.\nSTRATEGIES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES\nRisk Management Strategies\nThe strategy surrounding the use of derivative instruments primarily focuses on managing risk exposures, future cash flows and creating value utilizing both economic and formal hedging strategies. The risk management strategies also include the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes which focus on seizing market opportunities to create value driven by expected changes in the market prices of the commodities. To accomplish these objectives, the Registrants primarily employ risk management contracts including physical and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options. Not all risk management contracts meet the definition of a derivative under the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d Derivative risk management contracts elected normal under the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception are not subject to the requirements of this accounting guidance.\nThe Registrants utilize power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business. The Registrants utilize interest rate derivative contracts in order to manage the interest rate exposure associated with the commodity portfolio. For disclosure purposes, such risks are grouped as \u201cCommodity,\u201d as these risks are related to energy risk management activities. The Registrants also utilize derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk associated with debt financing. For disclosure purposes, these risks are grouped as \u201cInterest Rate.\u201d The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe following table represents the gross notional volume of the Registrants\u2019 outstanding derivative contracts:\nFair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP)\nParent enters into interest rate derivative transactions as part of an overall strategy to manage the mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. Certain interest rate derivative transactions effectively modify exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of fixed-rate debt to a floating-rate. Provided specific criteria are met, these interest rate derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges.\nCash Flow Hedging Strategies\nThe Registrants utilize cash flow hedges on certain derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of power (\u201cCommodity\u201d) in order to manage the variable price risk related to forecasted purchases and sales. Management monitors the potential impacts of commodity price changes and, where appropriate, enters into derivative transactions to protect profit margins for a portion of future electricity sales and purchases. The Registrants do not hedge all commodity price risk.\nThe Registrants utilize a variety of interest rate derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate risk exposure. The Registrants also utilize interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate exposure related to future borrowings of fixed-rate debt. The Registrants do not hedge all interest rate exposure.\nACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d requires recognition of all qualifying derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets at fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments accounted for using MTM accounting or hedge accounting are based on exchange prices and broker quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes and other assumptions. In order to determine the relevant fair values of the derivative instruments, the Registrants apply valuation adjustments for discounting, liquidity and credit quality.\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform on the contract or fail to pay amounts due. Liquidity risk represents the risk that imperfections in the market will cause the price to vary from estimated fair value based upon prevailing market supply and demand conditions. Since energy markets are imperfect and volatile, there are inherent risks related to the underlying assumptions in models used to fair value risk management contracts. Unforeseen events may cause reasonable price curves to differ from actual price curves throughout a contract\u2019s term and at the time a contract settles. Consequently, there could be significant adverse or favorable effects on future net income and cash flows if market prices are not consistent with management\u2019s estimates of current market consensus for forward prices in the current period. This is particularly true for longer term contracts. Cash flows may vary based on market conditions, margin requirements and the timing of settlement of risk management contracts.\nAccording to the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging,\u201d the Registrants reflect the fair values of derivative instruments subject to netting agreements with the same counterparty net of related cash collateral. For certain risk management contracts, the Registrants are required to post or receive cash collateral based on third-party contractual agreements and risk profiles. AEP netted cash collateral received from third-parties against short-term and long-term risk management assets in the amounts of $46 million and $481 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There was no cash collateral received from third-parties netted against short-term and long-term risk management assets for the Registrant Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amount of cash collateral paid to third-parties netted against short-term and long-term risk management liabilities was not material for the Registrants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLocation and Fair Value of Derivative Assets and Liabilities Recognized In the Balance Sheet\nThe following tables represent the gross fair value of the Registrants\u2019 derivative activity on the balance sheets. The derivative instruments are disclosed as gross. They are subject to master netting agreements and are presented on the balance sheets on a net basis in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d Unless shown as a separate line on the balance sheets due to materiality, Current Risk Management Assets are included in Prepayments and Other Current Assets, Long-term Risk Management Assets are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets, Current Risk Management Liabilities are included in Other Current Liabilities and Long-term Risk Management Liabilities are included in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets.\nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables show the net amounts of assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheets. The gross amounts offset include counterparty netting of risk management and hedging contracts and associated cash collateral in accordance with accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d All derivative contracts subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement are offset on the balance sheets.\nThe tables below present the Registrants\u2019 amount of gain (loss) recognized on risk management contracts:\nAmount of Gain (Loss) Recognized on Risk Management Contracts\n(a)Represents realized and unrealized gains and losses subject to regulatory accounting treatment recorded as either current or noncurrent on the balance sheets.\nCertain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts, as provided in the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under that accounting guidance are not subject to MTM accounting treatment and are recognized on the statements of income on an accrual basis.\nThe accounting for the changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. Depending on the exposure, management designates a hedging instrument as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\nFor contracts that have not been designated as part of a hedging relationship, the accounting for changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative instrument is held for trading purposes. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments held for trading purposes are included in revenues on a net basis on the statements of income. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments not held for trading purposes are included in revenues or expenses on the statements of income depending on the relevant facts and circumstances. Certain derivatives that economically hedge future commodity risk are recorded in the same line item on the statements of income as that of the associated risk being hedged. However, unrealized and some realized gains and losses in regulated jurisdictions for both trading and non-trading derivative instruments are recorded as regulatory assets (for losses) or regulatory liabilities (for gains) in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations.\u201d\nAccounting for Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP)\nFor fair value hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or an identified portion thereof attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk impacts net income during the period of change.\nAEP records realized and unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting treatment and any offsetting changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nThe following table shows the impacts recognized on the balance sheets related to the hedged items in fair value hedging relationships:\nCarrying Amount of the Hedged Liabilities Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Included in the Carrying Amount of the Hedged Liabilities\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(in millions)\nLong-term Debt (a) (b) $ (878.2) $ (855.5) $ 68.4 $ 89.7\n(a)Amounts included within Noncurrent Liabilities line item Long-term Debt on the Balance Sheet.\n(b)Amounts include $(30) million and $(38) million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for the fair value hedge adjustment of hedged debt obligations for which hedge accounting has been discontinued.\nThe pretax effects of fair value hedge accounting on income were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nGain (Loss) on Interest Rate Contracts:\nFair Value Hedging Instruments (a) $ 29.0 $ (90.4) $ (35.5)\nFair Value Portion of Long-term Debt (a) (29.0) 90.4 35.5\n(a)Gain (Loss) is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nAccounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nFor cash flow hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the Registrants initially report the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets until the period the hedged item affects net income.\nRealized gains and losses on derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of power designated as cash flow hedges are included in Total Revenues or Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation on the statements of income or in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets, depending on the specific nature of the risk being hedged. During the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives and the Registrant Subsidiaries did not.\nThe Registrants reclassify gains and losses on interest rate derivative hedges related to debt financings from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Interest Expense on the statements of income in those periods in which hedged interest payments occur. During the year ended 2023, AEP, AEP Texas, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives and the other Registrant Subsidiaries did not. During the year ended 2022, AEP and PSO applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives. During the year ended 2021, AEP and APCo applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives.\nFor details on effective cash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets and the reasons for changes in cash flow hedges, see Note 3 - Comprehensive Income.\nCash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets were:\nAs of December 31, 2023 the maximum length of time that AEP is hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows related to forecasted transactions is 87 months.\nThe actual amounts reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Net Income can differ from the estimate above due to market price changes.\nCredit Risk\nManagement mitigates credit risk in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis.\nMaster agreements are typically used to facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty and may include collateral requirements. Collateral requirements in the form of cash, letters of credit and parental/affiliate guarantees may be obtained as security from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk. Some master agreements include margining, which requires a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit in the event exposure exceeds the established threshold. The threshold represents an unsecured credit limit which may be supported by a parental/affiliate guaranty, as determined in accordance with AEP\u2019s credit policy. In addition, master agreements allow for termination and liquidation of all positions in the event of a default including a failure or inability to post collateral when required.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\nCredit Downgrade Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nA limited number of derivative contracts include collateral triggering events, which include a requirement to maintain certain credit ratings. On an ongoing basis, AEP\u2019s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these collateral triggering events in contracts. The Registrants have not experienced a downgrade below a specified credit rating threshold that would require the posting of additional collateral. AEP had derivative contracts with collateral triggering events in a net liability position with a total exposure of $0 and $2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Registrant Subsidiaries had no derivative contracts with collateral triggering events in a net liability position as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCross-Acceleration Triggers\nCertain interest rate derivative contracts contain cross-acceleration provisions that, if triggered, would permit the counterparty to declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable. These cross-acceleration provisions could be triggered if there was a non-performance event by the Registrants under any of their outstanding debt of at least $50 million and the lender on that debt has accelerated the entire repayment obligation. On an ongoing basis, AEP\u2019s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these cross-acceleration provisions in contracts. AEP had derivative contracts with cross-acceleration provisions in a net liability position of $107 million and $127 million and no cash collateral posted as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If a cross-acceleration provision would have been triggered, settlement at fair value would have been required. The Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 derivative contracts with cross-acceleration provisions outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nCross-Default Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCo)\nIn addition, a majority of non-exchange traded commodity contracts contain cross-default provisions that, if triggered, would permit the counterparty to declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable. These cross-default provisions could be triggered if there was a non-performance event by Parent or the obligor under outstanding debt or a third-party obligation that is $50 million or greater. On an ongoing basis, AEP\u2019s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these cross-default provisions in the contracts. AEP had derivative contracts with cross-default provisions in a net liability position of $242 million and $217 million and no cash collateral posted as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, after considering contractual netting arrangements. If a cross-default provision would have been triggered, settlement at fair value would have been required. APCo, PSO and SWEPCo had derivative contracts with cross-default provisions in a net liability position of $22 million, $29 million and $15 million, respectively, and no cash collateral posted as of December 31, 2023. The other Registrant Subsidiaries had no derivative contracts with cross-default provisions outstanding as of December 31, 2023. The Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 derivative contracts with cross-default provisions outstanding as of December 31, 2022 were not material.\n11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants except AEPTCo unless indicated otherwise.\nFair Value Measurements of Long-term Debt (Applies to all Registrants)\nThe fair values of Long-term Debt are based on quoted market prices, without credit enhancements, for the same or similar issues and the current interest rates offered for instruments with similar maturities classified as Level 2 measurement inputs. These instruments are not marked-to-market. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. The fair value of AEP\u2019s Equity Units (Level 1) are valued based on publicly-traded securities issued by AEP.\nThe book values and fair values of Long-term Debt are summarized in the following table:\n(a)The fair value amounts include debt related to AEP\u2019s Equity Units and had a fair value of $0 million and $877 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See \u201cEquity Units\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information.\nFair Value Measurements of Other Temporary Investments (Applies to AEP)\nOther Temporary Investments include marketable securities that management intends to hold for less than one year and investments by AEP\u2019s protected cell of EIS. See \u201cOther Temporary Investments\u201d section of Note 1 for additional information.\nThe following is a summary of Other Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash:\n(a)Primarily represents amounts held for the repayment of debt.\n(b)Primarily short and intermediate maturities which may be sold and do not contain maturity dates.\nThe following table provides the activity for fixed income and equity securities within Other Temporary Investments:\nFair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nSecurities held in trust funds for decommissioning nuclear facilities and for the disposal of SNF are recorded at fair value. See \u201cNuclear Trust Funds\u201d section of Note 1 for additional information.\nThe following is a summary of nuclear trust fund investments:\nThe following table provides the securities activity within the decommissioning and SNF trusts:\nThe base cost of fixed income securities was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The base cost of equity securities was $568 million and $654 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe fair value of fixed income securities held in the nuclear trust funds, summarized by contractual maturities, as of December 31, 2023 was as follows:\nFair Value Measurements of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFor a discussion of fair value accounting and the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy, see the \u201cFair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities\u201d section of Note 1.\nThe following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Registrants\u2019 financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. As required by the accounting guidance for \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\u201d financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Management\u2019s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. There have not been any significant changes in management\u2019s valuation techniques.\nAEP\nAEP\nAEP Texas\nAPCo\nI&M\nOPCo\nPSO\nSWEPCo\n(a)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent cash deposits in bank accounts with financial institutions or third-parties. Level 1 and Level 2 amounts primarily represent investments in money market funds.\n(b)Amounts represent publicly-traded equity securities and equity-based mutual funds.\n(c)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent counterparty netting of risk management and hedging contracts and associated cash collateral under the accounting guidance for \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d\n(d)The December 31, 2023 maturities of the net fair value of risk management contracts prior to cash collateral, assets/(liabilities), were as follows: Level 1 matures $(11) million in 2024 and $(4) million in 2025-2027; Level 2 matures $(99) million in 2024, $(44) million in periods 2025-2027, $7 million in periods 2028-2029 and $2 million in periods 2030-2033; Level 3 matures $74 million in 2024, $43 million in periods 2025-2027, $18 million in periods 2028-2029 and $(16) million in periods 2030-2033. Risk management commodity contracts are substantially comprised of power contracts.\n(e)Amounts in \u201cOther\u201d column primarily represent accrued interest receivables from financial institutions. Level 1 amounts primarily represent investments in money market funds.\n(f)The December 31, 2022 maturities of the net fair value of risk management contracts prior to cash collateral, assets/(liabilities), were as follows: Level 1 matures $(7) million in 2023; Level 2 matures $182 million in 2023, $134 million in periods 2024-2026; $10 million in periods 2027-2028 and $1 million in periods 2029-2033; Level 3 matures $128 million in 2023, $6 million in periods 2024-2026, $6 million in periods 2027-2028 and $(5) million in periods 2029-2033. Risk management commodity contracts are substantially comprised of power contracts.\nThe following tables set forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of net trading derivatives classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy:\n(a)Included in revenues on the statements of income.\n(b)Represents the change in fair value between the beginning of the reporting period and the settlement of the risk management commodity contract.\n(c)Included in cash flow hedges on the statements of comprehensive income.\n(d)Represents existing assets or liabilities that were previously categorized as Level 2.\n(e)Transfers are recognized based on their value at the beginning of the reporting period that the transfer occurred.\n(f)Relates to the net gains (losses) of those contracts that are not reflected on the statements of income. These changes in fair value are recorded as regulatory liabilities for net gains and as regulatory assets for net losses or accounts payable.\nThe following tables quantify the significant unobservable inputs used in developing the fair value of Level 3 positions:\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(a)Represents market prices in dollars per MWh.\n(b)Represents market prices in dollars per MMBtu.\n(c)The weighted-average is the product of the forward market price of the underlying commodity and volume weighted by term.\nThe following table provides the measurement uncertainty of fair value measurements to increases (decreases) in significant unobservable inputs related to Energy Contracts, Natural Gas Contracts, FTRs and Other Investments for the Registrants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nUncertainty of Fair Value Measurements\n12. INCOME TAXES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe details of the Registrants\u2019 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) as reported are as follows:\nThe following are reconciliations for the Registrants between the federal income taxes computed by multiplying pretax income by the federal statutory tax rate and the income taxes reported:\n(a)2021 amount represents an out of period adjustment related to Deferred Income Taxes and Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Management concluded the misstatement and subsequent correction was not material to the 2021 or prior period financial statements.\nNet Deferred Tax Liability\nThe following tables show elements of the net deferred tax liability and significant temporary differences for each Registrant:\nFederal and State Income Tax Audit Status\nThe statute of limitations for the IRS to examine AEP and subsidiaries originally filed federal return has expired for tax years 2016 and earlier. AEP has agreed to extend the statute of limitations on the 2017-2019 tax returns to October 31, 2024, to allow time for our refund claim to be approved by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The statute of limitations for the 2020 return is set to naturally expire in October 2024 as well.\nThe current IRS audit and associated refund claim evolved from a net operating loss carryback to 2015 that originated in the 2017 return. AEP has received and agreed to immaterial IRS proposed adjustments on the 2017 tax return. The IRS exam is complete, and AEP is currently waiting on the IRS to submit the refund claim to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for resolution and final approval.\nAEP and subsidiaries file income tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions. These taxing authorities routinely examine the tax returns, and AEP and subsidiaries are currently under examination in several state and local jurisdictions. Generally, the statutes of limitations have expired for tax years prior to 2017. In addition, management is monitoring and continues to evaluate the potential impact of federal legislation and corresponding state conformity.\nNet Income Tax Operating Loss Carryforward\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo have state net income tax operating loss carryforwards as indicated in the table below:\nNA Not applicable.\nTax Credit Carryforward\nFederal and state net income tax operating losses sustained in 2017, 2019 and 2021 resulted in unused federal and state income tax credits. As of December 31, 2023, the Registrants have federal tax credit carryforwards and AEP and PSO have state tax credit carryforwards as indicated in the table below. If these credits are not utilized, federal general business tax credits will expire in the years 2036 through 2041 and state tax credits will remain available indefinitely.\nThe Registrants anticipate future federal taxable income will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of the federal tax credits before they expire unused.\nValuation Allowance\nAEP assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate tax character will be generated to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets. When the evaluation of the evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that AEP will not be able to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce existing deferred tax assets to the net realizable amount. Objective evidence evaluated includes whether AEP has a history of recognizing income, future reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.\nValuation allowance activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe amount and activity of unrecognized tax benefits was not material for the Registrants for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Management believes that there will be no significant net increase or decrease in unrecognized benefits within 12 months of the reporting date. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate for AEP as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $13 million, $23 million, and $14 million, respectively.\nFederal Tax Legislation\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed H.R. 5376 into law, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA. Most notably this budget reconciliation legislation creates a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income (Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax or CAMT), extends and increases the value of PTCs and ITCs, adds a nuclear and clean hydrogen PTC, an energy storage ITC and allows the sale or transfer of tax credits to third parties for cash. As further significant guidance from Treasury and the IRS is expected on the tax provisions in the IRA, AEP will continue to monitor any issued guidance and evaluate the impact on future net income, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn December 2022, the IRS released Notice 2023-7, which provided initial CAMT guidance that AEP can begin to rely on in 2023. Notably, the interim guidance in Notice 2023-7 confirmed the CAMT depreciation adjustment includes tax depreciation that is capitalized to inventory under \u00a7263A and recovered as part of cost of goods sold, providing significant relief to AEP\u2019s potential CAMT exposure. In September 2023, the IRS released Notice 2023-64, which clarifies and supplements items in Notice 2023-7 and stated that additional guidance in the form of proposed regulations is expected. AEP will continue to monitor and assess any additional guidance.\nAEP and subsidiaries expect to be applicable corporations for purposes of the CAMT beginning in 2023. CAMT cash taxes are expected to be partially offset by regulatory recovery, the utilization of tax credits and additionally the cash inflow generated by the sale of tax credits. The sale of tax credits are presented in the operating section of the statements of cash flows consistent with the presentation of cash taxes paid. AEP presents the loss on sale of tax credits through income tax expense.\nIn June 2023, the IRS issued temporary regulations related to the transfer of tax credits. In the third and fourth quarter of 2023, AEP, on behalf of PSO, SWEPCo and AEP Energy Supply, LLC, entered into transferability agreements with nonaffiliated parties to sell 2023 generated PTCs resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $102 million received in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an additional $76 million expected in early 2024. AEP expects to continue to explore the ability to efficiently monetize its tax credits through third party transferability agreements.\n13. LEASES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe Registrants lease property, plant and equipment including, but not limited to, fleet, information technology and real estate leases. These leases require payments of non-lease components, including related property taxes, operating and maintenance costs. AEP does not separate non-lease components from associated lease components. Many of these leases have purchase or renewal options. Leases not renewed are often replaced by other leases. Options to renew or purchase a lease are included in the measurement of lease assets and liabilities if it is reasonably certain the Registrant will exercise the option.\nLease obligations are measured using the discount rate implicit in the lease when that rate is readily determinable. AEP has visibility into the rate implicit in the lease when assets are leased from selected financial institutions under master leasing agreements. When the implicit rate is not readily determinable, the Registrants measure their lease obligation using their estimated secured incremental borrowing rate. Incremental borrowing rates are comprised of an underlying risk-free rate and a secured credit spread relative to the lessee on a matched maturity basis.\nOperating lease rentals and finance lease amortization costs are generally charged to Other Operation and Maintenance expense in accordance with rate-making treatment for regulated operations. The amortization costs related to the Rockport finance lease were charged to Depreciation and Amortization. Interest on finance lease liabilities is generally charged to Interest Expense. Lease costs associated with capital projects are included in Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets. For regulated operations with finance leases, a finance lease asset and offsetting liability are recorded at the present value of the remaining lease payments for each reporting period. Finance leases for nonregulated property are accounted for as if the assets were owned and financed. The components of rental costs were as follows:\n(a)Excludes variable and short-term lease costs, which were immaterial.\nSupplemental information related to leases are shown in the tables below:\nThe following tables show property, plant and equipment under finance leases and noncurrent assets under operating leases and related obligations recorded on the balance sheets. Unless shown as a separate line on the balance sheets due to materiality, net operating lease assets are included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets, current finance lease obligations are included in Other Current Liabilities and long-term finance lease obligations are included in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets. Lease obligations are not recognized on the balance sheets for lease agreements with a lease term of less than twelve months.\nFuture minimum lease payments consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023:\nMaster Lease Agreements (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants lease certain equipment under master lease agreements. Under the lease agreements, the lessor is guaranteed a residual value up to a stated percentage of the equipment cost at the end of the lease term. If the actual fair value of the leased equipment is below the guaranteed residual value at the end of the lease term, the Registrants are committed to pay the difference between the actual fair value and the residual value guarantee. Historically, at the end of the lease term the fair value has been in excess of the amount guaranteed. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum potential loss by the Registrants for these lease agreements assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the lease term was as follows:\nLessor Activity\nThe Registrants\u2019 lessor activity was immaterial as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n14. FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants, unless indicated otherwise.\nCommon Stock (Applies to AEP)\nThe following table is a reconciliation of common stock share activity:\n(a)Reissued Treasury Stock used to fulfill share commitments related to AEP\u2019s Equity Units. See \u201cEquity Units\u201d section below for additional information.\nATM Program\nIn 2023, AEP filed a prospectus supplement and executed an Equity Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which AEP may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1.7 billion of its common stock through an ATM offering program, including an equity forward sales component. The compensation paid to the selling agents by AEP may be up to 2% of the gross offering proceeds of the shares. There were no issuances under the ATM program for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLong-term Debt\nThe following table details long-term debt outstanding:\n(a)For certain series of Pollution Control Bonds, interest rates are subject to periodic adjustment. Certain series may be purchased on demand at periodic interest adjustment dates. Letters of credit from banks and insurance policies support certain series. Consequently, these bonds have been classified for maturity purposes as Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets.\n(b)Certain Pollution Control Bonds are subject to redemption earlier than the maturity date.\n(c)Notes payable represent outstanding promissory notes issued under term loan agreements and credit agreements with a number of banks and other financial institutions. At expiration, all notes then issued and outstanding are due and payable. Interest rates are both fixed and variable. Variable rates generally relate to specified short-term interest rates.\n(d)Dates represent the scheduled final payment dates for the securitization bonds. The legal maturity date is one to two years later. These bonds have been classified for maturity and repayment purposes based on the scheduled final payment date.\n(e)Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligation consists of a liability along with accrued interest for disposal of SNF. See \u201cSpent Nuclear Fuel Disposal\u201d section of Note 6 for additional information.\n(f)See \u201cEquity Units\u201d section below for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2023, outstanding long-term debt was payable as follows:\nLong-term Debt Subsequent Events\nIn January and February 2024, I&M retired $8 million and $8 million, respectively, of Notes Payable related to DCC Fuel.\nIn January and February 2024, Transource Energy issued $16 million and $2 million, respectively, of variable rate Other Long-term Debt due in 2025.\nIn February 2024, AEP Texas retired $12 million of Securitization Bonds.\nIn February 2024, APCo retired $13 million of Securitization Bonds.\nEquity Units (Applies to AEP)\n2020 Equity Units\nIn August 2020, AEP issued 17 million Equity Units initially in the form of corporate units, at a stated amount of $50 per unit, for a total stated amount of $850 million. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $833 million. The proceeds were used to support AEP\u2019s overall capital expenditure plans.\nEach corporate unit represents a 1/20 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of AEP\u2019s 1.30% Junior Subordinated Notes due in 2025 and a forward equity purchase contract which settled after three years in August 2023. In June 2023, AEP successfully remarketed the Junior Subordinated Notes on behalf of holders of the corporate units. AEP did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing which were used to purchase a portfolio of treasury securities that matured on August 14, 2023. On August 15, 2023, the proceeds from the treasury portfolio were used to settle the forward equity purchase contract with AEP. The interest rate on the Junior Subordinated Notes was reset to 5.699% with the maturity remaining in 2025. In August 2023, AEP issued 10,048,668 shares of AEP common stock and received proceeds totaling $850 million under the settlement of the forward equity purchase contract. AEP common stock held in treasury was used to settle the forward equity purchase contract. The proceeds were used to pay down debt balances and support AEP\u2019s overall capital expenditure plans.\nDebt Covenants (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)\nCovenants in AEPTCo\u2019s note purchase agreements and indenture limit the amount of contractually-defined priority debt (which includes a further sub-limit of $50 million of secured debt) to 10% of consolidated tangible net assets. AEPTCo\u2019s contractually-defined priority debt was 1.3% of consolidated tangible net assets as of December 31, 2023. The method for calculating the consolidated tangible net assets is contractually-defined in the note purchase agreement.\nDividend Restrictions\nUtility Subsidiaries\u2019 Restrictions\nParent depends on its utility subsidiaries to pay dividends to shareholders. AEP utility subsidiaries pay dividends to Parent provided funds are legally available. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends.\nAll of the dividends declared by AEP\u2019s utility subsidiaries that provide transmission or local distribution services are subject to a Federal Power Act requirement that prohibits the payment of dividends out of capital accounts in certain circumstances; payment of dividends is generally allowed out of retained earnings. The Federal Power Act also creates a reserve on earnings attributable to hydroelectric generation plants. Because of their ownership of such plants, this reserve applies to APCo and I&M.\nCertain AEP subsidiaries have credit agreements that contain covenants that limit their debt to capitalization ratio to 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in the credit agreements.\nThe most restrictive dividend limitation for certain AEP subsidiaries is through the Federal Power Act restriction, while for other AEP subsidiaries the most restrictive dividend limitation is through the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum amount of restricted net assets of AEP\u2019s subsidiaries that may not be distributed to the Parent in the form of a loan, advance or dividend was $16.6 billion.\nThe Federal Power Act restriction limits the ability of the AEP subsidiaries owning hydroelectric generation to pay dividends out of retained earnings. Additionally, the credit agreement covenant restrictions can limit the ability of the AEP subsidiaries to pay dividends out of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of any such restrictions were as follows:\nAEP AEP Texas AEPTCo APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\nRestricted Retained Earnings\n$ 3,003.4 (a) $ 737.1 $ - $ 721.5 $ 702.6 $ - $ 1.3 $ 337.3\n(a) Includes the restrictions of consolidated and non-consolidated subsidiaries.\nParent Restrictions (Applies to AEP)\nThe holders of AEP\u2019s common stock are entitled to receive the dividends declared by the Board of Directors provided funds are legally available for such dividends. Parent\u2019s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries.\nPursuant to the leverage restrictions in credit agreements, AEP must maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in the credit agreements. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had $7.6 billion of available retained earnings to pay dividends to common shareholders. AEP paid $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion of dividends to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLines of Credit and Short-term Debt (Applies to AEP)\nAEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries. The program funds a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP\u2019s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries; and the short-term debt requirements of subsidiaries that are not participating in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons, as direct borrowers. As of December 31, 2023, AEP had $5 billion in revolving credit facilities to support its commercial paper program. Securitized Debt for Receivables, for the year ended 2023, had a weighted-average interest rate of 5.33% and a maximum amount outstanding of $900 million. The commercial paper program, for the year ended 2023, had a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38% and a maximum amount outstanding of $3.2 billion. AEP\u2019s outstanding short-term debt was as follows:\n(a) Weighted-average rate as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(b) Amount of securitized debt for receivables as accounted for under the \u201cTransfers and Servicing\u201d accounting guidance.\nCorporate Borrowing Program (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries)\nAEP subsidiaries use a corporate borrowing program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of AEP\u2019s subsidiaries. The corporate borrowing program includes a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP\u2019s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries; and direct borrowing from AEP. The AEP Utility Money Pool operates in accordance with the terms and conditions of its agreement filed with the FERC. The amounts of outstanding loans to (borrowings from) the Utility Money Pool as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in Advances to Affiliates and Advances from Affiliates, respectively, on the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets. The Utility Money Pool participants\u2019 money pool activity and corresponding authorized borrowing limits are described in the following tables:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023:\nYear Ended December 31, 2022:\n(a) Amount represents the combined authorized short-term borrowing limit the State Transcos have from FERC or state regulatory commissions.\nThe activity in the above tables does not include short-term lending activity of certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries. AEP Texas\u2019 wholly-owned subsidiary, AEP Texas North Generation Company, LLC and SWEPCo\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Mutual Energy SWEPCo, LLC participate in the Nonutility Money Pool. The amounts of outstanding loans to the Nonutility Money Pool as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in Advances to Affiliates on each subsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets. The Nonutility Money Pool participants\u2019 money pool activity is described in the following tables:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023:\nMaximum Loans Average Loans Loans to the Nonutility\nto the Nonutility to the Nonutility Money Pool as of\nCompany Money Pool Money Pool December 31, 2023\n(in millions)\nAEP Texas $ 7.1 $ 6.9 $ 7.1\nSWEPCo 2.8 2.4 2.2\nYear Ended December 31, 2022:\nMaximum Loans Average Loans Loans to the Nonutility\nto the Nonutility to the Nonutility Money Pool as of\nCompany Money Pool Money Pool December 31, 2022\n(in millions)\nAEP Texas $ 7.0 $ 6.8 $ 6.9\nSWEPCo 2.1 2.1 2.1\nAEP has a direct financing relationship with AEPTCo to meet its short-term borrowing needs. The amounts of outstanding loans to and borrowings from AEP as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in Advances to Affiliates and Advances from Affiliates, respectively, on AEPTCo\u2019s balance sheets. AEPTCo\u2019s direct financing activities with AEP and corresponding authorized borrowing limits are described in the following tables:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023:\nMaximum Maximum Average Average Borrowings from Loans to Authorized\nBorrowings Loans Borrowings Loans AEP as of AEP as of Short-term\nfrom AEP to AEP from AEP to AEP December 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 Borrowing Limit\n(in millions)\n$ 44.4 $ 158.1 $ 3.9 $ 64.2 $ 44.4 $ - $ 50.0 (a)\nYear Ended December 31, 2022:\nMaximum Maximum Average Average Borrowings from Loans to Authorized\nBorrowings Loans Borrowings Loans AEP as of AEP as of Short-term\nfrom AEP to AEP from AEP to AEP December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 Borrowing Limit\n(in millions)\n$ 52.4 $ 141.8 $ 6.7 $ 57.5 $ 29.4 $ - $ 50.0 (a)\n(a) Amount represents the authorized short-term borrowing limit from FERC or state regulatory agencies not otherwise included in the utility money pool above.\nThe maximum and minimum interest rates for funds either borrowed from or loaned to the Utility Money Pool are summarized in the following table:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nMaximum Interest Rate 5.81 % 5.28 % 0.48 %\nMinimum Interest Rate 4.66 % 0.10 % 0.02 %\nThe average interest rates for funds borrowed from and loaned to the Utility Money Pool are summarized in the following table:\nMaximum, minimum and average interest rates for funds loaned to the Nonutility Money Pool are summarized in the following table:\nAEPTCo\u2019s maximum, minimum and average interest rates for funds either borrowed from or loaned to AEP are summarized in the following table:\nInterest expense related to short-term borrowing activities with the Utility Money Pool, Nonutility Money Pool and direct borrowing financing relationship are included in Interest Expense on each of the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 statements of income. The Registrant Subsidiaries incurred interest expense for all short-term borrowing activities as follows:\nInterest income related to short-term lending activities with the Utility Money Pool, Nonutility Money Pool and direct borrowing financing relationship are included in Interest Income, unless shown as Other Income due to materiality, on each of the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 statements of income. The Registrant Subsidiaries earned interest income for all short-term lending activities as follows:\nCredit Facilities\nSee \u201cLetters of Credit\u201d section of Note 6 for additional information.\nSecuritized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit (Applies to AEP)\nAEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits. Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from the bank conduits for the interest in the receivables AEP Credit acquires from affiliated utility subsidiaries. These securitized transactions allow AEP Credit to repay its outstanding debt obligations, continue to purchase the operating companies\u2019 receivables and accelerate AEP Credit\u2019s cash collections.\nAEP Credit\u2019s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of $900 million from bank conduits to purchase receivables. The agreement was amended in August 2023 to increase the commitment from $750 million and expires in September 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the affiliated utility subsidiaries were in compliance with all requirements under the agreement.\nAccounts receivable information for AEP Credit was as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(dollars in millions)\nEffective Interest Rates on Securitization of Accounts Receivable 5.33 % 1.84 % 0.19 %\nNet Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Written Off $ 30.7 $ 29.5 $ 26.5\nAEP Credit\u2019s delinquent customer accounts receivable represent accounts greater than 30 days past due.\nSecuritized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries, except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nUnder this sale of receivables arrangement, the Registrant Subsidiaries sell, without recourse, certain of their customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenue balances to AEP Credit and are charged a fee based on AEP Credit\u2019s financing costs, administrative costs and uncollectible accounts experience for each Registrant Subsidiary\u2019s receivables. APCo does not have regulatory authority to sell its West Virginia accounts receivable. KPCo ceased selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit in the first quarter of 2022, based on the expected sale to Liberty. As a result, in the first quarter of 2022, KPCo recorded an allowance for uncollectible accounts on its balance sheet for those receivables no longer sold to AEP Credit. In the third quarter of 2023, KPCo resumed selling accounts receivable to AEP Credit, due to the termination of the sale to Liberty, and the balance in KPCo\u2019s allowance for uncollectible accounts was reversed. The costs of customer accounts receivable sold are reported in Other Operation expense on the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 statements of income. The Registrant Subsidiaries manage and service their customer accounts receivable, which are sold to AEP Credit. AEP Credit securitizes the eligible receivables for the operating companies and retains the remainder.\nThe amount of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues under the sale of receivables agreement were:\nThe fees paid to AEP Credit for customer accounts receivable sold were:\n(a)In 2021, due to the successful collection of accounts receivable balances during the COVID-19 pandemic, the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced, resulting in the issuance of credits to offset the higher fees previously paid and to lower subsequent fees paid.\nThe proceeds on the sale of receivables to AEP Credit were:\n15. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe disclosures in this note apply to AEP only. The impact of AEP\u2019s share-based compensation plans is insignificant to the financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries.\nAwards under the American Electric Power System 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2015 LTIP), which replaced prior long-term incentive plans effective April 2015, may be granted to employees and directors. The 2015 LTIP was subsequently amended in September 2016. The 2015 LTIP provides for a maximum of 10 million AEP common shares to be available for grant to eligible employees and directors. As of December 31, 2023, 3,698,144 shares remained available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP. No new awards may be granted under the Prior Plan. Awards granted under the 2015 LTIP awards may be made in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. Shares issued pursuant to a stock option or a stock appreciation right reduce the shares remaining available for grants under the 2015 LTIP by 0.286 of a share. Each share issued for any other award that settles in AEP stock reduces the shares remaining available for grants under the 2015 LTIP by one share. Cash settled awards do not reduce the number of shares remaining available under the 2015 LTIP. The following sections provide further information regarding each type of stock-based compensation award granted under these plans.\nPerformance Shares\nPerformance units granted prior to 2017 were settled in cash rather than AEP common stock and did not reduce the number of shares remaining available under the 2015 LTIP. Those performance units had a fair value upon vesting equal to the average closing market price of AEP common stock for the last 20 trading days of the performance period. Performance shares granted in and after 2017 are settled in AEP common stock and reduce the aggregate share authorization. In all cases the number of performance shares held at the end of the three-year performance period is multiplied by the performance score for such period to determine the actual number of performance shares that participants realize. The performance score can range from 0% to 200% and is determined at the end of the performance period based on performance measures, which include both performance and market conditions, established for each grant at the beginning of the performance period by the Human Resources Committee of AEP\u2019s Board of Directors (HR Committee).\nCertain employees must satisfy a minimum stock ownership requirement. If those employees have not met their stock ownership requirement, a portion or all of their performance shares are mandatorily deferred upon vesting into AEP career shares to the extent needed to meet their stock ownership requirement. AEP career shares are a form of non-qualified deferred compensation that has a value equivalent to a share of AEP common stock. AEP career shares are settled in AEP common stock after the participant\u2019s termination of employment.\nAEP career shares are recorded in Paid-in Capital on the balance sheets. Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on both performance shares and AEP career shares accrue as additional shares. Management records compensation cost for performance shares over an approximately three-year vesting period. Performance shares are recorded as mezzanine equity on the balance sheets until the vesting date and compensation cost is calculated at fair value based on the performance metrics for each grant. Performance shares granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 have three performance metrics: (a) three-year cumulative operating earnings per-share with a 50% weight, (b) relative total shareholder return with a 40% weight and (c) renewable generation additions (2023 grants) or non-emitting generation capacity as a percentage of total owned and purchased capacity (2022 and 2021 grants) with a 10% weight. The three-year cumulative operating earnings per-share and renewable generation additions or non-emitting generating capacity metrics are adjusted quarterly for changes in performance relative to the metric approved by the HR Committee. The total shareholder return metric is measured relative to a peer group of similar companies and is based on a third-party Monte Carlo valuation. The value related to this metric does not change over the three-year vesting period.\nThe HR Committee awarded performance shares and reinvested dividends on outstanding performance shares and AEP career shares as follows:\n(a)The vesting period for the reinvested dividends on performance shares is equal to the remaining life of the related performance shares. Dividends on AEP career shares vest immediately when the dividend is awarded but are not settled in AEP common stock until after the participant\u2019s AEP employment ends.\nPerformance scores and final awards are determined and approved by the HR Committee in accordance with the pre-established performance measures within approximately two months after the end of the performance period.\nThe certified performance scores and shares earned for the three-year periods were as follows:\n(a)Performance shares settled in AEP common stock in the quarter following the end of the year shown.\nThe settlements were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nPerformance Shares and AEP Career Shares 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nAEP Common Stock Settlements for Performance Shares $ 41.8 $ 43.2 $ 54.7\nAEP Common Stock Settlements for Career Share Distributions 8.3 5.1 4.0\nA summary of the status of AEP\u2019s nonvested Performance Shares as of December 31, 2023 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n(a)The vested Performance Shares will be converted to 448 thousand shares based on the closing share price on the day before settlement.\nMonte Carlo Valuation\nAEP engages a third-party for a Monte Carlo valuation to calculate the fair value of the total shareholder return metric for the performance shares awarded during and after 2017. The valuations use a lattice model and the expected volatility assumptions used were the historical volatilities for AEP and the members of their peer group. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo valuations were as follows:\n(a)Period from award date to vesting date.\n(b)Equivalent to reinvesting dividends.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe HR Committee grants restricted stock units (RSUs), which generally vest, subject to the participant\u2019s continued AEP employment, over at least three years in approximately equal annual increments. The RSUs accrue dividends as additional RSUs. The additional RSUs granted as dividends vest on the same date, subject to the participant\u2019s continued AEP employment, as the underlying RSUs. RSUs are converted into shares of AEP common stock upon vesting. Executive officers are those officers who are subject to the disclosure requirements set forth in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The RSU compensation cost is measured at fair value on the grant date and recorded over the vesting period. Fair value is determined by multiplying the number of RSUs granted by the grant date market closing price. The maximum contractual term of outstanding RSUs is approximately 40 months from the grant date.\nThe HR Committee awarded RSUs, including additional units awarded as dividends, as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nRestricted Stock Units 2023 2022 2021\nAwarded Units (in thousands) 268.4 290.4 280.0\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value $ 88.52 $ 90.48 $ 80.39\nThe total fair value and total intrinsic value of restricted stock units vested were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nRestricted Stock Units 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nFair Value of Restricted Stock Units Vested $ 18.8 $ 17.8 $ 20.5\nIntrinsic Value of Restricted Stock Units Vested (a) 19.0 20.3 22.0\n(a)Intrinsic value is calculated as market price at the vesting date.\nA summary of the status of AEP\u2019s nonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2023 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nThe total aggregate intrinsic value of nonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2023 was $33 million and the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 1.5 years.\nOther Stock-Based Plans\nAEP also has a Stock Unit Accumulation Plan (SUAP) for Non-Employee Directors providing each non-employee director with AEP stock units as a substantial portion of the compensation for their services as a director. The number of stock units provided is based on the closing price of AEP common stock on the last trading day of the quarter for which the stock units were earned. Amounts equivalent to cash dividends on the stock units accrue as additional AEP stock units. The stock units granted to non-employee directors are fully vested on their grant date. Stock units are paid to directors upon termination of their board service or up to 10 years later if the participant so elects. Cash settlements for stock units were calculated based on the average closing price of AEP common stock for the last 20 trading days prior to the distribution date. Effective June 30, 2022, the SUAP was amended to pay stock units in AEP common stock rather than cash.\nManagement records compensation costs for stock units when the units are awarded and prior to June 2022 adjusted the liability for changes in value based on the current 20-day average closing price of AEP common stock on the valuation date.\nAfter five years of service on the Board of Directors, non-employee directors receive subsequent AEP stock units as contributions to an AEP stock fund under the Stock Unit Accumulation Plan. Such amounts may be exchanged into other market-based investment options available to employees that participate in AEP\u2019s Incentive Compensation Deferral Plan. These balances are paid in cash upon termination of board service or up to 10 years later if the participant so elects.\nAEP common stock and cash settlements for stock unit distributions were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Board of Directors awarded stock units, including units awarded for dividends, as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\nStock Unit Accumulation Plan for Non-Employee Directors 2023 2022 2021\nAwarded Units (in thousands) 19.8 14.5 12.6\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value $ 82.14 $ 95.16 $ 84.54\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nFor share-based payment arrangements the compensation cost, the actual tax benefit from the tax deductions for compensation cost recognized in income and the total compensation cost capitalized were as follows:\n(a)Compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements is included in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses on the statements of income.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $66 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2015 LTIP. Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based arrangements will change as the fair value of performance shares is adjusted each period and as forfeitures for all award types are realized. AEP\u2019s unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.\nUnder the 2015 LTIP, AEP is permitted to use authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, shares acquired in the open market specifically for distribution under these plans, or any combination thereof to fulfill share commitments. AEP\u2019s current practice is to use authorized but unissued shares to fulfill share commitments. The number of shares used to fulfill share commitments is generally reduced to offset tax withholding obligations.\n16. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrant Subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise.\nFor other related party transactions, also see \u201cIncome Taxes and Investment and Production Tax Credits\u201d section of Note 1 in addition to \u201cCorporate Borrowing Program\u201d and \u201cSecuritized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit\u201d sections of Note 14.\nIntercompany Billings\nThe Registrant Subsidiaries and other AEP subsidiaries perform certain utility services for each other when necessary or practical. The costs of these services are billed on a direct-charge basis, whenever possible, or on reasonable basis of proration for services that benefit multiple companies. The billings for services are made at cost and include no compensation for the use of equity capital.\nPower Coordination Agreement (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)\nEffective January 1, 2014, the FERC approved the PCA. Under the PCA, APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo are individually responsible for planning their respective capacity obligations. The PCA allows, but does not obligate, APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo to participate collectively under a common fixed resource requirement capacity plan in PJM and to participate in specified collective Off-system Sales and purchase activities.\nAEPSC conducts power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other risk management activities on behalf of APCo, I&M, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. Certain power and natural gas risk management activities for APCo, I&M, KPCo and WPCo are allocated based on the four member companies\u2019 respective equity positions, while power and natural gas risk management activities for PSO and SWEPCo are allocated based on the Operating Agreement. AEPSC conducts only gasoline, diesel fuel, energy procurement and risk management activities on OPCo\u2019s behalf.\nJoint License Agreement (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries except AEP Texas and SWEPCo)\nAEPTCo entered into a 50-year joint license agreement with APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo and PSO, respectively, allowing either party to occupy the granting party\u2019s facilities or real property. In addition, AEPTCo entered into a 5-year joint license agreement with APCo and WPCo. After the expiration of these agreements, the term shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides notice. The joint license billing provides compensation to the granting party for the cost of carrying assets, including depreciation expense, property taxes, interest expense, return on equity and income taxes. AEPTCo recorded the costs related to these agreements in Other Operation expense on the statements of income. APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO and WPCo recorded income related to these agreements in Sales to AEP Affiliates on the statements of income. The impact of the joint license agreement for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was not material.\nUnit Power Agreements (Applies to I&M)\nA UPA between AEGCo and I&M (the I&M Power Agreement) provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the power (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant unless it is sold to another utility. I&M is obligated, whether or not power is available from AEGCo, to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and as an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M) net of amounts received by AEGCo from any other sources, sufficient to enable AEGCo to pay all of its operating and other expenses, including a rate of return on the common equity of AEGCo as approved by the FERC. The UPA will continue in effect until the debt obligations of AEGCo secured by the Rockport Plant have been satisfied and discharged (currently expected to be December 2028). I&M\u2019s direct purchases from AEGCo were $181 million, $242 million and $218 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

AEP Energy and AEPEP participate in the auction process and have been awarded tranches of OPCo\u2019s SSO load. OPCo\u2019s auction purchases were $87 million, $10 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These direct purchases are presented as Purchased Electricity from AEP Affiliates on OPCo\u2019s statements of income.\nSales and Purchases of Property\nCertain AEP subsidiaries had affiliated sales and purchases of electric property individually amounting to $100 thousand or more, sales and purchases of meters and transformers, and sales and purchases of transmission property. There were no gains or losses recorded on the transactions and the net book value of all sales and purchases for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material. These sales and purchases are recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment on the balance sheets.\nCharitable Contributions to AEP Foundation\nThe American Electric Power Foundation is funded by American Electric Power and its utility operating units. The Foundation provides a permanent, ongoing resource for charitable initiatives and multi-year commitments in the communities served by AEP and initiatives outside of AEP\u2019s 11-state service area. Charitable contributions to the AEP Foundation were not made in 2023 or 2021.

Additional costs for transmission services provided by AEPTCo and other transmission affiliates are billed to AEP East Companies through the PJM OATT. PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA in connection with the operation of the transmission assets of PSO and\nSWEPCo. Under the TCA, AEPSC is responsible for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT. Additional costs for transmission services provided by AEPTCo and other transmission affiliates are billed to PSO and SWEPCo through the SPP OATT. Pursuant to an order from the PUCT, ETT bills AEP Texas for its ERCOT wholesale transmission services.\nThe charges discussed above are recorded in Other Operation expenses on the statements of income. AEPTCo recorded affiliated transmission revenues in Sales to AEP Affiliates on the statements of income. Refer to the Affiliated Revenues section below for amounts related to these transactions.\nThe following table shows the net transmission service charges recorded by the Registrant Subsidiaries:\nAffiliated Revenues\nThe tables below represent revenues from affiliates, net of respective provisions for refund, by type of revenue for the Registrant Subsidiaries. Related party revenues are shown in Sales to AEP Affiliates, Provision for Refund - Affiliated and Other Revenues - Affiliated, respectively, on the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 statements of income.\n17. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nThe accounting guidance for \u201cVariable Interest Entities\u201d is a consolidation model that considers if a company has a variable interest in a VIE. A VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following conditions: the entity\u2019s equity at risk is not sufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, equity owners are unable to direct the activities that most significantly impact the legal entity\u2019s economic performance (or they possess disproportionate voting rights in relation to the economic interest in the legal entity), or the equity owners lack the obligation to absorb the legal entity\u2019s expected losses or the right to receive the legal entity\u2019s expected residual returns. Entities are required to consolidate a VIE when it is determined that they have a controlling financial interest in a VIE and therefore, are the primary beneficiary of that VIE, as defined by the accounting guidance for \u201cVariable Interest Entities.\u201d In determining whether AEP is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management considers whether AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and is obligated to absorb losses or receive the expected residual returns that are significant to the VIE. Management believes that significant assumptions and judgments were applied consistently.\nAEP holds ownership interests in businesses with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE, and if so, whether or not the VIE should be consolidated into AEP\u2019s financial statements. AEP has not provided material financial or other support that was not previously contractually required to any of its consolidated VIEs. If an entity is determined not to be a VIE, or if the entity is determined to be a VIE and AEP is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the entity is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nConsolidated Variable Interests Entities\nSabine (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nSabine is a mining operator providing mining services to SWEPCo. SWEPCo has no equity investment in Sabine but is Sabine\u2019s only customer. SWEPCo guarantees the debt obligations and lease obligations of Sabine. Under the terms of the note agreements, substantially all assets are pledged and all rights under the lignite mining agreement are assigned to SWEPCo. The creditors of Sabine have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo. Under the provisions of the mining agreement, SWEPCo is required to pay, as a part of the cost of lignite delivered, an amount equal to mining costs plus a management fee. In addition, SWEPCo determines how much coal will be mined each year. Based on these facts, management concluded that SWEPCo is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate Sabine. SWEPCo\u2019s total billings from Sabine for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $101 million, $168 million and $162 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, SWEPCo fuel deliveries, including billings of all fixed costs, from Sabine ceased, which resulted in a decrease in billings in 2023 as compared to 2022. See \"Pirkey Plant and Related Fuel Operations\" section of Note 5 for additional information. See the tables below for the classification of Sabine\u2019s assets and liabilities on SWEPCo\u2019s balance sheets.\nAs part of the process to receive a renewal of a Texas Railroad Commission permit for lignite mining, SWEPCo provides guarantees of mine reclamation of $155 million. Since SWEPCo uses self-bonding, the guarantee commits SWEPCo to complete the reclamation, in the event, Sabine does not complete the work. This guarantee ends upon completion of reclamation. Pirkey Plant was retired in March 2023 and the mine end-of-life has been adjusted accordingly. Reclamation is expected to be complete by 2037 at an estimated cost of $144 million. Actual reclamation costs could vary due to inflation and scope changes to the mine reclamation. SWEPCo recovers these costs through its fuel clauses. As of December 31, 2023, SWEPCo has recorded $134 million of mine reclamation costs in ARO and $34 million in Accounts Payable - Affiliated Companies for collected reclamation costs that have been billed to SWEPCo. SWEPCo has collected $92 million through a rider for reclamation costs. The remaining ARO of $76 million is recorded in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on SWEPCo\u2019s balance sheets.\nDCC Fuel (Applies to AEP and I&M)\nI&M has nuclear fuel lease agreements with DCC Fuel, which was formed for the purpose of acquiring, owning and leasing nuclear fuel to I&M. DCC Fuel purchased the nuclear fuel from I&M with funds received from the issuance of notes to financial institutions. Each DCC Fuel entity is a single-lessee leasing arrangement with only one asset and is capitalized with all debt. Each is a separate legal entity from I&M, the assets of which are not available to satisfy the debts of I&M. Payments on the leases for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $97 million, $84 million and $91 million, respectively. The leases were recorded as finance leases on I&M\u2019s balance sheets as title to the nuclear fuel transfers to I&M at the end of the respective lease terms, which do not exceed 54 months. Based on I&M\u2019s control of DCC Fuel, management concluded that I&M is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate DCC Fuel. The finance leases are eliminated upon consolidation. See the tables below for the classification of DCC Fuel\u2019s assets and liabilities on I&M\u2019s balance sheets.\nTransition Funding (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nTransition Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to restructuring legislation in Texas. Management has concluded that AEP Texas is the primary beneficiary of Transition Funding because AEP Texas has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and AEP Texas\u2019 equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, AEP Texas is required to consolidate Transition Funding. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $72 million and $70 million of the securitized bonds were included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated, respectively, on the balance sheets. The securitized bonds included in Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated were immaterial and $71 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, on the balance sheets. Transition Funding has securitized transition assets of $64 million and $125 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets. The securitized transition assets represent the right to impose and collect Texas true-up costs from customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from AEP Texas under-recovery mechanisms approved by the PUCT. The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized transition assets. The bondholders have no recourse to AEP Texas or any other AEP entity. AEP Texas acts as the servicer for Transition Funding\u2019s securitized transition assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Transition Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs. See the tables below for the classification of Transition Funding\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nRestoration Funding (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)\nRestoration Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to storm restoration of AEP Texas\u2019 distribution system primarily due to damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. Management has concluded that AEP Texas is the primary beneficiary of Restoration Funding because AEP Texas has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and AEP Texas\u2019 equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, AEP Texas is required to consolidate Restoration Funding. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $24 million and $24 million of the securitized bonds were included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated, respectively, and $126 million and $150 million were included in Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated, respectively, on the balance sheets. Restoration Funding has securitized assets of $139 million and $161 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets. The securitized restoration assets represent the right to impose and collect Texas storm restoration costs from customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from AEP Texas under-recovery mechanisms approved by the PUCT. The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets. The bondholders have no recourse to AEP Texas or any other AEP entity. AEP Texas acts as the servicer for Restoration Funding\u2019s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Restoration Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs. See the tables below for the classification of Restoration Funding\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nAppalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding (Applies to AEP and APCo)\nAppalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to APCo\u2019s under-recovered ENEC deferral balance. Management has concluded that APCo is the primary beneficiary of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding because APCo has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and APCo\u2019s equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, APCo is required to consolidate Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $27 million and $26 million of the securitized bonds were included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated, respectively, and $120 million and $147 million were included in Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated, respectively, on the balance sheets. Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding has securitized assets of $133 million and $160 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets. The phase-in recovery property represents the right to impose and collect West Virginia deferred generation charges from customers receiving electric transmission, distribution and generation service from APCo under a recovery mechanism approved by the WVPSC. In November 2013, securitization bonds were issued. The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets. The bondholders have no recourse to APCo or any other AEP entity. APCo acts as the servicer for Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding\u2019s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs. See the tables below for the classification of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding\u2019s assets and liabilities on APCo\u2019s balance sheets.\nAEP Credit (Applies to AEP)\nAEP Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. AEP Credit purchases, without recourse, accounts receivable from certain utility subsidiaries of AEP to reduce working capital requirements. AEP provides a minimum of 5% equity and up to 35% of AEP Credit\u2019s short-term borrowing needs in excess of third-party financings. Any third-party financing of AEP Credit only has recourse to the receivables securitized for such financing. Based on AEP\u2019s control of AEP Credit, management concluded that\nAEP is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate AEP Credit. See the tables below for the classification of AEP Credit\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets. See \u201cSecuritized Accounts Receivables - AEP Credit\u201d section of Note 14.\nEIS (Applies to AEP)\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries participate in one protected cell of EIS for seven lines of insurance. EIS has multiple protected cells. Neither AEP nor its subsidiaries have an equity investment in EIS. The AEP System is essentially this EIS cell\u2019s only participant, but allows certain third-parties access to this insurance. AEP\u2019s subsidiaries and any allowed third-parties share in the insurance coverage, premiums and risk of loss from claims. Based on AEP\u2019s control and the structure of the protected cell of EIS, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary of the protected cell and is required to consolidate the protected cell of EIS. The insurance premium expense to the protected cell for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $34 million, $31 million and $30 million, respectively. See the tables below for the classification of the protected cell\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets. The amount reported as equity is the protected cell\u2019s policy holders\u2019 surplus.\nTransource Energy (Applies to AEP)\nTransource Energy was formed for the purpose of investing in utilities which develop, acquire, construct, own and operate transmission facilities in accordance with FERC-approved rates. AEP has equity and voting ownership of 86.5% with the other owner having 13.5% interest. Management has concluded that Transource Energy is a VIE and that AEP is the primary beneficiary because AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity and AEP\u2019s equity interest could potentially be significant. Therefore, AEP is required to consolidate Transource Energy. Transource Energy\u2019s activities consist of the development, construction and operation of FERC-regulated transmission assets in Missouri, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Oklahoma. Transource Energy has a credit facility agreement where borrowings are loaned through intercompany lending agreements to its subsidiaries. The creditor to the agreement has no recourse to the general credit of AEP. Transource Energy\u2019s credit facility agreement contains certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%. See the tables below for the classification of Transource Energy\u2019s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.\nCompetitive Contracted Renewables (Applies to AEP)\nAs of December 31, 2023, Apple Blossom, Black Oak, Santa Rita East and Dry Lake are no longer consolidated VIEs due to the sale of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio. See the table below for the classification of assets and liabilities on the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022, nonaffiliated interests in Apple Blossom and Black Oak, Santa Rita East and Dry Lake were $94 million, $58 million and $34 million, respectively, presented in Noncontrolling Interests on the balance sheets. The results of operations for these interests for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material to the AEP statements of income.\nThe balances below represent the assets and liabilities of the VIEs that are consolidated. These balances include intercompany transactions that are eliminated upon consolidation.\n(a)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $8 million.\n(b)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $6 million.\n(c)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $2 million.\n(a)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $16 million.\n(b)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $7 million.\n(c)Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of $2 million.\nNon-Consolidated Significant Variable Interests\nDHLC (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)\nDHLC is a mining operator which previously sold 50% of the lignite produced to SWEPCo and 50% to CLECO. The operations of DHLC are governed by the lignite mining agreement among SWEPCo, CLECO and DHLC. SWEPCo and CLECO share the executive board seats and voting rights equally. In accordance with the lignite mining agreement, each entity is responsible for 50% of DHLC\u2019s obligations, including debt. SWEPCo and CLECO equally approve DHLC\u2019s annual budget. The creditors of DHLC have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo. As SWEPCo is the sole equity owner of DHLC, it receives 100% of the management fee earned by DHLC. In April 2020, SWEPCo and CLECO jointly filed a notification letter to the LPSC providing notice of the cessation of lignite mining. SWEPCo\u2019s total billings from DHLC for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material, and for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $47 million. DHLC paid dividends of $1 million, $25 million, and $0 to SWEPCo for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. SWEPCo does not have the power to control decision making that significantly impacts the economic performance of DHLC because such power is shared with CLECO. As a result, SWEPCo is not required to consolidate DHLC as it is not the primary beneficiary, although it holds a significant variable interest in DHLC. SWEPCo\u2019s equity investment in DHLC is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on SWEPCo\u2019s balance sheets.\nSWEPCo\u2019s investment in DHLC was:\nOVEC (Applies to AEP and OPCo)\nAEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC. As of December 31, 2023, AEP\u2019s ownership in OVEC was 43.47%. Parent owns 39.17% and OPCo owns 4.3%. APCo, I&M and OPCo are members to an intercompany power agreement. The Registrants\u2019 power participation ratios are 15.69% for APCo, 7.85% for I&M and 19.93% for OPCo. Participants of this agreement are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC generating capacity, approximately 2,400 MWs, in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs, including outstanding indebtedness, and provide a return on capital. The intercompany power agreement ends in June 2040.\nAEP and other nonaffiliated owners authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests. OVEC financed capital expenditures in connection with the engineering and construction of FGD projects and the associated waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants. These environmental projects were funded through debt issuances. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, OVEC\u2019s outstanding indebtedness was approximately $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, the Registrants\u2019 are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC\u2019s outstanding debt through the intercompany power agreement. Principal and interest payments related to OVEC\u2019s outstanding indebtedness are disclosed in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cCommitments.\u201d See the \u201cCommitments\u201d section of Note 6 for additional information.\nAEP is not required to consolidate OVEC as it is not the primary beneficiary, although AEP and its subsidiary each hold a significant variable interest in OVEC. Power to control decision making that significantly impacts the economic performance of OVEC is shared amongst the owners through their representation on the Board of Directors of OVEC and the representation of the sponsoring companies on the Operating Committee under the intercompany power agreement.\nAEP\u2019s investment in OVEC was:\n(a)Based on the Registrants\u2019 power participation ratios, APCo, I&M and OPCo\u2019s share of OVEC debt was $168 million, $84 million and $213 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively and $173 million, $86 million and $219 million as of December 31, 2022, respectively.\nPower purchased by the Registrant Subsidiaries from OVEC is included in Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation and Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income and is shown in the table below:\nAEPSC (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries)\nAEPSC provides certain managerial and professional services to AEP\u2019s subsidiaries. Parent is the sole equity owner of AEPSC. AEP management controls the activities of AEPSC. The costs of the services are based on a direct-charge or on a prorated basis and billed to the AEP subsidiary companies at AEPSC\u2019s cost. AEP subsidiaries have not provided financial or other support outside of the reimbursement of costs for services rendered. AEPSC finances its operations through cost reimbursement from other AEP subsidiaries. There are no other terms or arrangements between AEPSC and any of the AEP subsidiaries that could require additional financial support from an AEP subsidiary or expose them to losses outside of the normal course of business. AEPSC and its billings are subject to regulation by the FERC. AEP subsidiaries are exposed to losses to the extent they cannot recover the costs of AEPSC through their normal business operations. AEP subsidiaries are considered to have a significant interest in AEPSC due to their activity in AEPSC\u2019s cost reimbursement structure. However, AEP subsidiaries do not have control over AEPSC. AEPSC is consolidated by AEP. In the event AEPSC would require financing or other support outside the cost reimbursement billings, this financing would be provided by AEP.\nTotal AEPSC billings to the Registrant Subsidiaries were as follows:\nThe carrying amount and classification of variable interest in AEPSC\u2019s accounts payable were as follows:\nAEGCo (Applies to I&M)\nAEGCo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, is consolidated by AEP. AEGCo owns a 50% ownership interest in Rockport Plant, Units 1 and 2. AEGCo sells its portion of the output from the Rockport Plant to I&M. AEP has agreed to provide AEGCo with the funds necessary to satisfy all of the debt obligations of AEGCo. I&M is considered to have a significant interest in AEGCo due to these transactions. I&M is exposed to losses to the extent it cannot recover the costs of AEGCo through its normal business operations. In the event AEGCo would require financing or other support outside the billings to I&M, this financing would be provided by AEP. Total billings to I&M from AEGCo for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $181 million, $242 million and $218 million, respectively. The carrying amounts of I&M\u2019s liabilities associated with AEGCo as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $15 million and $17 million, respectively. Management estimates the maximum exposure of loss to be equal to the amount of such liability.\nSignificant Equity Method Investment in Unconsolidated Entities (Applies to AEP)\nFor a discussion of the equity method of accounting, see the \u201cEquity Method Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\u201d section of Note 1.\nAEP Wind Holdings, LLC\nAs of December 31, 2023, AEP no longer owns interests in four joint ventures due to the sale of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio. Previously held by AEP Wind Holdings, LLC, the interests were accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2022, AEP\u2019s carrying value of the investment in the joint ventures was $247 million and the difference between AEP\u2019s carrying value and the amount of underlying equity in net assets was $62 million. The investment included amounts recognized in AOCI related to interest rate cash flow hedges. AEP\u2019s equity losses associated with the joint venture wind farms were $278 thousand, $194 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The PTCs attributable to the joint ventures for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material, which were recorded in Income Tax Expense (Benefit) on the statements of income. See the \u201cDisposition of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio\u201d and \u201cImpairments\u201d sections of Note 7 for additional information.\nETT\nETT designs, acquires, constructs, owns and operates certain transmission facilities in ERCOT. BHE, a nonaffiliated entity, holds a 50% membership interest in ETT and AEP Transmission Holdco holds a 50% membership interest in ETT. As a result, AEP, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, holds a 50% membership interest in ETT. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, AEP\u2019s investment in ETT was $811 million and $762 million, respectively. AEP\u2019s equity earnings associated with ETT were $74 million, $74 million and $66 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n18. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment is shown functionally on the face of the balance sheets. The following tables include the total plant balances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(a)AEP and SWEPCo\u2019s regulated generation and regulated CWIP include amounts related to SWEPCo\u2019s Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nThe Registrants provide for depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment, excluding coal-mining properties, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, generally using composite rates by functional class. The following tables provide total regulated annual composite depreciation rates and depreciable lives for the Registrants:\nAEPTCo\n2023 2022 2021\nFunctional Class of Property Annual Composite\nDepreciation Rate Depreciable\nLife Ranges Annual Composite\nDepreciation Rate Depreciable\nLife Ranges Annual Composite\nDepreciation Rate Depreciable\nLife Ranges\n(in years) (in years) (in years)\nTransmission 2.6% 24 - 78 2.6% 24 - 75 2.5% 24 - 75\nOther 7.0% 5 - 58 6.6% 5 - 56 6.7% 5 - 56\nThe following table includes the nonregulated annual composite depreciation rate ranges and nonregulated depreciable life ranges for AEP. The Registrants' depreciation rate ranges and depreciable life ranges are not meaningful for nonregulated property for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n(a)In 2020, management announced plans to retire the Pirkey Plant in 2023 and the related depreciable lives have been adjusted accordingly. Pirkey Plant was retired in March 2023. See \"Coal-Fired Generation Plants\" of Note 5 for additional information.\nNA Not applicable.\nFor regulated operations, the composite depreciation rate generally includes a component for non-ARO removal costs, which is credited to Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization on the balance sheets. Actual removal costs incurred are charged to Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization. Any excess of accrued non-ARO removal costs over actual removal costs incurred is reclassified from Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization and reflected as a regulatory liability. For nonregulated operations, non-ARO removal costs are expensed as incurred.\nAsset Retirement Obligations (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)\nThe Registrants recorded the following revisions to ARO estimates as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\u2022As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, I&M\u2019s ARO liability for nuclear decommissioning of the Cook Plant was $2.11 billion and $2 billion, respectively. These liabilities are reflected in Asset Retirement Obligations on I&M\u2019s balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of I&M\u2019s assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling decommissioning liabilities totaled $3.51 billion and $3.01 billion, respectively. These assets are included in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on I&M\u2019s balance sheets.\n\u2022In September 2022, APCo recorded a $14 million revision due to an increase in estimated ash pond closure costs at the Amos Plant.\n\u2022In March 2022, PSO and SWEPCo acquired respective undivided ownership interests in the entity that owned Traverse during its development and construction. Immediately following the acquisition, PSO and SWEPCo liquidated the entity and simultaneously distributed the Traverse assets in proportion to their undivided ownership interests. Traverse was placed in-service in March 2022. As a result, PSO and SWEPCo incurred additional ARO liabilities of $13 million and $15 million, respectively. See the \u201cNorth Central Wind Energy Facilities\u201d section of Note 7 for additional information.\n\u2022In March 2022, SWEPCo recorded a $13 million revision due to an increase in estimated ash pond closure costs at the Pirkey Plant and the Welsh Plant. In June 2022, SWEPCo recorded a $16 million revision due to an increase in estimated reclamation costs at Sabine. In September 2022, SWEPCo recorded a $14 million revision due to an\nincrease in estimated landfill closure costs at Pirkey Plant. In November 2022, SWEPCo recorded an additional $7 million revision related to an increase in estimated reclamation costs at Sabine.\n\u2022In August 2023, AEP completed the sale of its competitive contracted renewables portfolio to a nonaffiliated party and settled ARO liabilities of $31 million.

A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to a customer. The invoice practical expedient within the accounting guidance for \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d allows for the recognition of revenue from performance obligations in the amount of consideration to which there is a right to invoice the customer and when the amount for which there is a right to invoice corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\nThe purpose of the invoice practical expedient is to depict an entity\u2019s measure of progress toward completion of the performance obligation within a contract and can only be applied to performance obligations that are satisfied over time and when the invoice is representative of services provided to date. AEP subsidiaries elected to apply the invoice practical expedient to recognize revenue for performance obligations satisfied over time as the invoices from the respective revenue streams are representative of services or goods provided to date to the customer. Performance obligations for AEP\u2019s subsidiaries are summarized as follows:\nRetail Revenues\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution Utilities segments have performance obligations to generate, transmit and distribute electricity for sale to rate-regulated retail customers. The performance obligation to deliver electricity is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. Revenues are variable as they are subject to the customer\u2019s usage requirements.\nRate-regulated retail customers typically have the right to discontinue receiving service at will, therefore these contracts between AEP\u2019s subsidiaries and their customers for rate-regulated services are generally limited to the services requested and received to date for such arrangements. Retail customers are generally billed on a monthly basis, and payment is typically due within 15 to 20 days after the issuance of the invoice. Payments from REPs are due to AEP Texas within 35 days.\nWholesale Revenues - Generation\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Generation & Marketing segments have performance obligations to sell electricity to wholesale customers from generation assets in PJM, SPP and ERCOT. The performance obligation to deliver electricity from generation assets is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. Wholesale generation revenues are variable as they are subject to the customer\u2019s usage requirements.\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Generation & Marketing segments also have performance obligations to stand ready in order to promote grid reliability. Stand ready services are sold into PJM\u2019s RPM capacity market. RPM entails a base auction and at least three incremental auctions for a specific PJM delivery year, with the incremental auctions spanning three years. The performance obligation to stand ready is satisfied over time and the consideration for which is variable until the occurrence of the final incremental auction, at which point the performance obligation becomes fixed.\nPayments from the RTO for stand ready services are typically received within one week from the issuance of the invoice, which is typically issued weekly. Gross margin resulting from generation sales within the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment are primarily subject to margin sharing agreements with customers and vary by state, where the revenues are reflected gross in the disaggregated revenues tables above.\nAPCo has a performance obligation to supply wholesale electricity to KGPCo through a PPA. The FERC regulates the cost-based wholesale power transactions between APCo and KGPCo. The purchased power agreement includes a component for the recovery of transmission costs under the FERC OATT. The transmission cost component of purchased power is cost-based and regulated by the Tennessee Regulatory Authority. APCo\u2019s performance obligation under the purchased power agreement is satisfied over time as KGPCo simultaneously receives and consumes the wholesale electricity. APCo\u2019s revenues from the purchased power agreement are presented within the Generation Revenues line in the disaggregated revenues tables above.\nWholesale Revenues - Transmission\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Vertically Integrated Utilities, Transmission and Distribution Utilities and AEP Transmission Holdco segments have performance obligations to transmit electricity to wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP subsidiaries. The performance obligation to provide transmission services in PJM, SPP and ERCOT is partially fixed for a period of one year or less. Payments from the RTO for transmission services are typically received within one week from the issuance of the invoice, which is issued monthly for SPP and ERCOT and weekly for PJM.\nAEP subsidiaries within the PJM and SPP regions collect revenues through transmission formula rates. The FERC-approved rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners. The formula rates establish rates for a one year period and also include a true-up calculation for the prior year\u2019s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner\u2019s ATRR. The annual true-ups meet the definition of alternative revenues in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRegulated Operations,\u201d and are therefore presented as such in the disaggregated revenues tables above. AEP subsidiaries within the ERCOT region collect revenues through a combination of base rates and interim Transmission Costs of Services filings that are approved by the PUCT.\nThe AEP East Companies are parties to the TA, which defines how transmission costs are allocated among the AEP East Companies on a 12-month average coincident peak basis. PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA by and among PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC, in connection with the operation of the transmission assets of the two AEP utility subsidiaries. AEPTCo is a transmission owner within the PJM and SPP regions providing transmission services to affiliates in accordance with the OATT, TA and TCA. Affiliate revenues as a result of the respective TA and the TCA are reflected as Transmission Revenues in the disaggregated revenues tables above.\nMarketing, Competitive Retail and Renewable Revenues\nAEP\u2019s subsidiaries within the Generation & Marketing segment have performance obligations to deliver electricity to competitive retail and wholesale customers. Performance obligations for marketing, competitive retail and renewable offtake sales are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. Revenues are primarily variable as they are subject to customer\u2019s usage requirements; however, certain contracts mandate a delivery of a set quantity of electricity at a predetermined price, resulting in a fixed performance obligation.\nPayment terms under marketing arrangements typically follow standard Edison Electric Institute and International Swaps and Derivatives Association terms, which call for payment in 20 days. Payments for competitive retail and offtake arrangements for renewable assets range from 15 to 60 days and are dependent on the product sold, location and the creditworthiness of customer. Invoices for marketing arrangements, competitive retail and offtake arrangements for renewable assets are issued monthly.\nFixed Performance Obligations (Applies to AEP, APCo and I&M)\nThe following table represents the Registrants\u2019 remaining fixed performance obligations satisfied over time as of December 31, 2023. Fixed performance obligations primarily include electricity sales for fixed amounts of energy and stand ready services into PJM\u2019s RPM market. The Registrants elected to apply the exemption to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected term of one year or less. Due to the annual establishment of revenue requirements, transmission revenues are excluded from the table below. The Registrant Subsidiaries amounts shown in the table below include affiliated and nonaffiliated revenues.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets are recognized when the Registrants have a right to consideration that is conditional upon the occurrence of an event other than the passage of time, such as future performance under a contract. The Registrants did not have any material contract assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWhen the Registrants receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract, they recognize a contract liability on the balance sheet in the amount of that consideration. Revenue for such consideration is subsequently recognized in the period or periods in which the remaining performance obligations in the contract are satisfied. The Registrants\u2019 contract liabilities typically arise from services provided under joint use agreements for utility poles. The Registrants did not have any material contract liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAccounts Receivable from Contracts with Customers\nAccounts receivable from contracts with customers are presented on the Registrants\u2019 balance sheets within the Accounts Receivable - Customers line item. The Registrants\u2019 balances for receivables from contracts that are not recognized in accordance with the accounting guidance for \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d included in Accounts Receivable - Customers were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. See \u201cSecuritized Accounts Receivable - AEP Credit\u201d section of Note 14 for additional information.\nThe following table represents the amount of affiliated accounts receivable from contracts with customers included in Accounts Receivable - Affiliated Companies on the Registrant Subsidiaries\u2019 balance sheets:\nYears Ended December 31, AEP Texas AEPTCo APCo I&M OPCo PSO SWEPCo\n(in millions)\n2023 $ - $ 123.2 $ 71.7 $ 44.0 $ 70.1 $ 12.4 $ 27.4\n2022 0.1 113.8 64.5 75.3 49.9 18.8 19.1\nContract Costs\nContract costs to obtain or fulfill a contract for AEP subsidiaries within the Generation & Marketing segment are accounted for under the guidance for \u201cOther Assets and Deferred Costs\u201d and presented as a single asset and are neither bifurcated nor reclassified between current and noncurrent assets on the Registrants\u2019 balance sheets. Contract costs to acquire a contract are amortized in a manner consistent with the transfer of goods or services to the customer in Other Operation on the Registrants\u2019 income statements. The Registrants did not have material contract costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.",
