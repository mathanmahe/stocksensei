    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nLinde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland with its principal offices in the United Kingdom. Linde plc was formed in 2017 in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement, dated June 1, 2017, as amended, between Linde plc, Praxair, Inc. (\"Praxair\") and Linde Aktiengesellschaft (\"Linde AG\"). Effective October 31, 2018, the business combination was completed and Linde plc is comprised of the businesses of Praxair and Linde AG (hereinafter the combined group will be referred to as \"the company\" or \"Linde\").\nThe business combination brought together two leading companies in the global industrial gases industry, leveraging the proven strengths of each. Linde believes the merger will combine Linde AG\u2019s long-held expertise in technology with Praxair\u2019s efficient operating model, thus creating a global leader. The company is expected to have strong positions in key geographies and end markets that will create a more diverse and balanced global portfolio.\nLinde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. Its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene). The company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases primarily for internal use and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals, electronics and water treatment.\nIn 2018, the company, Praxair and Linde AG entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy antitrust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination. These agreements required the sale of the majority of Praxair's European industrial gases business (completed on December 3, 2018), the majority of Linde AG's Americas industrial gases business (completed on March 1, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's South Korea industrial gases business (completed April 30, 2019), select assets of Praxair's Indian industrial gases business (completed July 12, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's Indian industrial gases business (completed December 16, 2019) as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia that are expected to be sold in 2020. As of December 31, 2018 and until the completion of the majority of such divestitures, Linde AG and Praxair were obligated to operate their businesses globally as separate and independent companies, and not coordinate any of their commercial operations. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (\u201cFTC\u201d) hold separate order (\u201cHSO\u201d) restrictions were lifted March 1, 2019, concurrent with the sale of the required merger-related divestitures in the United States. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to divestitures.\nPraxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Praxair for the periods prior to the business combination are considered to be the historical financial statements of the company. The results of Linde AG are included in Linde's consolidated results from the date of the completion of the business combination forward. During 2018, the company reported its continuing operations in six reporting segments under which it managed its operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings: North America, South America, Asia, Europe, Surface Technologies and Linde AG. Effective with the lifting of the hold separate order on March 1, 2019, new operating segments were established. Linde\u2019s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represents three of the company's new reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses, which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation.\nLinde\u2019s sales were $28,228 million, $14,836 million, and $11,358 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Linde\u2019s reportable segments.\nIndustrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes\nAtmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Linde. Using air as its raw material, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Rare gases, such as krypton, neon and xenon, are also produced through cryogenic air separation. As a pioneer\nin the industrial gases industry, Linde is a leader in developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and supply systems technology. Linde also led the development and commercialization of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. These technologies open important new markets and optimize production capacity for the company by lowering the cost of supplying industrial gases. These technologies include proprietary vacuum pressure swing adsorption (\u201cVPSA\u201d) and membrane separation to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen, respectively.\nProcess gases, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by methods other than air separation. Most carbon dioxide is purchased from by-product sources, including chemical plants, refineries and industrial processes or is recovered from carbon dioxide wells. Carbon dioxide is processed in Linde\u2019s plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming or auto-thermal reforming of natural gas or other feed streams such as naphtha. Hydrogen is also produced by purifying by-product sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water.\nIndustrial Gases Distribution\nThere are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer\u2019s needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product (typically oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen) and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers\u2019 sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Advanced air separation processes allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements. Customers using these systems usually enter into requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from ten to twenty years.\nMerchant. The merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and helium. The deliveries generally are made from Linde\u2019s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site which are owned and maintained by Linde and leased to the customer. Due to distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to seven-year requirement contracts.\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Packaged gases include atmospheric gases, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, acetylene and related products. Linde also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer\u2019s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and through purchase orders.\nA substantial amount of the cylinder gases sold in the United States are distributed by independent distributors that buy merchant gases in liquid form and repackage the products in their facilities. Packaged gas distributors, including Linde, also distribute hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Over time, Linde has acquired a number of independent industrial gases and welding products distributors at various locations in the United States and continues to sell merchant gases to other independent distributors. Between its own distribution business, joint ventures and sales to independent distributors, Linde is represented in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\nEngineering\nLinde\u2019s Engineering business has a global presence, with its focus on market segments such as olefin, natural gas, air separation, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants. The company utilizes its own extensive process engineering know-how in the planning, project development and construction of turnkey industrial plants and associated services. Linde plants are used in a wide variety of fields: in the petrochemical and chemical industries, in refineries and fertilizer plants, to recover air gases, to produce hydrogen and synthesis gases, to treat natural gas and to produce noble gases. The Engineering business either supplies plant components and services directly to the customer or to the industrial gas business of Linde which operates the plants on behalf of the customer under a long-term gases supply contract.\nInventories - Linde carries inventories of merchant and cylinder gases, hardgoods and coatings materials to supply products to its customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. On-site plants and pipeline complexes have limited inventory. Inventory obsolescence is not material to Linde\u2019s business.\nCustomers - Linde is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers.\nInternational - Linde is a global enterprise with approximately 70% of its 2019 sales outside of the United States. The company also has majority or wholly owned subsidiaries that operate in approximately 45 European, Middle Eastern and African countries (including Germany, France, Sweden, the Republic of South Africa, and the United Kingdom); approximately 20 Asian and South Pacific countries (including China, Taiwan, India and Australia); and approximately 20 countries in North and South America (including Canada, Mexico and Brazil).\nThe company also has equity method investments operating in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and North America.\nLinde\u2019s international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, import and export controls, and other economic, political and regulatory policies of local governments. Also, see Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nSeasonality - Linde\u2019s business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant extent.\nResearch and Development - Linde\u2019s research and development is directed toward development of gas processing, separation and liquefaction technologies, improving distribution of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases. This results in the development of new advanced air separation, hydrogen, synthesis gas, natural gas, adsorption and chemical process technologies as well as the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications. Research and development is primarily conducted at Pullach, Germany, Tonawanda, New York, Burr Ridge, Illinois and Shanghai, China.\nPatents and Trademarks - Linde owns or licenses a large number of patents that relate to a wide variety of products and processes. Linde\u2019s patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. While these patents and licenses are considered important to its individual businesses, Linde does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any one particular patent, or patent license, or family of patents. Linde also owns a large number of trademarks, of which the \"Linde\" trademark is the most significant.\nRaw Materials and Energy Costs - Energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. Most of Linde\u2019s energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. The company mitigates electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-through and tolling arrangements.\nThe supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where the company conducts business. However, energy availability and price is unpredictable and may pose unforeseen future risks.\nFor carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, helium, hydrogen, specialty gases and surface technologies, raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources. Linde has contracts or commitments for, or readily available sources of, most of these raw materials; however, their long-term availability and prices are subject to market conditions.\nCompetition - Linde participates in highly competitive markets in the industrial gases, engineering and healthcare businesses, which are characterized by a mixture of local, regional and global players, all of which exert competitive pressure on the parties. In locations where Linde has pipeline networks, which enable the company to provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers, Linde derives a competitive advantage.\nCompetitors in the industrial and medical gases industry include global and regional companies such as L\u2019Air Liquide S.A., Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Messer Group GmbH, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation (through Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation) as well as an extensive number of small to medium size independent industrial gas companies which compete locally as producers or distributors. In addition, a significant portion of the international gases market relates to customer-owned plants.\nEmployees and Labor Relations - As of December 31, 2019, Linde had 79,886 employees worldwide. Linde has collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations throughout the world, which expire at various dates. Linde considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory.\nEnvironment - Information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section captioned \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - Environmental Matters\u201d in Item 7 of this 10-K.\nAvailable Information - The company makes its periodic and current reports available, free of charge, on or through its website, www.linde.com, as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nDue to the size and geographic reach of the company\u2019s operations, a wide range of factors, many of which are outside of the company\u2019s control, could materially affect the company\u2019s future operations and financial performance. Management believes the following risks may significantly impact the company:\nThe company may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the business combination.\nThe company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the business combination between Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG, which was completed on October 31, 2018. The success of the business combination will depend on, among other things, the company\u2019s ability to combine Praxair, Inc.\u2019s and Linde AG\u2019s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth and realizes the anticipated annual synergies and cost reductions without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. The actual integration will continue to involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. Difficulties in the integration of the businesses, which may result in significant costs and delays, include:\n\u2022\nmanaging a significantly larger combined group;\n\u2022\naligning and executing the strategy of the company;\n\u2022\nintegrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers and coordinating distribution and marketing efforts in geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022\ncoordinating corporate and administrative infrastructures and aligning insurance coverage;\n\u2022\ncoordinating accounting, reporting, information technology, communications, administration and other systems;\n\u2022\naddressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nthe company being subject to Irish laws and regulations and legal action in Ireland;\n\u2022\ncoordinating the compliance program and uniform financial reporting, information technology and other standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe implementation, ultimate impact and outcome of post-completion reorganization transactions, which may be delayed;\n\u2022\nunforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the business combination or the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nmanaging tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations;\n\u2022\nidentifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets; and\n\u2022\neffecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.\nThese and other factors could result in increased costs and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the business combination may also adversely affect the company\u2019s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and others with whom Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses could harm the reputation of the company.\nIf the company is not able to successfully integrate the businesses of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the business combination may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWeakening economic conditions in markets in which Linde does business may adversely impact its financial results and/or cash flows.\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries across more than 100 countries, which generally leads to financial stability through various business cycles. However, a broad decline in general economic or business conditions in the industries served by its customers could adversely affect the demand for Linde\u2019s products and impair the ability of its customers to satisfy their obligations to Linde, resulting in uncollected receivables and/or unanticipated contract terminations or project delays. For example, global political and economic uncertainty could reduce investment activities of Linde\u2019s customers, which could adversely affect Linde\u2019s business.\nIn addition, many of Linde\u2019s customers are in businesses that are cyclical in nature, such as the chemicals, electronics, metals and energy industries. Downturns in these industries may adversely impact Linde during these cycles. Additionally, such conditions could impact the utilization of Linde\u2019s manufacturing capacity which may require it to\nrecognize impairment losses on tangible assets such as property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets such as goodwill, customer relationships or intellectual property.\nIncreases in the cost of energy and raw materials and/or disruption in the supply of these materials could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.\nEnergy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. Most of Linde\u2019s energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. Linde attempts to minimize the financial impact of variability in these costs through the management of customer contracts and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency. Large customer contracts typically have escalation and pass-through clauses to recover energy and feedstock costs. Such attempts may not successfully mitigate cost variability, which could negatively impact Linde\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. The supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where Linde conducts business. However, regional energy conditions are unpredictable and may pose future risk.\nFor carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, helium, hydrogen, specialty gases and surface technologies, raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources. Where feasible, Linde sources several of these raw materials, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen and calcium carbide, as chemical or industrial byproducts. In addition, Linde has contracts or commitments for, or readily available sources of, most of these raw materials; however, their long-term availability and prices are subject to market conditions. A disruption in supply of such raw materials could impact Linde\u2019s ability to meet contractual supply commitments.\nLinde\u2019s international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad and international events and circumstances may adversely impact its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLinde has substantial international operations which are subject to risks including devaluations in currency exchange rates, transportation delays and interruptions, political and economic instability and disruptions, restrictions on the transfer of funds, trade conflicts and the imposition of duties and tariffs, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest, possible nationalization and/or expropriation of assets, domestic and international tax laws and compliance with governmental regulations. These events could have an adverse effect on the international operations of Linde in the future by reducing the demand for its products, decreasing the prices at which it can sell its products, reducing the revenue from international operations or otherwise having an adverse effect on its business. For example, Linde has a meaningful presence in the U.K. and the U.K.\u2019s ongoing exit process from the EU has continued to cause, and may in the future cause, political and economic uncertainty, which could have an adverse impact on the markets which Linde supplies.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect Linde's results.\nBecause a significant portion of Linde's revenue is denominated in currencies other than its reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in revenue, costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of assets and liabilities and related equity. Although the company from time to time utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures, its efforts to minimize currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect Linde\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMacroeconomic factors may impact Linde\u2019s ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may adversely impact Linde\u2019s financial results and/or cash flows.\nVolatility and disruption in the U.S., European and global credit and equity markets, from time to time, could make it more difficult for Linde to obtain financing for its operations and/or could increase the cost of obtaining financing. In addition, Linde\u2019s borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on its performance as measured by certain criteria such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these debt ratings could increase the cost of borrowing or make it more difficult to obtain financing.\nAn impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company's financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the net carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $27 billion and $2 billion, respectively, primarily as a result of the business combination and the related acquisition method of accounting applied to Linde AG. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the company periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinite-lived assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on Linde's results of operations in the periods recognized.\nCatastrophic events could disrupt the operations of Linde and/or its customers and suppliers and may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events or natural disasters such as extreme weather, including hurricanes and floods; health epidemics; and acts of war or terrorism, could disrupt or delay Linde\u2019s ability to produce and distribute its products to customers and could potentially expose Linde to third-party liability claims. In addition, such events could impact Linde\u2019s customers and suppliers resulting in temporary or long-term outages and/or the limitation of supply of energy and other raw materials used in normal business operations. Linde evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, consults with vendors, insurance providers and industry experts, makes investments in suitably resilient design and technology, and conducts regular reviews of the business risks with management. Despite these steps, however, these situations are outside Linde\u2019s control and may have a significant adverse impact on its financial results.\nThe inability to attract and retain qualified personnel may adversely impact Linde\u2019s business.\nIf Linde fails to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, it may not be able to develop, market or sell its products or successfully manage its business. Linde is dependent upon a highly skilled, experienced and efficient workforce to be successful. Much of Linde\u2019s competitive advantage is based on the expertise and experience of key personnel regarding marketing, technology, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure, systems and products. The inability to attract and hire qualified individuals or the loss of key employees in very skilled areas could have a negative effect on Linde\u2019s financial results.\nIf Linde fails to keep pace with technological advances in the industry or if new technology initiatives do not become commercially accepted, customers may not continue to buy Linde\u2019s products and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLinde\u2019s research and development is directed toward developing new and improved methods for the production and distribution of industrial gases, the design and construction of plants and toward developing new markets and applications for the use of industrial and process gases. This results in the introduction of new applications and the development of new advanced air separation process technologies. As a result of these efforts, Linde develops new and proprietary technologies and employs necessary measures to protect such technologies within the global geographies in which Linde operates. These technologies help Linde to create a competitive advantage and to provide a platform to grow its business. If Linde\u2019s research and development activities do not keep pace with competitors or if Linde does not create new technologies that benefit customers, future results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks related to pension benefit plans may adversely impact Linde\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nPension benefits represent significant financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to Linde\u2019s plans. Linde utilizes the services of independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in the actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, significant changes in actual investment returns on pension assets, discount rates, or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations and required pension contributions.\nOperational risks may adversely impact Linde\u2019s business or results of operations.\nLinde\u2019s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer contract requirements and other needs. Insufficient or excess capacity threatens Linde\u2019s ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose Linde to liabilities related to contract commitments. Operating results are also dependent on Linde\u2019s ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget and in accordance with performance requirements. Failure to do so may expose Linde\u2019s business to loss of revenue, potential litigation and loss of business reputation.\nAlso inherent in the management of Linde\u2019s production facilities and delivery systems, including storage, vehicle transportation and pipelines, are operational risks that require continuous training, oversight and control. Material operating failures at production, storage facilities or pipelines, including fire, toxic release and explosions, or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, loss of production and/or extensive property damage, all of which may negatively impact Linde\u2019s financial results.\nLinde may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nLinde relies on information technology systems and networks for business and operational activities, and also stores and processes sensitive business and proprietary information in these systems and networks. These systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, break-ins and similar events, or breaches of security.\nLinde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency and recovery process. Despite these steps, however, operational failures and breaches of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information, result in business interruption or malfunction or regulatory actions and have a material adverse impact on Linde\u2019s operations, reputation and financial results.\nThe inability to effectively integrate acquisitions or collaborate with joint venture partners could adversely impact Linde\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition to the business combination, Linde has evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. Many of these transactions, if consummated, could be material to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired company, business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Although historically Linde has been successful with its acquisition strategy and execution, the areas where Linde may face risks include:\n\u2022\nthe need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating existing business to acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into the existing organization;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate each company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty with the assimilation of acquired operations and products;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve targeted synergies and cost reductions; and\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees and business relationships of acquired companies.\nForeign acquisitions and joint ventures involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned herein, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nAlso, the anticipated benefit of potential future acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or impairments of goodwill, any of which could adversely impact Linde\u2019s financial results.\nLinde is subject to a variety of international laws and government regulations and changes in, or failure to comply with, these laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nLinde is subject to regulations in the following areas, among others:\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection, including climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international tax laws and currency controls;\n\u2022\nsafety;\n\u2022\nsecurities laws applicable in the United States, the European Union, Germany, Ireland, and other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ntrade and import/export restrictions, as well as economic sanctions laws;\n\u2022\nantitrust matters;\n\u2022\ndata protection;\n\u2022\nglobal anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n\u2022\nhealthcare regulations.\nChanges in these or other regulatory areas, such as evolving environmental legislation in China, may impact Linde\u2019s profitability and may give rise to new or increased compliance risks: it may become more complex and costly to ensure compliance, and the level of sanctions in the event of non-compliance may rise. Such changes may also restrict Linde\u2019s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or sanctions, cancellation of marketing rights or restrictions on participation in, or even exclusion from, public tender proceedings, all of which could have a material adverse impact on Linde\u2019s financial results and/or reputation.\nDoing business globally requires Linde to comply with anti-corruption, trade, compliance and economic sanctions and similar laws, and to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that its employees and other intermediaries comply with the applicable restrictions. These restrictions include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products, services and any other economic resources to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. Compliance with these restrictions requires, among other things, screening of business partners. Despite its commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics, the company cannot ensure that its policies and procedures will always protect it from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by employees or agents under the applicable laws. If Linde fails to comply with laws governing the conduct of international operations, Linde may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially adversely affect its reputation, business and results of operations.\nThe outcome of litigation or governmental investigations may adversely impact the company\u2019s business or results of operations.\nLinde\u2019s subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of business. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect Linde\u2019s ability to conduct business. Linde and its subsidiaries may in the future become subject to further claims and litigation, which is impossible to predict. The litigation and other claims Linde faces are subject to inherent uncertainties. Legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements might give rise to expenses which are not covered, or are not fully covered, by insurance benefits and may also lead to negative publicity and reputational damage. An unfavorable outcome or determination could cause a material adverse impact on the company\u2019s results of operations.\nPotential product defects or inadequate customer care may adversely impact Linde\u2019s business or results of operations.\nRisks associated with products and services may result in potential liability claims, the loss of customers or damage to Linde\u2019s reputation. Principal possible causes of risks associated with products and services are product defects or an inadequate level of customer care when Linde is providing services.\nLinde is exposed to legal risks relating to product liability in the countries where it operates, including countries such as the United States, where legal risks (in particular through class actions) have historically been more significant than in other countries. The outcome of any pending or future products and services proceedings or investigations cannot be predicted and legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements may give rise to significant losses, costs and expenses.\nThe manufacturing and sale of products as well as the construction of plants by Linde may give rise to risks associated with the production, filling, storage, handling and transport of raw materials, goods or waste. Industrial gases are\npotentially hazardous substances and medical gases and the related healthcare services must comply with the relevant specifications in order to not adversely affect the health of patients treated with them.\nLinde\u2019s products and services, if defective or not handled or performed appropriately, may lead to personal injuries, business interruptions, environmental damages or other significant damages, which may result, among other consequences, in liability, losses, monetary penalties or compensation payments, environmental clean-up costs or other costs and expenses, exclusion from certain market sectors deemed important for future development of the business and loss of reputation. All these consequences could have a material adverse effect on Linde\u2019s business and results of operations.\nU.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against Linde.\nLinde is organized under the laws of Ireland and substantial portions of its assets will be located outside of the United States. In addition, certain directors and officers of Linde and its subsidiaries reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon Linde or such persons, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws.\nA judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the United States based on civil liability would not be automatically enforceable in Ireland. There is no treaty between Ireland and the United States providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. The following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in Ireland (i) the judgment must be for a definite sum, (ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive; and (iii) the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nAn Irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment (i) was obtained by fraud; (ii) violated Irish public policy; (iii) is in breach of natural justice; or (iv) if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment.\nIn addition, there is doubt as to whether an Irish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability on Linde or such persons in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Ireland against Linde or such member, officer or expert, respectively.\nChanges in tax laws or policy could adversely impact the company\u2019s financial position or results of operations.\nLinde and its subsidiaries are subject to the tax rules and regulations in the U.S., Germany, Ireland, the U.K. and other countries in which they operate. Those tax rules and regulations are subject to change on a prospective or retroactive basis. Under current economic and political conditions, including the U.K.\u2019s ongoing exit process from the EU, tax rates and policies in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., the U.K. and the EU, are subject to significant change. In particular, since Linde is currently treated as U.K. tax resident, any potential changes in the tax rules applying to U.K. tax-resident companies would directly affect Linde.\nA change in Linde\u2019s tax residency could have a negative effect on the company\u2019s future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges. If Linde ceases to be resident in the United Kingdom and becomes resident in another jurisdiction, it may be subject to United Kingdom exit charges, and/or could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction. If Linde were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction, it could be subject to duplicative taxation. Furthermore, although Linde is incorporated in Ireland and is not expected to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is possible that the IRS could disagree with this result or that changes in U.S. federal income tax law could alter this result. If the IRS successfully asserted such a position or the law were to change, significant adverse tax consequences may result for Linde, the company and Linde\u2019s shareholders.\nWhen tax rules change, this may result in a higher tax expense and the need to make higher tax payments. In addition, changes in tax legislation may have a significant impact on Linde\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 tax receivables and tax liabilities as well as on their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and uncertainty about the tax environment in some regions may restrict their opportunities to enforce their respective rights under the law. Linde also operates in countries with complex tax regulations which could be interpreted in different ways. Interpretations of these regulations or changes in the tax system might have an adverse impact on the tax liabilities, profitability and business operations of\nLinde. Linde and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic audits by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions or other review actions by the relevant financial or tax authorities. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in Linde\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements and may materially affect their respective financial results for the period when such determination is made.",

Linde also owns principal administrative office space in Danbury, Connecticut and Houston, Texas, United States; Pullach, Germany; and Singapore.\nDue to the nature of Linde\u2019s industrial gas products, it is generally uneconomical to transport them distances greater than a few hundred miles from the production facility. As a result, Linde operates a significant number of production facilities spread globally throughout a number of geographic regions.\nThe following is a description of production facilities for Linde by segment. No significant portion of these assets was leased at December 31, 2019. Generally, these facilities are fully utilized and are sufficient to meet the company's manufacturing needs.\nAmericas\nThe Americas segment operates production facilities primarily in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil, approximately 350 of which are mainly cryogenic air separation plants, hydrogen plants and carbon dioxide plants. There are five major pipeline complexes in North America located in northern Indiana, Houston, along the Gulf Coast of Texas, Detroit and Louisiana. Many of the South American plants support one pipeline complex in Southern Brazil. Also located throughout the Americas are noncryogenic air separation plants, packaged gas facilities and other smaller plant facilities.\nEMEA\nThe EMEA segment has production facilities primarily in Italy, Spain, Germany, the Benelux region, the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and Russia which include approximately 230 cryogenic air separation plants and carbon dioxide plants. Also located throughout Europe are noncryogenic air separation plants, packaged gas facilities and other smaller plant facilities.\nAPAC\nThe APAC segment has production facilities located primarily in China, Korea, India and Thailand, approximately 230 of which are cryogenic air separation plants and carbon dioxide plants. Also located throughout Asia are noncryogenic air separation plants, hydrogen, packaged gas and other production facilities.\nEngineering\nThe Linde Engineering business designs and constructs turnkey process plants for third-party customers as well as for the Linde gases businesses in many locations worldwide, such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants.

AND LINDE AG\nLinde plc (\"Linde\") is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland in 2017 in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement between Praxair, Inc. (\"Praxair\") and Linde Aktiengesellschaft (\"Linde AG\"). On October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction, and became subsidiaries of Linde plc (collectively referred to as the \u201cbusiness combination\u201d or \"merger\"). The business combination of Praxair and Linde AG has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d with Praxair representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Praxair for the periods prior to the merger are considered to be the historical financial statements of Linde. The results of Linde AG are included in Linde\u2019s consolidated results from the merger date forward. The Linde shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cLIN\u201d. See Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nIn connection with the business combination, the company, Praxair and Linde AG, entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy anti-trust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination. These agreements required the sale of the majority of Praxair\u2019s European businesses (completed on December 3, 2018), a significant portion of Linde AG\u2019s Americas business (completed on March 1, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's South Korean industrial gases business (completed April 30, 2019), select assets of Praxair's Indian industrial gases business (completed July 12, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's Indian industrial gases business (completed December 16, 2019) as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia that are currently expected to be sold in 2020 (collectively, the \u201cmerger-related divestitures\u201d). In the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Praxair\u2019s merger-related divestitures are included in the results of operations until sold and Linde AG\u2019s merger-related divestitures are accounted for as discontinued operations. See Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information relating to merger-related divestitures.\nAdditionally, to obtain merger approval in the United States Linde, Praxair and Linde AG entered into an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission dated October 1, 2018 (\u201chold separate order\u201d or \u201cHSO\u201d). Under the HSO, the company, Praxair and Linde AG agreed to continue to operate Linde AG and Praxair as independent, ongoing, economically viable, competitive businesses held separate, distinct, and apart from each other\u2019s operations; and not coordinate any aspect of their operations until certain divestitures in the United States were completed. Accordingly, Linde had accounted for Linde AG as a separate segment for 2018 reporting purposes effective with the merger date. Prior to the merger date, the company\u2019s Linde AG segment did not exist. Since the FTC hold separate order restrictions were lifted effective March 1, 2019, the company subsequently implemented a new segment structure as follows: Americas; EMEA\n(Europe/Middle East/Africa); APAC (Asia/South Pacific) and Engineering. This new management organization structure was implemented during the first quarter 2019 and, accordingly, segment information has been retrospectively recast for all prior periods.\nITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\nBecause Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses effective with the merger date of October 31, 2018, the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the results and cash flows of the combined business, while the year ended December 31, 2018 includes twelve months of Praxair and two months of Linde AG. Due to the size of Linde AG\u2019s businesses prior to the merger, the reported results for 2019 and 2018 periods are not comparable. The balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are comparable because both periods reflect the merger.\nPro Forma Income Statement Information\nTherefore, to assist with a discussion of the 2019 and 2018 results on a comparable basis, certain supplemental unaudited pro forma income statement information is provided on both a consolidated and segment basis (referred to as \"pro forma income statement information\" or \"pro forma information\").\nThe pro forma information has been prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, assuming the merger and merger-related divestitures had been consummated on January 1, 2018. In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma Adjustments that are (i) directly attributable to the business combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity\u2019s consolidated results. The pro forma information is based on management's assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes and does not purport to represent what the results of operations would actually have been if the business combination and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the dates indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. Pro forma information was not developed for the year ended December 31, 2017. Also, the pro forma information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the business combination or any related restructuring costs.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWith the merger, Linde is the leading industrial gas company worldwide. The company's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). The company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases primarily for internal use; and offers its customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.\nLinde\u2019s industrial gas operations are managed on a geographical basis and in 2019 83% of sales were generated by Linde's three geographic segments (Americas, EMEA and APAC) and the remaining 17% is related primarily to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent Other (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for operating segment details).\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, petroleum refining, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment. The diversity of end-markets supports financial stability for Linde in varied business cycles.\nLinde generates most of its revenues and earnings in the following twelve geographies where the company has its strongest market positions and where distribution and production operations allow the company to deliver the highest level of service to its customers at the lowest cost.\nNorth and South America (\"Americas\")\nEurope, Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d)\nAsia and Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d)\nUnited States\nGermany\nChina & Taiwan\nBrazil\nUnited Kingdom\nAustralia\nMexico\nEastern Europe\nSouth Korea\nCanada\nIndia\nThe company manufactures and distributes its industrial gas products through networks of thousands of production plants, pipeline complexes, distribution centers and delivery vehicles. Major pipeline complexes are primarily located in the United States. These networks are a competitive advantage, providing the foundation of reliable product supply to the company\u2019s customer base. The majority of Linde\u2019s business is conducted through long-term contracts which provide stability in cash flow and the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers. The company has growth opportunities in all major geographies and in diverse end-markets such as energy, electronics, chemicals, metals, healthcare, food and beverage, and aerospace.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY - FINANCIAL RESULTS & OUTLOOK\n2019 Year in review\nOn October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock merger transaction, and became subsidiaries of Linde plc. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018.\n\u2022\nSales of $28,228 million were 90% above 2018 sales of $14,836 million, primarily driven by the merger that contributed 89% to sales, net of divestitures. Underlying sales increased 1% driven by 3% higher pricing across all geographic segments and 1% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and lower cost pass-through.\n\u2022\nReported operating profit of $2,933 million was 44% below 2018 primarily driven by the net gain on sale of businesses in 2018 partially offset by the impact of the merger, including purchase accounting impacts, in the current year. On an adjusted pro forma basis, operating profit increased $476 million, or 10%, for 2019 versus 2018, as the impacts of higher pricing and volumes were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and cost inflation.*\n\u2022\nIncome from continuing operations of $2,183 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.00 decreased from $4,273 million and $12.79, respectively in 2018. Adjusted pro forma income from continuing operations of $4,003 million and adjusted pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.34 were 17% and 19%, respectively above 2018 adjusted pro forma amounts.*\n\u2022\nCash flow from operations was $6,119 million, or 22% of sales. Capital expenditures were $3,682 million; dividends paid were $1,891 million; net purchases of ordinary shares of $2,586 million; and debt repayments, net were $1,260 million.\n* A reconciliation of the adjusted pro forma amounts can be found in the \"Supplemental Pro Forma Income Statement Information\" and \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section in this MD&A. See Notes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 13 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\n2020 Outlook\nThe company\u2019s business is to build, own, and operate industrial gas plants in order to supply atmospheric and process gases to customers. As such, Linde believes that its sale of gas project backlog is one indicator of future sales growth. At December 31, 2019, Linde\u2019s sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was $4.4 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction. APAC and Americas represent 64 percent and 29 percent of the backlog, respectively, with the remaining backlog in EMEA. These plants will primarily supply customers in the energy, chemical, and electronics end-markets.\nThe above outlook should be read in conjunction with the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences. These materials are available on the company\u2019s website, www.linde.com, but are not incorporated herein.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND OTHER INFORMATION\nThe following table provides summary information for 2019, 2018 and 2017.

On a pro forma basis sales increased $79 million in 2019 compared to 2018.\nOn a reported basis, sales increased 90% to $28,228 million in 2019 compared to $14,836 million in 2018 primarily due to the merger, net of related divestitures. Volume increased sales by 1% driven by higher volumes largely in the APAC segment, including new project start-ups. Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 3% to sales. Currency translation decreased sales by 2% driven by the weakening of the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and Chinese yuan against the US dollar. Lower cost pass-through, primarily natural gas, decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit.\nOn a pro forma basis, sales were relatively flat with prior year. Volume growth of 2% was largely driven by higher volumes in the Americas and APAC segments, including new project start-ups. Higher pricing across the gases segments contributed 2% to sales. Unfavorable currency translation, primarily driven by the weakening of the Euro, British pound, Chinese yuan and Australian dollar, decreased sales by 4%. Lower cost pass-through, primarily natural gas, decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. Acquisitions, largely in the Americas segment, contributed 1% to sales.\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nReported cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased $7,624 million, or 85%, for the year primarily due to the merger, net of related divestitures.\nOn a pro forma basis, cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization decreased $345 million or 2% in 2019 as compared to 2018. Pro forma cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 58.9% of sales in the year versus 60.3% of sales for 2018. The decrease as a percentage of sales in the year was due primarily to higher pricing.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nReported selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased $1,828 million, or 112%, in 2019 to $3,457 million primarily due to the merger. On a pro forma basis, SG&A decreased $179 million, or 5%, versus the 2018 period.\nOn a reported basis, SG&A increased 112% in 2019, primarily due to the merger. SG&A was 12.2% of sales in 2019 versus 11.0% in 2018, primarily due to the merger.\nOn a pro forma basis, SG&A decreased 5% in 2019 versus 2018. SG&A was 12.3% of sales in 2019 versus 12.9% in 2018. Currency impacts decreased SG&A by approximately $145 million in the 2019 period. Excluding currency impacts, underlying SG&A decreased due to cost reduction actions and productivity improvements which also drove the improvement of SG&A as a percentage of sales in the period.\nDepreciation and amortization\nReported depreciation and amortization expense increased $2,845 million, or 155%, versus 2018. The increase is primarily due to the merger, including $1,940 million of purchase accounting impacts related to the depreciation and amortization of the fair value adjustments of fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in the merger.\nOn a pro forma basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $249 million, or 5%, versus 2018. Currency movements decreased depreciation and amortization by approximately $197 million for the year. Excluding currency effects, depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately $52 million, primarily driven by measurement period adjustments recognized in 2019 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by increases due to large project start-ups.\nCost reduction programs and other charges\nLinde recorded cost reduction programs and other charges of $567 million and $309 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to merger and synergy-related costs and an asset impairment in the third quarter 2019 of approximately $73 million related to a joint venture in APAC resulting from an unfavorable arbitration ruling (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).\nOn an adjusted pro forma basis, these costs have been eliminated in both periods.\nOperating profit\nReported operating profit decreased $2,314 million in 2019, or 44%, primarily driven by the net gain on sale of businesses in 2018 partially offset by the impact of the merger, including purchase accounting impacts, in the current year. On an adjusted pro forma basis, operating profit increased $476 million, or 10%, for 2019 versus 2018.\nOn a reported basis, operating profit decreased $2,314 million, or 44%. 2019 includes Linde AG's operating results for the full year and a gain on merger-related divestitures of $164 million, which was offset by $1,952 million which primarily related to $1,940 million of purchase accounting charges for additional depreciation and amortization, and $567 million in cost reduction program and other charges. 2018 included Linde AG's operating results from October 31, 2018 forward and a gain on merger-related divestitures of $3,294 million, partially offset by purchase accounting impacts of $714 million and $309 million of merger-related charges.\nOn an adjusted pro forma basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting, cost reduction programs and other charges and net gains from merger-related divestitures, operating profit increased $476 million, or 10%, as the impacts of higher pricing and volumes were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and cost inflation. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\nInterest expense - net\nReported interest expense - net in 2019 decreased $164 million, or 81%, versus 2018. On an adjusted pro forma basis interest expense decreased $145 million, or 52% in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nOn a reported basis, interest expense - net decreased $164 million in 2019 and included a decrease of $96 million related to purchase accounting impacts on the fair value of debt acquired in the merger. Excluding this purchase accounting impact, reported interest expense decreased $68 million in the year as interest on debt acquired in the merger was more than offset by higher interest income.\nOn an adjusted pro forma basis, interest expense - net decreased $145 million in 2019 primarily due to lower debt levels and higher interest income.\nNet pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost was a benefit of $32 million in 2019 versus a benefit of $4 million in 2018 and included pension settlement charges of $97 million and a net $8 million curtailment charge (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of these charges, the net pension and OPEB benefit, excluding service cost increased $133 million in 2019, primarily due to the impact of pension and OPEB plans acquired in the merger.\nOn an adjusted pro forma basis, net pension and OPEB (benefit), excluding service cost was a benefit of $129 million in 2019 versus a benefit of $165 million in 2018.\nEffective tax rate\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2019 was 26.3% versus 16.2% in 2018. 2018 included the impact of the sale of Praxair's European industrial gas business (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).\nOn an adjusted pro forma basis, the ETR for 2019 was 24.0% versus 25.8% in 2018.\nIncome from equity investments\nReported income from equity investments for 2019 increased $58 million to $114 million largely related to investments in APAC and EMEA. This increase is primarily related to the merger.\nOn an adjusted pro forma basis, income from equity investments for 2019 increased $55 million to $171 million. The increase is primarily related to increased earnings from equity investments.\nNoncontrolling interests from continuing operations\nAt December 31, 2019, noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders\u2019 investments in APAC (primarily in China) and surface technologies.\nReported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $74 million to $89 million in 2019 from $15 million in 2018, primarily driven by the merger. 2019 noncontrolling interests includes a $33 million impact for an asset impairment charge in the third quarter related to a joint venture in APAC (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).\nOn an adjusted pro forma basis, noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $10 million in 2019 driven by higher income from continuing operations.\nIncome from continuing operations\nReported income from continuing operations decreased $2,090 million, or 49%, primarily due to the 2018 gain on merger-related divestitures, partially offset by the merger. Other impacts related to interest - net; net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost; income taxes; income from equity investments; and noncontrolling interest largely offset in the aggregate.\nOn an adjusted pro forma basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and other non-GAAP adjustments, income from continuing operations increased $570 million, or 17%, in 2019 primarily due to higher adjusted pro forma operating profit, lower adjusted pro forma interest expense-net, lower adjusted ETR, and higher adjusted pro forma income from equity investments.\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations\nReported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $8.79, or 69%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower net income from continuing operations and higher diluted shares outstanding as a result of the merger.\nOn an adjusted pro forma basis, diluted EPS of $7.34 in 2019 increased 19% versus 2018, primarily due to higher adjusted pro forma income from continuing operations and lower diluted shares outstanding.\nEmployees\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2019 was 79,886, a decrease of 934 employees from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by cost reduction actions partially offset by acquisitions.\nOther Financial Data\nEBITDA increased to $7,722 million in 2019 from $7,133 million in 2018, primarily due to the merger.\nAdjusted pro forma EBITDA from continuing operations increased to $8,178 million for 2019 as compared to $7,603 million in 2018 primarily due to higher income from continuing operations versus the prior year period.\nSee the \"Supplemental Pro Forma Income Statement Information\" for pro forma amounts and \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" for adjusted pro forma amounts sections below for definitions and reconciliations of these pro forma and adjusted pro forma non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $435 million resulted primarily from a decrease in the funded status of the company's largest retirement programs. Driven by the low discount rate environment,\nthe other comprehensive loss of $544 million related to the remeasurement of such retirement programs was partially offset by benefits from cumulative translation adjustments. The translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, the Chinese yuan and the British pound. See the \"Currency\" section of the MD&A for exchange rates used for translation purposes and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income by segment.\n2018 Compared With 2017\nSales increased 31% to $14,836 million in 2018 compared to $11,358 million in 2017 primarily reflecting the merger with Linde AG which contributed 25% to sales, net of divestitures. Underlying sales increased 6% driven by higher volumes and pricing. Volume growth of 4% was driven by higher volumes in North America and Asia, including new project start-ups. Higher overall pricing across all geographic segments contributed 2% to sales. Currency translation impact decreased sales by 1%. Higher cost pass-through, primarily natural gas, increased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. The divestiture of Praxair's European businesses in December of 2018 decreased sales by 1%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $422 million, or 35%, in 2018 to $1,629 million primarily due to the merger. SG&A was 11.0% of sales in 2018 versus 10.6% in 2017, primarily due to the merger.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $646 million, or 55%, versus 2017. The increase is primarily due to the merger, including $346 million of purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value of fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in the merger.\nCost reduction programs and other charges were $309 million and $52 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively and are primarily related to the merger. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\nNet gain on the sale of businesses was $3,294 million and related primarily to the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business in connection with the merger. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther income (expenses) - net in 2018 was a $18 million benefit versus a $4 million benefit in 2017 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of major components). In North America, 2018 included a $30 million asset impairment charge which was more than offset by $43 million of gains on asset disposals. In Asia, 2018 included a $22 million asset impairment charge, offset by a litigation settlement gain.\nReported operating profit of $5,247 million in 2018 was $2,803 million, or 115% higher than reported operating profit of $2,444 million in 2017. 2018 includes a net gain on sale of businesses of $3,294 million, partially offset by transaction costs and other charges of $309 million, and purchase accounting impacts of $714 million related to the Linde AG merger (see Notes 4, 5 and 3, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements). 2017 included transaction costs of $52 million (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating profit of $2,976 million in 2018 was $480 million, or 19%, higher than adjusted operating profit of $2,496 million in 2017 driven primarily by the merger. Higher volumes and price in the geographic segments and surface technologies also contributed to operating profit growth. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\nReported interest expense - net in 2018 increased $41 million, or 25%, versus 2017. 2018 included charges of $26 million relating to the early redemption of notes and a decrease of $21 million related to purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value of debt acquired in the merger (see Notes 13 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively). Excluding these impacts, adjusted interest expense of $197 million increased $36 million, or 22%, largely attributable to interest on the debt acquired in the merger and lower capitalized interest. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to interest expense.\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2018 was 16.2% versus 44.9% in 2017. The decrease in the ETR for the 2018 period versus the U.S. statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the impact of the sale of Praxair's European industrial gases business. The increase in the ETR for the 2017 period versus the U.S. statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the net $394 million charge related to the Tax Act. Excluding these and other smaller impacts as set forth in the \"Non-GAAP financial measures\" section of this MD&A, on an adjusted basis the ETR for the 2018 and 2017 periods was 23.8% and 27.2%, respectively. The decrease was driven primarily by the impact of the Tax Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 which lowered the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).\nEquity income increased $9 million in 2018 versus 2017 and included charges of $9 million for purchase accounting impacts related to the fair value step up of equity investments acquired in the merger. Excluding this impact, equity income increased $18 million, primarily driven by income from equity investments acquired in the merger.\nAt December 31, 2018, reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders\u2019 investments in Asia (primarily in China) and surface technologies. Reported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased $46 million to $15 million in 2018 from $61 million in 2017. 2018 includes the impact of the merger and related purchase accounting impacts. Excluding these impacts, adjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations of $73 million increased $12 million, or 20%, primarily due to noncontrolling interests acquired in the merger.\nReported income from continuing operations for 2018 was $4,273 million, $3,026 million, or 243%, higher than reported income from continuing operations of $1,247 million in 2017. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $2,121 million in 2018 was $431 million, or 26%, higher than adjusted income from continuing operations of $1,690 million in 2017 primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit and a lower effective tax rate.\nReported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (\"EPS\") of $12.79 in 2018 increased $8.47 per diluted share, or 196% from $4.32 in 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.35 in 2018 increased $.50 per diluted share, or 9%, from adjusted diluted EPS of $5.85 in 2017. The increase in adjusted diluted EPS was primarily due to the merger and higher adjusted income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in diluted shares resulting from equity acquired in the merger.\nOther comprehensive losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $299 million resulted primarily from (i) a $221 million unfavorable impact in the funded status of Linde's retirement obligations and (ii) adverse currency translation adjustments of $76 million, net of a benefit of $318 million related to the release of currency translation adjustments on Praxair's European business (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The decrease in the funded status of retirement obligations was primarily the result of higher current year actuarial losses, as the impact of higher U.S. discount rates was largely offset by a lower actual return on assets. Unfavorable translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar.\nUnfavorable currency translation adjustments included $343 million in South America and $149 million in Asia, partially offset by favorable currency translation adjustments of $231 million related to Linde AG (primarily Europe and Asia) representing translation impacts for the period from merger date through December 31, 2018. Remaining other comprehensive losses of $2 million relate to the amortization of deferred losses on the company's derivatives and unrealized losses on available for sale securities. Refer to the Currency section of the MD&A and Notes 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2018 was 80,820, an increase of 54,359 employees from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by an increase of approximately 56,000 related to the merger partially offset by a decrease of approximately 2,500 from the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business.\nOther Financial Data\nEarnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") increased $3,458 million to $7,133 million in 2018 from $3,675 million in 2017. EBITDA in 2018 includes a gain on sale of businesses and purchase accounting impacts, and both periods include transaction and other costs. Excluding the impacts of these items, adjusted EBITDA increased $789 million to $4,516 million in 2018 from $3,727 million in 2017 driven by the consolidation of Linde AG starting October 31, 2018, and higher adjusted income from continuing operations plus depreciation and amortization versus the prior year.\nSee the \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section for definitions and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to reported amounts.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe company\u2019s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates. The company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties.\nEnvironmental Matters\nLinde\u2019s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases, which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment. However, worldwide costs relating to environmental\nprotection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and Linde's ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards. In addition, Linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather.\nClimate Change\nLinde operates in jurisdictions that have, or are developing, laws and/or regulations to reduce or mitigate the perceived adverse effects of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has promulgated rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions, and Linde and many of its suppliers and customers are subject to these rules. EPA has also promulgated regulations to restrict GHG emissions, including final rules regulating GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities, many of which are Linde suppliers or customers. In addition to these developments in the United States, GHGs are regulated in the European Union under the Emissions Trading System, which has wide implications for the company's customers and may impact certain operations of Linde in Europe. There are also requirements for mandatory reporting in Canada, which apply to certain Linde operations and will be used in developing cap-and-trade regulations on GHG emissions. These regulations are expected to impact certain Linde facilities in Canada. Climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies are also being widely introduced in jurisdictions throughout Latin America and parts of Asia. China has announced plans to implement its national carbon emissions trading system in 2020, though it does not appear the regulations will have a direct impact on GHG emissions from Linde facilities. Among other impacts, such regulations are expected to raise the cost of energy, which is a significant cost for Linde. Nevertheless, Linde's long-term customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity, natural gas, and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change regulation.\nLinde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business, as hydrogen is essential to refineries that use it to remove sulfur from transportation fuels in order to meet ambient air quality standards in the United States and fuel standards in other regions. Hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.\nTo manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change.\nLinde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG footprint through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency, investment in renewable energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde maintains related performance improvement targets and reports progress against these targets regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors.\nAt the same time, Linde may benefit from business opportunities arising from governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions, including GHG emissions, in Linde's processes and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\nCosts Relating to the Protection of the Environment\nEnvironmental protection costs in 2019 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2019, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based\non historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\nLegal Proceedings\nSee Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\nRetirement Benefits\nPensions\nThe net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. and international pension plans was $107 million in 2019, $24 million in 2018 and $58 million in 2017. The net periodic pension cost for 2019 includes pension settlement charges of $97 million related to lump sum payments, which were triggered by either a change in control provision or merger-related divestitures and a net curtailment charge of $8 million for termination benefits, primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze. Settlement charges for 2018 and 2017 were $14 million and $2 million, respectively.\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $504 million as of December 31, 2019 and a deficit of $556 million at December 31, 2018. The funded status for international plans was a deficit of $1,801 million as of December 31, 2019 and a deficit of $1,241 million at December 31, 2018. In the U.S., the benefit from the actual return on assets more than offset the impacts of unfavorable liability experience, resulting from the low discount rate environment. For the international plans, the unfavorable impact of lower discount rates outweighed favorable plan asset experience.\nGlobal pension contributions were $94 million in 2019, $87 million in 2018 and $19 million in 2017. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2020 are currently expected to be in the range of $50 million to $80 million.\nLinde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2020 of 7.00% and 5.31% for the U.S. and international plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios.\nExcluding the impact of any settlements, 2020 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $45 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the amortization of deferred losses.\nRefer to the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company\u2019s retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost and funded status.\nInsurance\nLinde purchases insurance to limit a variety of property and casualty risks, including those related to property, business interruption, third-party liability and workers\u2019 compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States, $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. In addition, the company self retains risk up to $5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils effecting its properties along with a separate $5 million deductible on all business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. To mitigate its aggregate loss potential above these retentions, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies. The company does not currently operate or participate in any captive insurance companies or other non-traditional risk transfer alternatives.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had recorded a total of $66 million and $60 million, respectively, representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates. The estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. If actual claims differ from the company\u2019s estimates, they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted.\nLinde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies.\nSEGMENT DISCUSSION\nEffective October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG completed the previously announced merger, resulting in the formation of Linde plc (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the merger). As a result of the merger and effective with the lifting of the hold separate order effective on March 1, 2019, new operating segments were created which are used by the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") to allocate company resources and assess performance. Linde\u2019s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde\u2019s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represents three of the company's new reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation.\nThe industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde\u2019s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer\u2019s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.\nThe company\u2019s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes remains unchanged - Segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company\u2019s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources. For a description of Linde's previous operating segments, refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements of Linde's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below presents sales and operating profit information about reportable segments and Other for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the results of both Praxair and Linde AG for the entire year. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018 (the merger date), including the impacts of purchase accounting (See Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The historical periods prior to 2018 reflect the results of Praxair. Prior periods presented have been recast to be consistent with the new segment structure.:\nAmericas\nThe Americas segment includes Linde\u2019s industrial gases operations in approximately 20 countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.\nSales\nReported sales for the Americas segment for 2019 increased $2,976 million, or 37%, versus 2018, primarily due to the merger. On a pro forma basis, sales increased $450 million, or 4%, versus 2018.\nOn a reported basis, sales increased 37% in 2019 primarily due to the merger. Higher pricing contributed 3% to sales. Unfavorable currency translation decreased sales by 2%, primarily driven by the weakening of the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar against the U.S. Dollar. Lower cost past-through, primarily natural gas, decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit.\nOn a pro forma basis, volume growth contributed 1% to sales in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by base volume growth in the United States and Latin America and project start ups in the United States Gulf Coast. Higher pricing contributed 3% to sales. Currency translation decreased sales by 2%. Acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 3%, related primarily to acquisitions in North America. Lower cost pass-through decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit.\nReported sales for 2018 increased $813 million, or 11%, versus 2017 primarily due to the merger which contributed 7% to sales. Underlying sales growth was 4%, driven by higher volumes and higher price. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased sales by 2%. Higher cost pass-through increased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit.\nOperating Profit\nReported operating profit for the Americas segment for 2019 increased $525 million, or 26% from 2018, due primarily to the merger. On a pro forma basis, operating profit increased $144 million, or 6%, for 2019 as compared to 2018.\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased 26% in 2019 largely driven by the merger and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation impacts of 2%.\nPro forma operating profit in the Americas segment increased $144 million for 2019, or 6%, versus the 2018 period. Operating growth from higher volumes, higher price and acquisitions was partially offset by unfavorable currency translation impacts of 2% in the year. The 2018 year also included net gains on asset disposals of approximately $20 million.\nReported operating profit for 2018 increased $199 million, or 11%, driven primarily by the merger, higher volumes and higher price partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. The 2018 period also included net gains on asset disposals of $13 million.\nEMEA\nThe EMEA segment includes Linde's industrial gases operations in approximately 45 European, Middle Eastern and African countries including Germany, France, Sweden, the Republic of South Africa, and the United Kingdom.\nSales\nOn a reported basis, EMEA segment sales increased by $3,999 million, or 151%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to the merger, net of related divestitures. On a pro forma basis, sales decreased $348 million, or 5%, in 2019 versus 2018.\nOn a reported basis, sales increased 151% in 2019 driven primarily by the net impact of the merger with Linde AG and the related divestiture of Praxair's European gases business in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding this net impact, sales decreased 2%. Volumes decreased 1% driven by weaker industrial production. Higher price contributed 1% to sales. Unfavorable currency translation and cost pass-through each decreased sales by 1%.\nOn a pro forma basis, sales decreased 5% in 2019, primarily driven by unfavorable currency translation due to the weakening of the Euro, British pound and South African rand against the U.S. Dollar which decreased sales by 6% .

On a pro forma basis, operating profit increased $23 million, or 2%, in 2019 versus the respective 2018 period.\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased 184% in 2019, driven primarily by the net impact of the merger with Linde AG and the related divestiture of Praxair's European gases business in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nOn a pro forma basis, operating profit increased 2% in 2019 as compared to 2018 as higher pricing and the impact of cost reduction actions more than offset the impacts of unfavorable currency translation and cost inflation.\nReported operating profit increased $164 million, or 52%, in 2018 driven primarily by the merger, net of related divestitures. Favorable currency translation increased operating profit by 5%. Excluding the impact of the merger and related divestitures and currency, operating profit increased driven by higher price and higher volumes, partially offset by cost inflation.\nAPAC\nThe APAC segment includes Linde's industrial gases operations in approximately 20 Asian and South Pacific countries and regions including China, Australia, India, South Korea and Taiwan.\nSales\nOn a reported basis, APAC segment sales increased by $3,393 million, or 139%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to the merger. On a pro forma basis, sales decreased $171 million, or 3%, in 2019 versus 2018.\nOn a reported basis, sales increased 139% in 2019 driven by the merger. Unfavorable currency translation decreased sales by 3%, driven primarily by the weakening of the Chinese yuan, Korean won and Indian rupee against the U.S. Dollar.

Volume growth of 9% was primarily attributable to base volume growth in China, Korea and India and new project start-ups in China. Higher price increased sales by 2% driven by China.\nOperating Profit\nOn a reported basis, operating profit for the APAC segment increased by $733 million, or 158%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, due primarily to the merger. On a pro forma basis, operating profit increased $155 million, or 15%, in 2019 versus the respective 2018 period.\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased 158% in 2019, driven by the net impact of the merger with Linde AG. Unfavorable currency translation decreased operating profit by 3% for the year. Excluding the merger and currency impacts, operating profit growth was driven by higher price and cost reduction programs.\nOn a pro forma basis, operating profit increased 15% in 2019 as compared to 2018. Unfavorable currency translation decreased operating profit by 5% in the year. Excluding currency impacts, operating growth was driven by higher price and cost reduction programs.\nReported operating profit in 2018 increased $136 million, or 41%, versus 2017 driven primarily by the merger, higher volumes and price.

Currency translation decreased sales by 2% for the year.\nOn a pro forma basis, sales increased 8% for 2019. Volume and price growth increased sales by 12%, driven by helium and surface technologies. Currency translation decreased sales by 4%.\nReported sales for 2018 increased $207 million, or 19%, versus 2017 driven primarily by the merger. Excluding the impact of the merger, underlying sales increased driven by surface technologies volumes to the aerospace and manufacturing end-markets and higher price.\nOperating profit\nReported operating profit in Other decreased $208 million in 2019 versus the respective 2018 periods, due primarily to the merger. On a pro forma basis, operating loss improved $49 million, or 17%, when comparing 2019 to the 2018 period.\nOn a reported basis, operating profit decreased $208 million primarily related to the merger as operating profit increases from higher volumes and price were more than offset by the merger of Linde AG corporate.\nOn a pro forma basis, operating profit improved $49 million in the year. Higher volumes, helium pricing and cost reduction actions improved operating profit which was partially offset by higher helium sourcing costs.\nReported operating profit for 2018 decreased $33 million versus 2017 primarily related to the merger as operating profit increases from higher volumes and price were more than offset by the merger of Linde AG corporate.\nCurrency\nThe results of Linde\u2019s non-U.S. operations are translated to the company\u2019s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, from the functional currencies used in the countries in which the company operates. For most foreign operations, Linde uses the local currency as its functional currency. There is inherent variability and unpredictability in the relationship of these functional currencies to the U.S. dollar and such currency movements may materially impact Linde\u2019s results of operations in any given period.\nTo help understand the reported results, the following is a summary of the significant currencies underlying Linde\u2019s consolidated results and the exchange rates used to translate the financial statements (rates of exchange expressed in units of local currency per U.S. dollar):\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA\n____________________\n(a)\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n(b)\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCash decreased $1,766 million in 2019 versus 2018. The primary sources of cash in 2019 were cash flows from operations of $6,119 million and proceeds from divestitures and asset sales of $5,096 million. The primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of $3,682 million, transactions with noncontrolling interests of $3,260 million, net purchases of ordinary shares of $2,586 million, cash dividends to shareholders of $1,891 million and net debt repayments of $1,260 million. Noncontrolling interest transactions and other of $3,260 million included a payment of approximately $3.2 billion related to the cash-merger squeeze-out of the 8% of Linde AG shares completed on April 8, 2019 (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nCash Flows From Operations\n2019 compared with 2018\nCash flows from operations was $6,119 million, or 22% of sales, an increase of $2,465 million from $3,654 million, or 25% of sales in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the merger which drove higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges, partially offset by higher working capital requirements and higher merger and synergy related cash outflows. 2019 included merger and synergy related cash outflows of $803 million, of which $567 million is included within \"Net income (including noncontrolling interests)\" and $236 million is included within \"Cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments\".\n2018 compared with 2017\nCash flows from operations was $3,654 million, or 25% of sales, an increase of $613 million from $3,041 million, or 27% of sales in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the merger, higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges and favorable working capital requirements, partially offset by unfavorable changes in other long-term assets and liabilities and higher pension contributions.\nInvesting\n2019 compared with 2018\nNet cash provided by investing activities of $1,189 million decreased $4,174 million from 2018 primarily driven by lower proceeds from merger-related divestitures, cash acquired in the merger and higher capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures in 2019 were $3,682 million, an increase of $1,799 million from 2018, driven primarily by the merger. Capital expenditures during 2019 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 44% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 33% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\nAcquisition expenditures in 2019 were $225 million, an increase of $200 million from 2018 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas.\nDivestitures and asset sales in 2019 totaled $5,096 million primarily driven by proceeds from merger-related divestitures including $3.4 billion from the sale of Linde AG's Americas business, $1.2 billion from the sale of Linde Korea, and approximately $200 million each from the sale of the legacy Praxair and legacy Linde India selected assets (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). 2018 divestiture and asset sale cash flows included $5.6 billion from the sale of Praxair's European business and $214 million related to the sale of Praxair's Italian joint venture (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).\n2018 compared with 2017\nNet cash provided by investing activities of $5,363 million increased $6,677 million from 2017 primarily driven by proceeds from the divestiture of Praxair's European business and cash acquired in the merger, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures in 2018 were $1,883 million, an increase of $572 million from 2017, driven primarily by the merger with Linde AG. Capital expenditures during 2019 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth and density.\nAcquisition expenditures in 2018 were $25 million, a decrease of $8 million from 2017. Additionally, $1,363 million of cash was acquired in the merger (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).\nDivestitures and asset sales in 2018 totaled $5,908 million primarily driven by proceeds from merger-related divestitures including $5.6 billion from the sale of Praxair's European business and $214 million related to the sale of Praxair's Italian joint venture (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).\nFinancing\nLinde\u2019s financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde\u2019s international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\nCash used for financing activities was $8,997 million in 2019 compared to $4,998 million in 2018. The primary financing uses of cash were for transactions with noncontrolling interests, net debt repayments, cash dividends and net purchases of Linde ordinary shares. Noncontrolling interest transactions and other payments of $3,260 million increased $2,858 million from 2018 driven by a payment of approximately $3.2 billion for the cash-merger squeeze-out of the 8% of Linde AG shares completed on April 8, 2019 (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). Amounts paid in 2018 include $315 million for the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in Praxair's Italian joint venture in a merger-related transaction (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) and $25 million in interest related to the early redemption of bonds. Cash dividends of $1,891 million increased $725 million from 2018 driven primarily by higher shares outstanding after the merger and a 6% increase in dividends per share from $3.30 to $3.50. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $2,586 million in 2019 versus $522 million in 2018 driven by increased share repurchases. The cash used for debt repayments-net of $1,260 million decreased $1,648 million from $2,908 million during 2018 while cash decreased $1,766 million. Net debt (calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents) increased $426 million primarily due to lower cash balances partially offset by debt repayments.\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2019, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\nNote 13 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company\u2019s debt repayments in 2019, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 14 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde\u2019s major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2019 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\nLinde\u2019s total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 was $11,256 million, $426 million higher than $10,830 million at December 31, 2018. The December 31, 2019 net debt balance includes $12,752 million in public securities, $1,204 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $2,700 million of cash. Linde\u2019s global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2% for 2019.\nIn February 2019, Linde repaid $500 million of 1.90% rate notes that became due; in May 2019 Linde repaid $150 million of variable rate notes that became due; in June 2019 Linde repaid \u20ac500 million of 1.75% notes that due and AUD100 million of variable rate notes that became due; in August 2019 Linde repaid $200 million of variable rate notes that became due.\nOn March 26, 2019 the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement (\"the Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of banking institutions, which became effective on March 29, 2019. The Credit Agreement provides for total commitments of $5.0 billion, which may be increased up to $6.5 billion, subject to receipt of additional commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. There are no financial maintenance covenants contained within the Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility expires on March 26, 2024 with the option to request two one-year extensions of the expiration date. In connection with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, Praxair and Linde AG terminated their respective existing revolving credit facilities. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019.\nOn September 3, 2019, Linde and the company\u2019s subsidiaries Praxair and Linde AG entered into a series of parent and subsidiary guarantees related to currently outstanding notes issued by Praxair and Linde AG as well as the $5 billion Credit Agreement.\nOn December 10, 2018, the company announced a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was completed in February of 2019. On January 22, 2019, the company\u2019s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares, of which $2.3 billion had been repurchased through December 31, 2019. For additional information\nrelated to the share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table sets forth Linde\u2019s material contract obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nContractual interest on long-term debt of $1,538 million represents interest the company is contracted to pay on outstanding long-term debt, current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, calculated on a basis consistent with planned debt maturities, excluding the interest impact of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2019, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $10,799 million and floating-rate debt of $3,157 million. The rate assumed for floating-rate debt was the rate in effect at December 31, 2019.\nRetirement obligations of $430 million include estimates of pension plan contributions and expected future benefit payments for unfunded pension and OPEB plans. Pension plan contributions are forecasted for 2020 only. For purposes of the table, $60 million of estimated contributions have been included for 2020. Expected future unfunded pension and OPEB benefit payments are forecasted only through 2029. Contribution and unfunded benefit payment estimates are based upon current valuation assumptions. Estimates of pension contributions after 2020 and unfunded benefit payments after 2029 are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. Retirement obligations are more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nUnconditional purchase obligations of $6,507 million represent contractual commitments under various long and short-term take-or-pay arrangements with suppliers and are not included on Linde's balance sheet. These obligations are primarily minimum-purchase commitments for helium, electricity, natural gas and feedstock used to produce atmospheric and process gases. A significant portion of these obligations is passed on to customers through similar take-or-pay or other contractual arrangements. Purchase obligations that are not passed along to customers through such contractual arrangements are subject to market conditions, but do not represent a material risk to Linde. Approximately $2,983 million of the purchase obligations relates to power and is intended to secure the uninterrupted supply of electricity and feedstock to Linde's plants to reliably satisfy customer product supply obligations, and extend through 2030. Certain of the power contracts contain various cancellation provisions requiring supplier agreement, and many are subject to annual escalations based on local inflation factors.\nConstruction commitments of $3,421 million represent outstanding commitments to complete authorized construction projects as of December 31, 2019. A significant portion of Linde\u2019s capital spending is related to the construction of new production facilities to satisfy customer commitments which may take a year or more to complete.\nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $415 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table because the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated. Tax liabilities for deemed repatriation of earnings of $261 million are payable over the next six years. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures surrounding the \"Tax Act\" and uncertain income tax positions.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2019, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on Linde\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding Linde\u2019s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Their application places significant importance on management\u2019s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Linde\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made. These policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by Linde\u2019s Audit Committee.\nPurchase Accounting\nLinde AG\u2019s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the merger. Estimates of fair value represent management's best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties. In determining the fair value, Linde utilized various forms of the income, cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued. The estimation of fair value includes significant judgments related to future cash flows (sales, costs, customer attrition rates, and contributory asset charges), discount rates, competitive trends, market comparables and others. Inputs were generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets and liabilities, as well as asset lives, have a material impact to the company's consolidated financial statements, and are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. As of the end of 2019, the valuation process to determine the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities is complete.\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciable Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment\nLinde\u2019s net property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2019 was $29,064 million, representing 34% of the company\u2019s consolidated total assets. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3,940 million, or 16% of total operating costs. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation.\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets\u2019 estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors, including historical experience with similar assets, technological life cycles, geographic locations and contractual supply relationships with on-site customers. Circumstances and events relating to these assets, such as on-site contract modifications, are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments (see \u201cAsset Impairments\u201d) are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly. Linde\u2019s largest asset values relate to cryogenic air-separation production plants with depreciable lives of principally 15 years.\nBased upon the assets as of December 31, 2019, if depreciable lives of machinery and equipment, on average, were increased or decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would be decreased by approximately $471 million or increased by approximately $618 million, respectively.\nSee Notes 3, 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAmortization of Other Intangible Assets\nLinde\u2019s net other intangible assets at December 31, 2019 was $16,137 million, representing 19% of the company\u2019s consolidated total assets, including $1,870 million of indefinite-lived intangibles. Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $735 million, or 3% of total operating costs. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated amortizable lives that are used to calculate the annual amortization expense and accumulated amortization. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nBased upon the assets as of December 31, 2019, if amortization lives of other intangible assets, on average, were increased or decreased by one year, annual amortization expense would be decreased by approximately $33 million or increased by approximately $36 million, respectively.\nSee Notes 3, 9, and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nLong-Term Construction Contracts\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plants manufactured specifically for end customers. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. We assess performance as progress towards completion is achieved on specific projects, earnings will be impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.\nPension Benefits\nPension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company\u2019s plans. The company utilizes the services of independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations.\nSeveral key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements. Management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, and the expected rate of compensation increase. The actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors, including employee turnover, retirement age, and mortality. Linde management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable, reflect the company\u2019s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. The sensitivities to each of the key assumptions presented below exclude the impact of special items that occurred during the year (e.g., divestiture-related settlement charges, settlement charges resulting from change in control provisions, etc.).\nThe weighted-average expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets were 7.27% for U.S. plans and 5.15% for international plans for the year ended December 31, 2019 (7.62% and 5.13%, respectively at December 31, 2018). The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. A 0.50% change in these expected long-term rates of return, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde\u2019s pension expense by approximately $44 million.\nThe company has consistently used a market-related value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense. The market-related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company\u2019s annual pension expense. Instead, annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The consolidated market-related value of assets was $8,778 million, or $158 million lower than the fair value of assets of $8,936 million at December 31, 2019. These net deferred investment losses of $158 million will be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense. Future actual investment gains or losses will impact the market-related value of assets and, therefore, will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner.\nDiscount rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and pension costs and are determined annually by management. The company measures the service and interest cost components of pension and OPEB expense for significant U.S. and international plans using the spot rate approach. U.S. plans that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rates by using a cash flow matching model provided by the company's independent actuaries. The model includes a portfolio of corporate bonds graded Aa or better by at least half of the ratings agencies and matches the U.S. plans' projected cash flows to the calculated spot rates. Discount rates for the remaining international plans are based on market yields for high-quality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement\ndate. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities and benefit costs, and to the Retirement Benefits section of the Consolidated Results and Other Information section of this MD&A for a further discussion of 2019 benefit costs. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates, with all other variables held constant, would increase Linde\u2019s pension expense by approximately $29 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would result in a decrease of $25 million. A 0.50% reduction in discount rates would increase the PBO by approximately $976 million whereas a 0.50% increase in discount rates would have a favorable impact to the PBO of approximately $855 million.\nThe weighted-average expected rate of compensation increase was 3.25% for U.S. plans and 2.46% for international plans at December 31, 2019 (3.25% and 2.38%, respectively, at December 31, 2018). The estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices. A 0.50% change in the expected rate of compensation increase, with all other variables held constant, would change Linde\u2019s pension expense by approximately $8 million and would impact the PBO by approximately $65 million.\nAsset Impairments\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles Assets\nAt December 31, 2019, the company had goodwill of $27,019 million and $1,870 million of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived other intangibles relate to the Linde name.\nThe company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from April 30 to October 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company\u2019s planning process. The change in annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. The company has determined this change in the method of applying an accounting principle is preferable.\nThe impairment tests performed during the second and fourth quarters of 2019 indicated no impairment. At December 31, 2019, Linde\u2019s enterprise value was approximately $125 billion (outstanding shares multiplied by the year-end stock price plus net debt, and without any control premium) while its total capital was approximately $63 billion.\nThe impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. In estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, management applied a multiple of earnings from a peer group to the company\u2019s forecasted earnings for the year ending December 31, 2019. The peer group is comprised of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics.\nSuch analysis requires the use of certain market assumptions and discount factors, which are subjective in nature. As applicable, estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the company's control such as business and economic trends, government regulation, and technological changes. Management believes that the quantitative and qualitative factors used to perform its annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable. Although the 2019 assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, changes in circumstances or conditions affecting this analysis could have a significant impact on the fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company's results of operations. Reporting units with greater concentration of Linde AG assets fair valued during the recent merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods.\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets from Linde AG recently fair valued are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, and no impairments were indicated.\nSee Notes 3, 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived other intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. For purposes of this test, asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which\nthere are independent and identifiable cash flows. Based upon Linde's business model, for property, plant and equipment an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support on-site, merchant and packaged gas customers. Alternatively, the asset group may be a pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods.\nIncome Taxes\nAt December 31, 2019, Linde had deferred tax assets of $2,179 million (net of valuation allowances of $222 million), and deferred tax liabilities of $8,825 million. At December 31, 2019, uncertain tax positions totaled $472 million (see Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Income tax expense was $769 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or about 26.3% of pre-tax income (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes).\nIn the preparation of consolidated financial statements, Linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. Linde evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g. capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Linde\u2019s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company\u2019s tax positions. The company\u2019s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets. If new information becomes available, adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company\u2019s reported results of operations.\nContingencies\nThe company accrues liabilities for non-income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized or realizable. If new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company\u2019s reported results of operations.\nLinde is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements). Such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company\u2019s financial statements.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nLinde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSUPPLEMENTAL PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION\nTo assist with a discussion of the 2019 and 2018 results on a comparable basis, certain supplemental unaudited pro forma income statement information is provided on both a consolidated and segment basis (referred to as \"pro forma Income Statement Information\" or \"pro forma information\").\nThe pro forma information has been prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, assuming the merger and the merger-related divestitures had been consummated on January 1, 2018 and includes adjustments for (1) the preliminary purchase accounting impacts of the merger, including increased amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment and lower interest expense due to revaluing existing debt to fair value, (2) conversion to US GAAP from IFRS for Linde AG, (3) accounting policy alignment, (4) the elimination of the impact of transactions between Praxair and Linde AG, (5) the elimination of the effect of events that are directly attributable to the Merger Agreement and (6) the elimination of the effect of consummated and probable divestitures required as a condition of the approval for the merger. In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma Adjustments that are (i) directly attributable to the business combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity\u2019s consolidated results.\nThe pro forma information is based on management's assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes and does not purport to represent what the results of operations would actually have been if the merger and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the dates indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. Also, the pro forma information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the merger or any related restructuring costs. Events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g. inventory step-up costs, non-recurring income/charges) are excluded from the unaudited pro forma information.\nThe unaudited pro forma income statement has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what Linde's results of operation actually would have been had the merger been completed on January 1, 2018. In addition, the unaudited pro forma income statement does not purport to project the future operating results of the company.\nThe pro forma Income Statement Information are included in the following schedules:\n- Year ended December 31, 2019 pro forma Income Statement Information\n- Year ended December 31, 2018 pro forma Income Statement Information\nRefer to an earlier section in this MD&A titled \"Merger of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG\".\nYEAR TO DATE DECEMBER 31, 2019 PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION\n(Millions of dollars, except per share data)\n(UNAUDITED)\n2019 Pro forma adjustments\n(a)\nTo eliminate the results of Praxair's merger-related divestitures.\n(b)\nTo eliminate the impact of the inventory step-up recorded in purchase accounting for the merger. This item is nonrecurring in nature, directly attributable to the merger and occurred within one year of the transaction.\n(c)\nTo eliminate the transaction costs and other charges related to the merger. These transaction costs are nonrecurring, directly attributable to the merger, and incremental. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n(d)\nTo eliminate the gain on merger related divestitures.\n(e)\nTo eliminate pension settlement charges related to the merger.\n(f)\nTo eliminate the income tax impacts of Other adjustments.\nYEAR TO DATE DECEMBER 31, 2018 PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION\n(Millions of dollars, except per share data)\n(UNAUDITED)\n2018 Pro forma adjustments\n(a) To include Linde plc consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2018. Note that the results include the performance of Praxair's European industrial gases business through December 3, 2018 and the results of Linde AG from October 31, 2018 (merger date) through December 31, 2018. The adjustments reflect reclassifications to conform to Linde plc's reporting format.\n(b) To include Linde AG consolidated results for the period prior to the merger date at October 31, 2018. The adjustments reflect reclassifications to conform to Linde plc's reporting format and adjustments from IFRS to U.S. GAAP.\n(c) To eliminate the results of merger-related divestitures required by regulatory authorities to secure approval for the Merger. These divestitures include the majority of Praxair's European industrial gases business (completed December 3, 2018), a significant portion of Linde AG's America's industrial gases business (completed on March 1, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's South Korean industrial gases business (completed April 30, 2019), as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia.\n(d) To include purchase accounting adjustments for the period from January 1, 2018 to October 30, 2018 (prior to the Merger). This relates to (i) additional depreciation and amortization related to the increased value of of property, plant and equipment and increased basis of intangible assets, (ii) interest expense impacts related to the fair value of debt, (iii) the tax impacts related to the non-GAAP adjustments above, (iv) income from equity investments equity related to the fair value of equity investments, and (v) noncontrolling interests adjustments related to the fair value adjustments above. Purchase accounting impacts are not included in the definition of segment operating profit; therefore, no pro forma adjustment is required for segment reporting.\n(e) To eliminate sales between Praxair and Linde AG for the period prior to the Merger date at October 31, 2018 (January 1, 2018 to October 30, 2018). (e) also includes a $368 million impact for the fair value step-up of inventories acquired in the merger. This charge is recorded in cost of sales and subsequently eliminated.\n(f) To eliminate the transaction costs and other charges related to the Merger.\n(g) To reflect the income tax impact of the above pro forma adjustments.\n(h) To reflect the impact on diluted shares outstanding and diluted EPS related to ordinary shares issues to Linde AG shareholders in connection with the Merger.\n(i) To eliminate other (income) charges not included in segment operating profit, primarily related to a gain on a sale of business in EMEA and a gain on a sale of asset in APAC.\n(j) To eliminate the gain on merger related divestitures.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe following non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement investors\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the company\u2019s financial leverage and operating performance. Special items which the company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business performance are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures.\nThe non-GAAP measures in the following reconciliations are presented in the Selected Financial Data (Item 6) or this MD&A.\nAdjusted Amounts\nCertain amounts for 2019, 2018, and 2017 have been included for reference purposes and to facilitate the calculations contained herein.\n(a) See pro forma Income Statement Information in the preceding sections.\n(b) The income tax expense (benefit) on the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using the applicable tax rates for the jurisdictions that were utilized in calculating the GAAP income tax expense (benefit) and included both current and deferred income tax amounts.\n(c) Net of income taxes which are shown separately in \u201cAdjusted Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate\u201d.\n(d) The company believes that its non-GAAP measures excluding Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG are useful to investors because: (i) the business combination was a merger of equals in an all-stock merger transaction, with no cash consideration, (ii) the company is managed on a geographic basis and the results of certain geographies are more heavily impacted by purchase accounting than others, causing results that are not comparable at the reportable segment level, therefore, the impacts of purchasing accounting adjustments to each segment vary and are not comparable within the company and when compared to other companies in similar regions, (iii) business management is evaluated and variable compensation is determined based on results excluding purchase accounting impacts, and; (iv) it is important to investors and analysts to understand the purchase accounting impacts to the financial statements.\nA summary of each of the adjustments made for Purchase accounting impacts - Linde AG are as follows:\nAdjusted Operating Profit and Margin: The purchase accounting adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2019 include (i) a $12 million adjustment for the increase in cost of sales related to the fair value step up of inventories acquired in the merger (included as a pro forma adjustment), and (ii) $1,940 in depreciation and amortization related to the fair value step up of fixed assets and intangible assets (primarily customer related) acquired in the merger.\nAdjusted Interest Expense - Net: Relates to the amortization of the fair value of debt acquired in the merger.\nAdjusted Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate: Relates to the current and deferred income tax impact on the adjustments discussed above. The income tax expense (benefit) on the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using the applicable tax rates for the jurisdictions that were utilized in calculating the GAAP income tax expense (benefit) and included both current and deferred income tax amounts.\nAdjusted Income from Equity Investments: Represents the amortization of increased fair value on equity investments related to depreciable and amortizable assets.\nAdjusted Noncontrolling Interests from Continuing Operations: Represents the noncontrolling interests\u2019 ownership portion of the adjustments described above determined on an entity by entity basis.\nNet Debt and Adjusted Net Debt\nNet debt is a financial liquidity measure used by investors, financial analysts and management to evaluate the ability of a company to repay its debt. Purchase accounting impacts have been excluded as they are non-cash and do not have an impact on liquidity.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nLinde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company\u2019s earnings, cash flows and equity.\nTo manage these risks, Linde uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest-rate swaps, treasury rate locks, currency swaps, forward contracts, and commodity contracts. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. Also, see Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of Linde\u2019s accounting policies and use of such instruments.\nThe following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of Linde\u2019s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at December 31, 2019. The range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects Linde\u2019s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2019, Linde had debt totaling $13,956 million ($15,296 million at December 31, 2018). For fixed-rate instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating-rate instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming that other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2019, including the impact of derivatives, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $10,799 million and floating-rate debt of $3,157 million, representing 77% and 23%, respectively, of total debt. At December 31, 2018, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $12,565 million and floating-rate debt of $2,731 million, representing 82% and 18%, respectively, of total debt.\nFixed Rate Debt\nIn order to mitigate interest rate risk, when considered appropriate interest-rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument. At December 31, 2019, Linde had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps outstanding that were designated as hedging instruments of the underlying debt issuances - refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. This sensitivity analysis assumes that, holding all other variables constant (such as foreign exchange rates, swaps and debt levels), a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed-rate debt portfolio by approximately $473 million ($594 million in 2018). A one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $73 million increase to derivative assets recorded.\nVariable Rate Debt\nAt December 31, 2019, the after-tax earnings and cash flows impact of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates, including offsetting impact of derivatives, on the variable-rate debt portfolio would be approximately $48 million ($24 million in 2018).\nForeign Currency Risk\nLinde\u2019s exchange-rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in Latin America (primarily Brazil, Chile and Colombia), Europe (primarily Germany, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom), Canada, Mexico, Asia Pacific (primarily Australia, China) and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources. Linde frequently utilizes currency contracts to hedge these exposures. At December 31, 2019, Linde had a notional amount outstanding of $9,713 million ($9,412 million at December 31, 2018) related to foreign exchange contracts. The majority of these were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures, primarily intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nHolding all other variables constant, if there were a 10% increase in foreign-currency exchange rates for the portfolio, the fair market value of foreign-currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019 would increase by approximately $194 million and at December 31, 2018 would decrease by approximately $307 million, which would be largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the foreign-currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged.",

Quarterly Data (Unaudited)\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLinde\u2019s consolidated financial statements are prepared by management, which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied on a consistent basis, except for accounting changes as disclosed, and include amounts that are estimates and judgments. All historical financial information in this annual report is consistent with the accompanying financial statements.\nLinde maintains accounting systems, including internal accounting controls, monitored by a staff of internal auditors, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial records and the protection of assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on recognition that the cost of a system should not exceed the related benefits. The effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for coordinating the management of corporate resources, and the leadership and commitment of top management. In compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Linde assessed its internal control over financial reporting and issued a report (see below).\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial statements. The Audit Committee periodically meets with management, internal auditors and the independent accountants to review and evaluate their accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities, including management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the committee, with and without management present.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nLinde\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (often referred to as COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.\nLinde\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 did not include the internal control over financial reporting related to Linde AG which was acquired by Praxair in a merger accounted for as a business combination. In connection with its antitrust review of the transaction, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) imposed a Hold Separate Order (the \u201cHSO\u201d) on Linde that was lifted on March 1, 2019 after all required asset divestitures in the U.S. were completed. The HSO required the companies to continue to operate globally as separate and independent companies apart from each other in all material respects. As such, the HSO regulatory restrictions prohibited Linde from being able to perform procedures necessary to complete an overall assessment of Linde AG\u2019s disparate internal control environment with operations in over 100 countries. Because of this, the assessment of Linde AG\u2019s internal control environment could only begin after the HSO was terminated on March 1, 2019, and as such Linde AG has been excluded from the overall Linde internal control assessment as of December 31, 2019.\nTotal assets and sales for Linde AG represent approximately 23% and 62%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued their opinion on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 as stated in their report.\n/s/ STEPHEN F. ANGEL\n/s/ KELCEY E. HOYT\nStephen F. Angel\nChief Executive Officer\nKelcey E. Hoyt\nChief Accounting Officer\n/s/ MATTHEW J. WHITE\nMatthew J. White\nChief Financial Officer\nMarch 2, 2020\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Linde plc\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Linde plc and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Linde Aktiengesellschaft (\"Linde AG\") from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 because it was acquired in a merger accounted for as a business combination during 2018 and subject to a hold separate order issued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission until March 2019. We have also excluded Linde AG from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Linde AG is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total sales excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 23% and 62%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition - Estimated Costs at Completion\nAs described in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, $2,799 million of the Company\u2019s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 was generated from the sale of equipment contracts. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimated costs at completion is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the estimated costs at completion and management\u2019s significant assumptions, including the estimated expected material and labor costs. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the estimated costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions, including the estimated expected material and labor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions involved evaluating management\u2019s ability to reasonably estimate costs at completion for the sale of equipment contracts on a sample basis by (i) performing a comparison of the originally estimated and actual costs incurred on similar completed equipment contracts, and (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to estimated costs at completion, including actual costs in excess of estimates. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating management\u2019s estimates and assumptions relating to the expected material and labor costs.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nAs described in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s consolidated goodwill balance was $27,019 million as of December 31, 2019. Management performs an impairment test annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. The impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\nvalue then management will estimate and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. In estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, management applied a multiple of earnings from a peer group to the Company\u2019s forecasted earnings for the year ending December 31, 2019. The peer group is comprised of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management\u2019s significant assumptions for the multiples of earnings from a peer group of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company\u2019s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, i) testing management\u2019s process for developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units, ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multiples of earnings model, (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions for the multiples of earnings from a peer group of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to the multiples of earnings involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the consistency with external market and industry data and (ii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company\u2019s multiples of earnings model and significant assumptions for the multiples of earnings from a peer group of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nStamford, Connecticut\nMarch 2, 2020\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s or its predecessor\u2019s auditor since 1992.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nLINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nLINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Dollar amounts in millions)\nThe accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nLINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Dollar amounts in millions)\nThe accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nLINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Millions of dollars)\nThe accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\nLINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data, shares in thousands)\nThe accompanying Notes are an integral part of these financial statements\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTE 1. FORMATION OF LINDE PLC AND BUSINESS COMBINATION OF PRAXAIR, INC. AND LINDE AG\nFormation of Linde plc\nLinde plc (\"Linde\" or \u201cthe company\u201d), a public limited company incorporated in Ireland, was formed in accordance with the requirements of the business combination agreement, dated as of June 1, 2017, as amended (the \u201cbusiness combination agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the business combination agreement, among other things, Praxair, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cPraxair\u201d), and Linde Aktiengesellschaft, a stock corporation incorporated under the laws of Germany (\u201cLinde AG\u201d), agreed to combine their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction, and become subsidiaries of the company (collectively referred to as \u201cbusiness combination\u201d or \u201cmerger\u201d). On October 31, 2018, Linde completed the business combination. Prior to the business combination, the company did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the business combination agreement.\nBusiness Combination of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG\nThe business combination has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d, with Praxair representing the accounting acquirer. Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, as of October 31, 2018, the company became the successor issuer to Praxair. Also, the Linde shares are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the company is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Linde shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cLIN\u201d. Prior to the business combination, the Praxair shares were registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE. In connection with the completion of the business combination, the Praxair shares were suspended from trading on the NYSE as of close of business (New York Time) on October 30, 2018. On November 1, 2018, Praxair filed a Form 25 to de-list and de-register its three series of Euro-denominated notes, including its 1.50%Notes due 2020, 1.20% Notes due 2024 and 1.625% Notes due 2025, that were listed on the NYSE. Trading of the Euro-denominated notes on the NYSE was suspended as of close of business (New York Time) on November 9, 2018, and Praxair filed a Form 15 with the SEC terminating the registration under the Exchange Act of its securities and suspending Praxair\u2019s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\nIn connection with the business combination, the company, Praxair and Linde AG entered into various agreements with regulatory authorities to satisfy anti-trust requirements to secure approval to consummate the business combination. These agreements included the sale of the majority of Praxair\u2019s European businesses (completed on December 3, 2018), the majority of Linde AG\u2019s Americas business (completed on March 1, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's South Korean industrial gases business (completed April 30, 2019), select assets of Praxair's Indian industrial gases business (completed July 12, 2019), select assets of Linde AG's Indian industrial gases business (completed December 16, 2019) as well as certain divestitures of other Praxair and Linde AG businesses in Asia that are currently expected to be sold in 2020 (collectively, the \u201cmerger-related divestitures\u201d). See Note 4 for additional information relating to merger-related divestitures.\nAdditionally, to obtain merger approval in the United States Linde, Praxair and Linde AG entered into an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") dated October 1, 2018 (\u201chold separate order\u201d or \u201cHSO\u201d). Under the HSO, the company, Praxair and Linde AG agreed to continue to operate Linde AG and Praxair as independent, ongoing, economically viable, competitive businesses held separate, distinct, and apart from each other\u2019s operations; and not coordinate any aspect of their operations until certain divestitures in the United States were completed. Accordingly, Linde had accounted for Linde AG as a separate segment for 2018 reporting purposes effective with the merger date. Prior to the merger date, the company\u2019s Linde AG segment did not exist. Since the FTC hold separate order restrictions were lifted effective March 1, 2019, the company subsequently implemented a new segment structure as follows: Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), APAC (Asia/South Pacific) and Engineering. This new management organization structure was implemented during the first quarter 2019 and, accordingly, segment information has been retrospectively recast for all prior periods. Refer to Note 20 Segment Information for further details.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\" U.S. GAAP\") and include the accounts of all significant subsidiaries where control exists and, in limited situations, variable-interest entities where the company is the primary\nbeneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation and any significant related-party transactions have been disclosed.\nEquity investments generally consist of 20% to 50% owned operations where the company exercises significant influence, but does not have control. Equity income from equity investments in corporations is reported on an after-tax basis. Pre-tax income from equity investments that are partnerships or limited-liability corporations (\"LLC\") is included in other income (expenses) - net with related taxes included in Income taxes. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances reflect that an impairment loss may have incurred.\nChanges in ownership interest that result either in consolidation or deconsolidation of an investment are recorded at fair value through earnings, including the retained ownership interest, while changes that do not result in either consolidation or deconsolidation of a subsidiary are treated as equity transactions.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ, management believes such estimates to be reasonable.\nOperations - Linde is the largest industrial gases company globally. The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric, process and specialty gases, and high-performance surface coatings to a diverse group of industries including aerospace, chemicals, food and beverage, electronics, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and metals. Linde\u2019s Engineering business offers its customers an extensive range of gas production and processing services including suppling plant components and services directly to customers.\nRevenue Recognition - Effective January 1, 2018, Linde adopted the FASB's Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (\"ASC 606\") relating to Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. See Note 21 for additional details regarding Linde's revenue recognition policies. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in no differences in revenue recognition compared to previous policies.\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average-cost method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment - Net - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The company capitalizes interest as part of the cost of constructing major facilities (see Note 10). Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 years to 40 years (see Note 10). Linde uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate. Maintenance of property, plant and equipment is generally expensed as incurred.\nThe company performs a test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should projected undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows.\nAsset-Retirement Obligations - An asset-retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to determine the fair value of the liability with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment which is then depreciated over its useful life. The liability is initially measured at discounted fair value and then accretion expense is recorded in each subsequent period. The company\u2019s asset-retirement obligations are primarily associated with its on-site long-term supply arrangements where the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The company's asset-retirement obligations are not material to its consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Currency Translation - For most foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency and translation gains and losses are reported as part of the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of equity as a cumulative translation adjustment (see Note 9).\nFinancial Instruments - Linde enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity pricing and energy costs. Such instruments primarily include interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements; currency-swap agreements; forward contracts; currency options; and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.\nThere are three types of derivatives the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.\nWhen a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes unless they are related to forecasted transactions. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair-value hedges are recognized in earnings as an offset to the change in the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Provided the hedge remains highly effective, any ineffectiveness is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets to offset translation gains and losses associated with the hedged net investment. Derivatives that are entered into for risk-management purposes and are not designated as hedges (primarily related to anticipated net income and currency derivatives other than for firm commitments) are recorded at their fair market values and recognized in current earnings.\nSee Note 14 for additional information relating to financial instruments.\nGoodwill - Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method which requires allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. Allocations of the purchase price are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions at the date of acquisition and are subject to revision based on final information received, including appraisals and other analyses which support underlying estimates.\nThe company performs a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from April 30 to October 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company\u2019s planning process.\nThe impairment test allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level. In estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, management applied a multiple of earnings from a peer group to the company\u2019s forecasted earnings for the year ending December 31, 2019. The peer group is comprised of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics.\nSee Notes 3 and 11 for additional information relating to goodwill.\nOther Intangible Assets - Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and brands/tradenames, are amortized over the estimated period of benefit. The determination of the estimated period of benefit will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset. Linde evaluates the recoverability of its intangible assets subject to amortization when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques. Indefinite lived intangible assets related to the Linde brand are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment loss may have occurred.\nSee Notes 3 and 12 for additional information relating to other intangible assets.\nAssets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations - Assets held for sale, as well as liabilities directly related to these assets, are classified separately in the consolidated balance sheets as held for sale if the requirements of the FASB\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, are satisfied. The main requirements of\nASC 360 are: (i) management having the authority to approve the action has committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, (ii) the assets are available for sale in their present condition at a reasonable market price, and (iii) a sale within the next twelve months is probable. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Amortization and depreciation has been discontinued. The process involved in determining the fair value less costs to sell involves estimates and assumptions that are subject to uncertainty.\nDiscontinued operations are reported as soon as a business is classified as held for sale, or has already been disposed of, and when the business to be disposed of represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the company\u2019s operations and financial results. Businesses acquired with the intent of divesting are also required to be reported as discontinued operations. The profit/loss from discontinued operations is reported separately from the expenses and income from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash flows from discontinued operations are shown separately from the cash flows from continuing operations. The information provided in the Notes relates to continuing operations. If the information relates exclusively to discontinued operations, this is highlighted accordingly.\nSee Note 4 for additional information relating to assets held for sale and discontinued operations.\nIncome Taxes - Deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets whenever circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods.\nUnder the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, the company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.\nSee Note 7 for additional information relating to income taxes, including the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.\nRetirement Benefits - Most Linde employees participate in a form of defined benefit or contribution retirement plan, and additionally certain employees are eligible to participate in various post-employment health care and life insurance benefit plans. The cost of contribution plans is recognized in the year earned while the cost of other plans is recognized over the employees\u2019 expected service period to the company, all in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. The funded status of the plans is recorded as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Funding of retirement benefits varies and is in accordance with local laws and practices.\nSee Note 18 for additional information relating to retirement programs.\nShare-based Compensation- The company has historically granted share-based awards which consist of stock options, restricted stock and performance-based stock. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated vesting period. For stock awards granted to full-retirement-eligible employees, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved. For performance-based awards, compensation expense is recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.\nSee Note 17 for additional disclosures relating to share-based compensation.\nReclassifications - Certain prior years\u2019 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year\u2019s presentation.\nSegment Presentation Change - As a result of the merger and effective with the lifting of the hold separate order in March 2019, new reportable segments were implemented. The new segments are: Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), APAC (Asia/South Pacific); and Engineering. All periods presented were recast to conform to the new segment structure. See Note 20.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Implemented in 2019\n\u2022\nLeases - In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on the accounting and financial statement presentation of leases. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases, except those that meet certain scope exceptions, and requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This guidance is effective beginning in 2019 and requires companies to transition using a modified retrospective approach. Linde has applied the practical expedient which allows prospective transition to the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019. The company elected the package of practical expedients relating to the reassessment of the lease portfolio pertaining to (i) whether expiring or existing contracts contain lease components, (ii) lease classification under ASC 842 and (iii) whether initial direct costs were capitalized under ASC 840. The company further implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption.\nThe standard had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated income statements. The most significant impact was the recognition of right of use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while the accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged. The company recognized both right of use assets and lease liabilities of $1.2 billion upon adoption. The adoption of the new lease accounting standard had no impact on retained earnings (See Note 6).\n\u2022\nDerivatives and Hedging - In August 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on accounting for hedging activities. The new guidance simplifies hedge effectiveness documentation requirements, changes both the designation and measurement for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. This guidance was effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of the standard had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards to be Implemented\n\u2022\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments - In June 2016, the FASB issued an update on the measurement of credit losses. The guidance introduces a new accounting model for expected credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables, based on estimates of current expected credit losses. This guidance will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter 2020 and requires companies to apply the change in accounting on a prospective basis. The company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on the consolidated financial statements and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact.\n\u2022\nSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment - In January 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance on the measurement of goodwill. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. The guidance will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter 2020 with early adoption permitted. The company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact.\n\u2022\nFair Value Measurement Disclosures - In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance that modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The guidance is effective in fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. Certain amendments must be applied prospectively while other amendments must be applied retrospectively. The company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022\nRetirement Benefit Disclosures - In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance is effective in fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted, and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3. BUSINESS COMBINATION\nMerger of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG\nAs described in Note 1, on October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction and became subsidiaries of the company.\nIn connection with the business combination, each share of common stock of Praxair par value $0.01 per share, (excluding any shares held in treasury immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which were automatically canceled and retired for no consideration) was converted into one ordinary share, par value \u20ac0.001 per share, of Linde plc. Additionally, each tendered share of common stock of Linde AG was converted into 1.54 ordinary shares of Linde plc.\nAs provided in the business combination agreement, at the effective time of the business combination outstanding Praxair stock options and other equity awards were generally converted into stock options and equity awards on a 1:1 basis with respect to Linde shares. Outstanding Linde AG share-based compensation awards were either settled in cash (for the portion vested), or were converted into similar stock options and equity awards with respect to Linde shares (for the portion unvested), after giving effect to the 1.54 exchange ratio. See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information.\nAllocation of Purchase Price\nIn accordance with the FASB\u2019s ASC 805, \"Business Combinations\", Praxair was determined to be the accounting acquirer. As such, the company has applied the acquisition method of accounting with respect to the identifiable assets and liabilities of Linde AG, which have been measured at fair value as of the date of the business combination.\nIn accordance with the business combination agreement, Linde AG shareholders that accepted the exchange offer received Linde shares in exchange for Linde AG shares at an exchange ratio of 1.54 Linde shares for each Linde AG share. Because Praxair is the accounting acquirer, the fair value of the equity issued by Linde plc to Linde AG shareholders in the exchange transaction was determined by reference to the market price of Praxair shares. Accordingly, the purchase consideration below reflects the estimated fair value of the 92% of Linde AG shares tendered and Linde shares issued in exchange for those Linde AG shares, which is based on the final closing price of Praxair shares prior to the effective time of the merger on October 31, 2018 of $164.50 per share.\nThe purchase price and fair value of Linde AG\u2019s net assets acquired as of the merger date on October 31, 2018 is presented as follows:\n(i)\nNumber of Linde AG shares tendered in the 2017 Exchange Offer.\n(ii)\nExchange ratio for Linde AG shares as set forth in the business combination agreement.\n(iii)\nClosing price of Praxair shares on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the effective time of the business combination on October 31, 2018.\nIn accordance with ASC 805, Linde AG's assets and liabilities were measured at fair value at October 31, 2018, primarily using Level 3 inputs except debt which was Level 1. Fair value represents management's best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties, including significant judgments related to future cash flows (sales, costs, customer attrition rates, and contributory asset charges), discount rates, competitive trends, market comparables, and others. Inputs used were generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Linde made measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the effective date of the Merger. The more significant measurement period adjustments made reflect: the agreed upon sale price of Linde AG\u2019s Korean business resulting in an increase to assets held for sale and corresponding decrease to goodwill of $344 million; an adjustment to the sale value of the Linde AG Americas businesses resulting in a decrease to assets held for sale and corresponding increase to goodwill of $211 million; refinement in the\nvaluation of other intangible assets resulting in an increase to intangible asset values and corresponding decrease to goodwill of $657 million; refinement in the valuation of property, plant and equipment resulting in a decrease to property, plant and equipment and corresponding increase to goodwill of $407 million; an increase to deferred income taxes with a corresponding increase to goodwill of $276 million; and an increase to the fair value of noncontrolling interest with a corresponding increase to goodwill of $222 million. The net impact of these and other less significant adjustments made during the twelve month period resulted in a net increase of $110 million to goodwill. The valuation process to determine the fair values is complete. The following table summarizes the final allocation of purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Linde, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Linde AG\u2019s net assets recorded as goodwill.\n(i)\nSee above for the calculation of the purchase price.\nSummary of Significant Fair Value Methods\nThe methods used to determine the fair value of significant identifiable assets and liabilities included in the allocation of purchase price are discussed below.\nInventories\nAcquired inventory is comprised of finished goods, work in process and raw materials. The fair value of finished goods was calculated as the estimated selling price, adjusted for costs of the selling effort and a reasonable profit allowance relating to the selling effort. The fair value of work in process inventory was primarily calculated as the estimated selling price, adjusted for estimated costs to complete the manufacturing, estimated costs of the selling effort, as well as a reasonable profit\nmargin on the remaining manufacturing and selling effort. The fair value of raw materials and supplies was determined based on replacement cost which approximates historical carrying value. The fair value step-up of inventories is being recognized in \u201cCost of sales\u201d as the inventory is sold.\nAssets held for sale and Liabilities of assets held for sale\nAs described in Note 1, as a condition of the European Commission (\"EC\"), the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), and other governmental regulatory authorities approval of the merger, Linde plc, Praxair and Linde AG were required to divest various businesses in Europe, the Americas and Asia. The fair value of these businesses has been determined based on the estimated net selling prices or sales agreements. See Note 4 for further information on merger-related divestitures.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe fair value of property, plant and equipment was primarily calculated using replacement costs adjusted for the age and condition of the asset, and is summarized below:\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nThe fair value of identifiable intangible assets is summarized below:\nThe fair value for all other identifiable intangible assets is based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e., its highest and best use).\nThe fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was valued using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, which incorporates the estimated future cash flows to be generated from Linde AG\u2019s existing customer base. Excess earnings are the earnings remaining after deducting the market rates of return on the estimated values of contributory assets, including debt-free net working capital, tangible assets, and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess earnings are thereby calculated for each year of multi-year projection periods and discounted to present value.\nOther intangibles primarily includes acquired technology. Linde brand, brands/tradenames and other intangibles were valued using the relief from royalty method under the income approach; this method estimates the cost savings generated by a company related to the ownership of an asset for which it would otherwise have had to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset and discounted to present value.\nPension and Other Postretirement Liabilities\nLinde recognized a pretax net liability representing the unfunded portion of Linde AG\u2019s defined-benefit pension and other postretirement benefit (\"OPEB\") plans. Refer to Note 18 for further information on pensions and OPEB arrangements.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe fair value for long-term debt was primarily obtained from third party quotes, as the majority of the Linde AG bond portfolio is publicly traded.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities\nThe deferred income tax assets and liabilities include the expected future federal, state and foreign tax consequences associated with temporary differences between the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the respective tax bases. Tax rates utilized in calculating deferred income taxes generally represent the enacted statutory tax rates at the effective date of the merger in the jurisdictions in which legal title of the underlying asset or liability resides.\nRefer to Note 7 for further information related to income taxes.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests include the fair value of noncontrolling interests of Linde AG, including approximately $3.2 billion relating to the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer and were the subject of a cash-merger squeeze-out. The company\u2019s wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Linde Intermediate Holding AG (\"Linde Holding\"), which directly owns the 92% of Linde AG shares acquired in the Exchange Offer, determined the adequate cash compensation to be paid to the 8% remaining Linde AG minority shareholders in exchange for the transfer of their Linde AG shares for each Linde AG share. The cash-merger squeeze-out was approved by the shareholders of Linde AG at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Linde AG on December 12, 2018 and completed on April 8, 2019. The remaining noncontrolling interests relate to the fair value of historic noncontrolling interests of Linde AG and its subsidiaries.\nEquity Investments\nThe fair value of equity investments was determined using a discounted cash flow approach.\nOther Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed (excluding Goodwill)\nLinde utilized the carrying values, net of allowances, to value accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable as well as other current assets and liabilities as it was determined that carrying values represented the fair value of those items at the merger date.\nGoodwill\nThe excess of the consideration for the merger over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The merger resulted in the recognition of $24,256 million of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, expanded market opportunities and cost and other operating synergies anticipated upon the integration of the operations of Praxair and Linde AG.\nResults of Linde AG Operations in 2018\nThe results of operations of Linde AG have been included in the company\u2019s consolidated statements of income since the merger. The following table provides Linde AG \u201cSales\u201d and \u201cIncome (loss) from continuing operations\u201d included in the company's results for the period November 1 through December 31, 2018.\n* Includes net charges of $451 million related to the impacts of purchase accounting.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information - 2018 and 2017\nLinde's unaudited pro forma results presented below were prepared pursuant to the requirements of ASC 805 and give effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2017. The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only, and do not necessarily represent what the revenue or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on January 1, 2017. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future operating results and do not reflect synergies that might be achieved.\nThe unaudited pro forma results include adjustments for the preliminary purchase accounting impact (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired tangible and intangible assets, amortization of the fair value adjustment to investment in nonconsolidated affiliates, and reduction of interest expense related to the fair value adjustment to long-term debt along with the related tax and non-controlling interest impacts), the alignment of accounting policies, adjustments due to IFRS compliant reporting conversion to U.S. GAAP and the elimination of transactions between Praxair and Linde AG.\nThe unaudited pro forma results for all periods presented below exclude the results of operations of the Linde AG merger-related divestitures (See Note 4) as these divestitures are reflected as discontinued operations. The Praxair merger-related divestitures (See Note 4) are included in the results from continuing operations, including the results from Praxair's European business through the disposition date of December 3, 2018, in the unaudited pro forma results presented below, for all periods presented, as these divestitures do not qualify for discontinued operations.\nThe unaudited pro forma results are summarized below:\n(a) Includes sales from Praxair's merger-related divestitures of $1,625 million and $1,553 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSignificant nonrecurring amounts reflected in the pro forma results are as follows:\nA $3,294 million gain ($2,923 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter 2018 as a result of the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business and is included in the December 31, 2018 pro forma income from continuing operations.\nFrom January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG collectively incurred pre-tax costs of $736 million ($680 million after tax) to prepare for and close the merger. These merger costs were reflected within the results of operations in the pro forma results as if they were incurred on January 1, 2017. Any costs incurred related to merger-related divestitures and integration and to prepare for the intended business separations were reflected in the pro forma results in the period in which they were incurred.\nThe company incurred pre-tax charges of $368 million ( $279 million after tax) and $10 million ($8 million after tax) in 2018 related to the fair value step-up of inventories acquired and sold as well as a pension settlement due to the payout to certain participants as a result of change in control provisions within a U.S. nonqualified pension plan, respectively. The 2018 pro forma results were adjusted to exclude these charges. The pro forma results for 2017 were adjusted to include these charges, as well as charges incurred subsequent to December 31, 2018 but less than a year from the date of the merger of $13 million ($10 million after tax) related to the remaining fair value step-up of inventories to be sold and $51 million ($40 million after tax) related to an additional pension settlement within the U.S. nonqualified pension plan that occurred in the first quarter of 2019 upon payment. See Note 18 for further information relating to the U.S. nonqualified pension plan settlements.\n2019 & 2018 Non-Merger Related Acquisitions\nNon-merger related acquisitions of $225 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, largely in the Americas, are not material, individually or in the aggregate.\n2017 Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Linde had acquisitions totaling $33 million, primarily acquisitions of packaged gas businesses and a carbon dioxide joint venture in North America.\nNOTE 4. MERGER-RELATED DIVESTITURES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE\nAs described in Note 1, as a condition of the European Commission (\"EC\"), the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), and other governmental regulatory authorities approval of the merger, Linde plc, Praxair and Linde AG were required to divest the following businesses:\nPraxair Merger-Related Divestitures - Primarily European Industrial Gases Business\nAs a condition of the EC regulatory approval of the merger transaction, Praxair agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases business in Europe. The sale was completed on December 3, 2018.\n\u2022\nThe Societ\u00e0 Italiana Acetilene e Derivati S.p.A. (\"SIAD\") Sale and Purchase Agreement dated December 5, 2017 whereby Praxair agreed, inter alia, to sell its 34% non-controlling participation in its Italian joint venture SIAD to its joint venture partner Flow Fin in exchange for Flow Fin\u2019s 40% non-controlling participation in Praxair\u2019s majority-owned Italian joint venture, Rivoira S.p.A., and cash payment of a net purchase price of \u20ac90 million ($102 million as of October 31, 2018) by Praxair to Flow Fin. This transaction was completed on October 31, 2018, and;\n\u2022\nThe Praxair Europe Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 5, 2018 pursuant to which Praxair sold the majority of its European businesses to Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation for \u20ac5,000 million in cash consideration ($5,700 million at December 3, 2018), reduced by estimated normal closing adjustments of \u20ac86 million ($96 million). These transactions were completed on December 3, 2018.\nIn connection with these transactions, in 2018 the company recognized a net pre-tax gain of $3,294 million ($2,923 million after tax) in the consolidated statements of income and related to the EMEA segment.\nThe net carrying value of Praxair's European business assets and liabilities divested on December 3, 2018 is presented below:\nAdditionally, to satisfy regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions, Praxair agreed to sell certain operations in Chile, China, India and South Korea. The Chilean business was sold as part of the Linde AG Americas SPA (as defined below), the select Indian assets were sold in July 2019, and other sales are expected in 2020. Effective October 22, 2018, the date of final regulatory approvals, these businesses have been accounted for as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. These businesses were evaluated for discontinued operations accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP and it was determined that they did not meet the definition of a discontinued operation as these transactions did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect, after considering the impact of the merger.\nThe sale of the select Indian assets was completed on July 12, 2019 with a sale price of $218 million and resulted in a gain of $164 million recognized in \"Net gain on sale of businesses\" in the consolidated statements of income.\nLinde AG Merger-Related Divestitures - Primarily Americas Industrial Gases Business\nAs a condition of the U.S. regulatory approval of the merger, Linde AG agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases business in the Americas, as described below:\n\u2022\nThe Linde AG Americas Sales and Purchase Agreement, dated July 16, 2018, as and further amended on September 22, 2018, October 19, 2018, and February 20, 2019 whereby Linde AG and Praxair, Inc. entered into an agreement with a consortium comprising companies of the German industrial gases manufacturer Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund VII to sell the majority of Linde AG\u2019s industrial gases business in North America and certain industrial gases business activities of Linde AG's in South America for $2.9 billion in cash consideration after purchase price adjustments for certain items relating to assets and liabilities of the sold businesses. In addition, divestitures include $0.5 billion of proceeds for incremental plant sales within the Americas under other agreements. These transactions were completed on March 1, 2019.\n\u2022\nOn April 30, 2019, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde Korea to IMM Private Equity Inc., to satisfy requirements of the Korea Fair Trade Commission. The assets divested include bulk and on-site business in Giheung, Pohang and Seosansites as well as oxygen and nitrogen on-site generators. The sale price of $1.2 billion is subject to customary adjustments.\n\u2022\nOn December 16, 2019, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde India with a sale price of $193 million.\nThe net carrying value of Linde AG's Americas business assets and liabilities divested on March 1, 2019 is presented below:\nThe net carrying value of Linde AG's South Korean business assets and liabilities divested on April 30, 2019 is presented below:\nDiscontinued Operations\nOnly the sales of the Linde AG merger-related divestitures meet the criteria for discontinued operations, Praxair merger-related divestitures do not qualify as discontinued operations. As such, operations related to the Linde AG merger-related divestitures are included within Income from discontinued operations, net of tax for periods subsequent to the merger, as summarized below:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 there were no material amounts of capital expenditures or significant operating or investing non-cash items related to discontinued operations.\nNet Assets Held for Sale\nNet assets held for sale includes both the Linde AG merger-related divestitures that meet the criteria for discontinued operations and the Praxair merger-related divestitures that do not. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the following assets and liabilities are reported as components of the net assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets:\nNOTE 5. COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND OTHER CHARGES\n2019 Charges\nCost reduction programs and other charges were $567 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 ($444 million, after-tax and noncontrolling interests). The following is a summary of the pre-tax charges by reportable segment for the year\nended December 31, 2019.\nCost Reduction Programs\nTotal cost reduction program related charges were $304 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 ($233 million after-tax).\nSeverance costs\nSeverance costs of $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 are for the elimination of approximately 2,400 positions, largely in EMEA, APAC, and the Americas, of which approximately 1,500 have terminated employment at December 31, 2019. The majority of these actions are anticipated to be completed within the next 12 months.\nOther cost reduction charges\nOther cost reduction charges of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 are primarily charges related to the execution of the company's synergistic actions including location consolidations and business rationalization projects, software and process harmonization, and associated non-recurring costs.\nTransaction Related and Other Charges\nOn October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG combined under Linde plc, as contemplated by the business combination agreement (see Note 1). Linde incurred merger-related costs and other charges which totaled $263 million ($211 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests) for the year ended December 31, 2019. 2019 includes other charges for an asset impairment related to a joint venture in APAC of approximately $73 million ($42 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests) resulting from an unfavorable arbitration ruling.\nCash Requirements\nThe total cash requirements of the cost reduction program and other charges during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 are estimated to be approximately $460 million, of which $260 million was paid through December 31, 2019. Total cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 also reflects the impact of cash payments of liabilities, included merger-related tax liabilities, accrued as of December 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the activities related to the company's cost reduction related charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019:\n2018 Charges\nCost reduction programs and other charges were $309 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 ($306 million, after-tax and non-controlling interest).\nTransaction Related and Other Charges\nOn October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG combined under Linde plc, as contemplated by the business combination agreement (see Note 1). In connection with the business combination, Linde incurred transaction costs which totaled $236 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 ($236 million after-tax).\nAlso included in Cost Reduction Programs and Other Charges are other charges of $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 ($70 million after-tax) comprised of the following; (i) a $40 million charge ($40 million after-tax) related to an unfavorable development related to a supplier contract in China, (ii) restructuring charges of $21 million ($18 million after-tax) and (iii) a $12 million charge ($12 million after-tax) associated with the transition to hyper-inflationary accounting in Argentina.\n2017 Charges\nTransaction Related and Other Charges\nIn connection with the intended business combination, Linde incurred transaction costs which totaled $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 ($48 million after-tax).\nClassification in the consolidated financial statements\nThe pre-tax charges for each year are shown within operating profit in a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income. In the consolidated balance sheets, reductions in assets are recorded against the carrying value of the related assets and unpaid amounts are recorded primarily as short-term liabilities. On the consolidated statements of cash flows, the pre-tax impact of these charges, net of cash payments, is shown as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities. In Note 20 - Segment Information, Linde excluded these charges from its management definition of segment operating profit; a reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit is shown within the segment operating profit table.\nNOTE 6. LEASES\nIn the normal course of its business, Linde enters into various leases as the lessee, primarily involving manufacturing and distribution equipment and office space. Linde determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Total lease and rental expenses related to operating lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $364 million, respectively. Operating leases costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. The related assets and obligations are included in other long term assets and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities, respectively. Total lease and rental expenses related to finance lease right of use assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $31 million, and the costs are included in depreciation and amortization and interest. Related assets and obligations are included in property, plant and equipment - net and debt, respectively. Linde includes renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the lease term. Operating and financing lease expenses above include short term and variable lease costs which are immaterial.\nAs most leases do not provide an implicit rate, Linde uses the applicable incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Linde determines incremental borrowing rates through market sources.\nThe company has elected to apply the short-term lease exception for all underlying asset classes. Short-term leases are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of twelve months or less and do not include a purchase option that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Leases that meet the short-term lease definition are not recognized on the balance sheet, but rather expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nSome leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage, output, or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance. The company does not have material variable lease payments.\nGains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions were immaterial. Operating cash flows used for operating leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $341 million. Cash flows used for finance leases for the same period were immaterial.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\nSupplemental operating lease information:\nFuture operating and finance lease payments as of December 31, 2019 are as follows (millions of dollars):\nPrior to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, operating and finance lease commitments on an undiscounted basis were approximately $1.3 billion and $104 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018 under long-term non-cancelable leases. The amounts payable for operating leases were as follows:\nIn limited instances Linde acts as a lessor, primarily for assets to provide industrial gas to specific customers. These leases are not significant to the consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\nNOTE 7. INCOME TAXES\nThe year ended December 31, 2019 reflects a full year of Linde plc; the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects Praxair for the entire year and Linde AG for the period beginning October 31, 2018 (the merger date), including the impacts of purchase accounting. The amounts for historical periods prior to 2018 solely reflect the results of Praxair. (See Notes 1 and 3.)\nPre-tax income applicable to U.S. and foreign operations is as follows:\n(a) 2019 includes a $164 million gain related to the Indian divestiture and 2018 includes a $3,294 million gain related to Europe divestiture (See Note 4).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following is an analysis of the provision for income taxes:\n(a)\n2019 includes $70 million related to divestitures, foreign current tax expense of $48 million and foreign deferred tax expense of $22 million\n(b)\n2018 includes a benefit of $61 million related to the Tax Act (See below) and a charge of $371 million ($252 million U.S., $4 million state, $114 million foreign current tax expense and $1 million of U.S. deferred income tax expense) related to divestitures (See Note 4).\n(c)\n2017 includes a charge of $394 million related to the Tax Act (See below).\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) 2018 and 2017\nOn December 22, 2017 the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). This comprehensive tax legislation significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax rules by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company recorded a net provisional income tax charge of $394 million comprising (i) an estimated $467 million U.S. Federal and state tax charge for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings; (ii) an estimated $260 million charge for foreign withholding taxes related to anticipated future repatriation of foreign earnings; and (iii) an estimated $333 million deferred tax benefit for the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the new 21% tax rate. The $467 million U.S. federal and state tax charge for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings includes $422 million of deemed repatriation tax payable over eight years.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the company completed its accounting and updated its provisional estimates in accordance with SAB 118 resulting in a net reduction to tax expense of $61 million, $41 million U.S. federal and $20 million of state income tax (net of federal tax benefit). This resulted in a deemed repatriation tax payable of $261 million and $291 million and is payable over the remaining six and seven years, respectively of which $235 million and $265 million is classified as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 as other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets (See Note 9).\nFurther, the Tax Act enacted new provisions related to the taxation of foreign earnings, known as GILTI. The company has elected as an accounting policy to account for GILTI as period costs when incurred.\nAdditionally, in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-02, \"Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\", electing to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Act from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"AOCI\") to retained earnings. This resulted in a net reduction to AOCI and a net increase to retained earnings of $93 million, $98 million directly related to the federal income tax rate change reduced by $5 million indirectly related to the federal tax rate change on state income taxes.\nEffective Tax Rate Reconciliation\nFor purposes of the effective tax rate reconciliation, the company utilized the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017. An analysis of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory income tax rate to pre-tax income follows:\n________________________\n(a)\nU.S. tax credits and deductions relate to foreign derived intangible income in 2019 and 2018, the research and experimentation tax credit in 2019, 2018 and 2017 and manufacturing deduction in 2017.\n(b)\nPrimarily related to differences between the U.S. tax rate (21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017) and the statutory tax rate in the countries where the company operates. Other permanent items and tax rate changes were not significant.\n(c)\nDivestitures primarily relate to the sale of the company\u2019s Indian business in 2019 and European business in 2018 (See Note 4).\n(d)\nOther - net includes $26 million and $34 million of U.S tax related to GILTI in 2019 and 2018, respectively and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits in Europe of $44 million in 2018.\nNet Deferred Tax Liabilities\nNet deferred tax liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets are comprised of the following:\n________________________\n(a)\nIncludes $255 million in 2019 related to right-of-use lease assets.\n(b)\nIncludes deferred taxes of $446 million and $292 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to pension / OPEB funded status (See Notes 9 and 18).\n(c)\nIncludes $255 million related to lease liabilities in 2019 and $81 million and $104 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to research and development costs.\n(d)\nSummary of valuation allowances relating to deferred tax assets follows (millions of dollars):\n(i)\n2017 includes a $59 million benefit related to the utilization of foreign tax credits under the Tax Act.\n(ii)\n2019 includes $26 million related to the squeeze out of Linde AG (See Note 3).\nThe company evaluates deferred tax assets quarterly to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. After considering the positive and negative evidence, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerable judgment is required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances.\nAt December 31, 2019, the company had $441 million of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and tax credits and $222 million of valuation allowances. These deferred tax assets include $312 million relating to NOLs of which $55 million expire within 5 years, $115 million expire after 5 years and $142 million have no expiration. The deferred tax assets also include $129 million related to credits of which $6 million expire within 5 years, $113 million expire after 5 years, and $10 million have no expiration. The valuation allowances of $222 million primarily relate to NOLs and are required because management has determined, based on financial projections and available tax strategies, that it is unlikely that the NOLs will be utilized before they expire. If events or circumstances change, valuation allowances are adjusted at that time resulting in an income tax benefit or charge.\nThe company has $664 million of foreign income taxes accrued related to its investments in subsidiaries and equity investments as of December 31, 2019. A provision has not been made for any additional foreign income tax at December 31, 2019 on approximately $31 billion related to its investments in subsidiaries because the company intends to remain indefinitely reinvested. While the $31 billion could become subject to additional foreign income tax if there is a sale of a subsidiary, or earnings are remitted as dividends, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nUnrecognized income tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The company has unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $472 million, $319 million and $54 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If recognized, essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n________________________\n(a)\nIncrease primarily relates to tax positions in the United States and Europe, $66 million in 2019 related to the merger with Linde AG.\n(b)\n2018 includes $167 million related to the merger with Linde AG.\n(c)\nSettlements are uncertain tax positions that were effectively settled with the taxing authorities, including positions where the company has agreed to amend its tax returns to eliminate the uncertainty.\nThe company classifies interest income and expense related to income taxes as tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The company recognized net interest expense of $1 million, $32 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The company had $65 million and $48 million of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively which were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (See Note 9).\nAs of December 31, 2019, the company remained subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions for the tax years as indicated below:\nThe company is currently under audit in a number of jurisdictions. As a result, it is reasonably possible that some of these matters will conclude or reach the stage where a change in unrecognized income tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months. At the time new information becomes available, the company will record any adjustment to income tax expense as required. Final determinations, if any, are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. The company is also subject to income taxes in many hundreds of state and local taxing jurisdictions that are open to tax examinations.\nNOTE 8. EARNINGS PER SHARE - LINDE PLC SHAREHOLDERS\nBasic and Diluted earnings per share - Linde plc shareholders is computed by dividing Income From Continuing Operations, Income From discontinued operations, net of tax, and Net income - Linde plc for the period by the weighted average number of either basic or diluted shares outstanding, as follows:\n* As a result of the merger, share amounts for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect a weighted average effect of Praxair shares outstanding prior to October 31, 2018 and Linde plc shares outstanding on and after October 31, 2018.\nThere were no antidilutive shares for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nNOTE 9. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 reflects Praxair for the entire year and the Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018 (the merger date), including the impacts of purchase accounting. The amounts for historical periods prior to 2018 solely reflect the results of Praxair. See Notes 1 and 3.\nIncome Statement\nBalance Sheet\n(a)\nDepreciation and amortization expense in 2019 include $1,298 million and $642 million, respectively, of Linde AG purchase accounting impacts. In 2018, depreciation and amortization expense include $225 million and $121 million, respectively, of Linde AG purchase accounting impacts.\n(b)\nIn December 2018, Linde repaid $600 million of 4.50% notes due 2019 and \u20ac600 million of 1.50% notes due 2020 resulting in a $26 million interest charge ($20 million after-tax).\n(c)\nNoncontrolling interests from continuing operations includes a $1 million benefit and a $35 million charge in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the 8% of Linde AG Shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer. Linde AG completed the cash merger squeeze-out of all its minority shares on April 8, 2019 (see Note 3).\nIn addition, 2019 and 2018 noncontrolling interests from continuing operations include $54 million and $24 million, respectively, of Linde AG purchase accounting impacts.\n(d)\nProvisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts were $170 million, $25 million, and $33 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The allowance activity in each period related primarily to write-offs of uncollectible amounts, net of recoveries and currency movements.\n(e)\nIncludes estimated income tax payments of $115 million and $172 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(f)\nConsists primarily of insurance contracts and other investments to be utilized for non-qualified pension and OPEB obligations.\n(g)\nLong-term receivables are not material and are largely reserved. The balances at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are net of reserves of $44 million and $46 million, respectively. The amounts in both periods relate primarily to long-term notes receivable from customers and government receivables in Brazil. Collectability is reviewed regularly and uncollectible amounts are written-off as appropriate.\n(h)\nAmericas consists of currency translation adjustments primarily in Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. EMEA relates primarily to Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden. APAC relates primarily to China, Korea, India and Australia.\nNOTE 10. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - NET\nSignificant classes of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n(a) - Depreciable lives of production plants related to long-term customer supply contracts are consistent with the contract lives.\n(b) - Land is not depreciated.\nNOTE 11. GOODWILL\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nLinde has historically performed its goodwill impairment tests annually during the second quarter of each year, and has determined that the fair value of each of its reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value. For the second quarter 2019 test, Linde applied the FASB's accounting guidance which allows the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine the extent of additional quantitative analysis, if any, that may be required to test goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, Linde concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore, further quantitative analysis was not required. As a result, no impairment was recorded.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from April 30 to October 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the company\u2019s planning process. The change in annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. The company has determined this change in the method of applying an accounting principle is preferable.\nLinde's impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2019 estimated the fair value of each reporting unit by applying multiples of earnings from a peer group to the company\u2019s forecasted earnings for the year ending December 31, 2019. The peer group is comprised of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics. Linde concluded the fair value of reporting units exceeded its carrying value and therefore recognized no impairment. There were no indicators of impairment through December 31, 2019. Reporting units with greater concentration of Linde AG assets fair valued during the recent merger are at greater risk of impairment in future periods.\nNOTE 12. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following is a summary of Linde\u2019s other intangible assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n________________________\n*\nOther primarily relates to the write-off of fully amortized assets and reclassifications.\nThere are no expected residual values related to these intangible assets. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $735 million, $215 million and $91 million, respectively. The remaining weighted-average amortization period for intangible assets is approximately 28 years.\nTotal estimated annual amortization expense related to finite-lived intangibles is as follows:\nNOTE 13. DEBT\nThe following is a summary of Linde\u2019s outstanding debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n________________________\n(a)\nAmounts are net of unamortized discounts, premiums and/or debt issuance costs as applicable.\n(b)\nIn February 2019, Linde repaid $500 million of 1.9% notes that became due; in May 2019 Linde repaid $150 million of variable notes that became due; in June 2019 Linde repaid \u20ac500 million of 1.75% notes that became due and the associated interest rate swap was settled; also in June 2019 Linde settled AUD100 million of variable rate notes that became due; and in August 2019 Linde repaid $200 million of variable rate notes that became due.\n(c)\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018 included a cumulative $38 million and $14 million adjustment to carrying value, respectively, related to hedge accounting of interest rate swaps.\nCredit Facilities\nOn March 26, 2019 the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement (\"the Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of banking institutions, which became effective on March 29, 2019. The Credit Agreement provides for total commitments of $5.0 billion, which may be increased up to $6.5 billion, subject to receipt of additional commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions. There are no financial maintenance covenants contained within the Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility expires on March 26, 2024 with the option to request two one-year extensions of the expiration date. In connection with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, Praxair and Linde AG terminated their major respective existing revolving credit facilities. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019.\nOn September 3, 2019 Linde and the company\u2019s subsidiaries Praxair and Linde AG entered into a series of parent and subsidiary guarantees related to currently outstanding notes issued by Praxair and Linde AG as well as the $5 billion Credit Agreement.\nOther Debt Information\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings outstanding was 0.6% for both periods.\nExpected maturities of long-term debt are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2019, the amount of Linde's assets pledged as collateral was immaterial.\nSee Note 15 for the fair value information related to debt.\nNOTE 14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nIn its normal operations, Linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and to a lesser extent precious metal prices. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the company\u2019s earnings and cash flows. To manage these risks, among other strategies, Linde routinely enters into various derivative financial instruments (\u201cderivatives\u201d) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, currency-swap agreements, forward contracts, currency options, and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.\nThere are three types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.\nWhen a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury-rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes; however, cross-currency interest rate contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting\npurposes. Certain currency contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.\nCounterparties to Linde\u2019s derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better. The company has Credit Support Annexes (\"CSAs\") in place with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default risk and to mitigate counterparty risk. Under the CSAs, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency management are collateralized with cash on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2019, the impact of such collateral posting arrangements on the fair value of derivatives was insignificant. Management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and any losses would be immaterial.\nThe following table is a summary of the notional amount and fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 for consolidated subsidiaries:\n(a) Current assets of $85 million are recorded in prepaid and other current assets; long-term assets of $82 million are recorded in other long-term assets; current liabilities of $54 million are recorded in other current liabilities; and long-term liabilities of $45 million are recorded in other long-term liabilities.\nBalance Sheet Items\nForeign currency contracts related to balance sheet items consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on recorded balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating unit. Certain forward currency contracts are entered into to protect underlying monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies from foreign exchange risk and are not designated as hedging instruments. For balance sheet items that are not designated as hedging instruments, the fair value adjustments on these contracts are offset by the fair value adjustments recorded on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities.\nForecasted Transactions\nForeign currency contracts related to forecasted transactions consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on (1) forecasted purchases of capital-related equipment and services, (2) forecasted sales, or (3) other forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating units. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are\nrecorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. For forecasted transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedging relationships, fair value adjustments are recorded directly to earnings.\nInterest Rate/Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swaps\nCross-currency interest rate swaps are entered into to limit the foreign currency risk of future principal and interest cash flows associated with intercompany loans, and to a more limited extent bonds, denominated in non-functional currencies. The fair value adjustments on the cross-currency swaps are recorded to earnings, where they are offset by fair value adjustments on the underlying intercompany loan or bond.\nCommodity Contracts\nCommodity contracts are entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, which arise in the normal course of business from its procurement transactions. To reduce the extent of this risk, Linde enters into a limited number of electricity, natural gas, and propane gas derivatives. The fair value adjustments for the majority of these contracts are recorded to AOCI and are eventually offset by the income statement impact of the underlying commodity purchase.\nNet investment hedges\nAs of December 31, 2019, Linde has not designated any hedges of net investment positions in foreign operations. Linde had previously designated Euro-denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges to reduce the company's exposure to changes in the currency exchange rate on investments in foreign subsidiaries with Euro functional currencies. Exchange rate movements of $206 million relating to the previously denominated Euro-denominated debt incurred in the financial periods prior to de-designation will remain in AOCI, until appropriate, such as upon sale or liquidation of the foreign operations at which time amounts will be reclassified to the consolidated statements of income. Exchange rate movements related to the Euro-denominated debt occurring after de-designation are shown in the consolidated statements of income.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nLinde uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of interest rate changes. These interest rate swaps effectively convert fixed-rate interest exposures to variable rates; fair value adjustments are recognized in earnings along with an equally offsetting charge/benefit to earnings for the changes in the fair value of the underlying financial asset or financial liability. The notional value of outstanding interest rate swaps of Linde with maturity dates from 2020 through 2028 was $1,908 million at December 31, 2019 and $2,164 at December 31, 2018 (see Note 13 for further information).\nTerminated Treasury Rate Locks\nThe unrecognized aggregate losses related to terminated treasury rate lock contracts on the underlying $500 million 3.00% fixed-rate notes that mature in 2021 and the $500 million 2.20% fixed-rate notes that mature in 2022 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were $2 million (net of taxes of $1 million) and $2 million (net of taxes of $1 million), respectively. The unrecognized gains/(losses) for the treasury rate locks are shown in AOCI and are being recognized on a straight line basis to interest expense - net over the term of the underlying debt agreements.\nImpact of derivative instruments on earnings and AOCI\nThe following table summarizes the impact of the company's derivatives on the consolidated statements of income:\n* The gains (losses) on balance sheet items are offset by gains (losses) recorded on the underlying hedged assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the gains (losses) for the derivatives and the underlying hedged assets and liabilities related to debt items are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as interest expense-net. Other balance sheet items and anticipated net income gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as other income (expenses)-net.\nThe amounts of gain or loss recognized in AOCI and reclassified to the consolidated statement of income was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net losses expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are also not material.\nThe gains (losses) on net investment hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI within foreign currency translation adjustments in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The gains (losses) on treasury rate locks are recorded as a component of AOCI within derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The gains (losses) on net investment hedges are reclassified to earnings only when the related currency translation adjustments are required to be reclassified, usually upon sale or liquidation of the investment. The gains (losses) for interest rate contracts are reclassified to earnings as interest expense -net on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the underlying debt.\nNOTE 15. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable\nLevel 3 - inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n*\nInvestments and securities are recorded in prepaid and other current assets and other long-term assets in the company's consolidated balance sheets.\nLevel 1 investments and securities are marketable securities traded on an exchange. Level 2 investments are based on market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions. Level 3 investments and securities consist of a venture fund. For the valuation, Linde uses the net asset value received as part of the fund's quarterly reporting, which for the most part is not based on quoted prices in active markets. In order to reflect current market conditions, Linde proportionally adjusts these by observable market data (stock exchange prices) or current transaction prices.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in level 3 investments and securities for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gains (losses) recognized in earnings are recorded to interest expense - net in the company's consolidated statements of income.\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, accounts receivable-net, and accounts payable approximate carrying value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.\nThe fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. Long-term debt is categorized within either Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on the trading volume of the issues and whether or not they are actively quoted in the market as opposed to traded through over-the-counter transactions. At December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of Linde\u2019s long-term debt portfolio was $12,375 million versus a carrying value of $12,224 million. At December 31, 2018 the estimated fair value of Linde\u2019s long-term debt portfolio was $13,725 million versus a carrying value of $13,811 million. As Linde AG's assets and liabilities were measured at estimated fair value as of the merger date, differences between the carrying value and the fair value not significant; remaining differences are attributable to interest rate increases subsequent to when the debt was issued and relative to stated coupon rates.\nNOTE 16. EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nLinde plc Shareholders\u2019 Equity\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, Linde has total authorized share capital of \u20ac1,825,000 divided into 1,750,000,000 ordinary shares of \u20ac0.001 each, 25,000 A ordinary shares of \u20ac1.00 each, 25,000 deferred shares of \u20ac1.00 each and 25,000,000 preferred shares of \u20ac0.001 each.\nAt December 31, 2019 there were 552,012,862 and 534,380,544 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2019 there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding.\nAt December 31, 2018 there were 551,310,272 and 547,241,630 of Linde plc ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2018, there were no shares of A ordinary shares, deferred shares or preferred shares issued or outstanding.\nLinde\u2019s Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock and, in connection with the creation of such series, determine the characteristics of each such series including, without limitation, the preference and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the series.\n2018 Merger of Praxair and Linde AG\nFollowing is a summary of the Linde plc shareholders' equity transactions related to the merger:\n(a)\nThe total fair value of consideration transferred for the merger was $43,288 million, resulting in an increase to \"Additional paid-in capital\" in stockholders' equity (see Note 3 for additional information).\n(b)\nOn October 31, 2018, the conversion of Praxair common stock and Linde AG common stock into Linde ordinary shares resulted in a $3 million decrease to \"Ordinary Shares\" with a corresponding increase to \"Additional paid-in capital\" in stockholders' equity.\n(c)\nEach share of Praxair common stock held in treasury immediately prior to the merger was canceled. The elimination of Praxair's historical treasury stock at cost resulted in a $7,113 million decrease in \"Treasury stock\" and \"Additional paid-in capital\" in stockholders' equity.\nAs indicated above, in connection with the merger, Praxair and Linde AG common stock was converted into shares of Linde plc ordinary shares. The following table provides a summary of the share activity resulting from the merger:\n(i)\nNumber of Linde AG shares tendered in the 2017 Exchange Offer.\n(ii)\nExchange ratio for Linde AG shares as set forth in the business combination agreement.\nOther Linde plc Ordinary Share and Treasury Stock Transactions\nLinde may issue new ordinary shares for dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans and employee savings and incentive plans. The number of new Linde ordinary shares issued from the merger date through December 31, 2019 was 958,293 shares.\nOn December 10, 2018 the Linde board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 6,385,887 shares through December 31, 2019 (4,068,642 shares were repurchased through December 31, 2018). Linde completed the repurchases under this program in the first quarter of 2019.\nSubsequently, on January 22, 2019 the company\u2019s board of directors approved the additional repurchase of $6.0 billion of its ordinary shares under which Linde had repurchased 12,016,083 shares through December 31, 2019.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interest ownership changes are presented within the consolidated statements of equity. The $2,921 million decrease during 2019 was primarily driven by Linde AG completion of the cash merger squeeze-out of all its minority shares on April 8, 2019. This represents the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer and were the subject of a cash-merger squeeze-out (See Note 3).\nThe $186 million decrease during 2018 primarily relates to the sale of Praxair's industrial gases business in Europe (see Notes 1 and 4). The \"Impact of Merger\" line item of the consolidated statements of equity includes the fair value of the noncontrolling interests acquired from Linde AG, including the 8% of Linde AG shares which were not tendered in the Exchange Offer and were intended to be the subject of a cash-merger squeeze-out (See Note 3).\nThe $15 million increase during 2017 relates to additional funding provided to PG Technologies, LLC (\"PGT\") by the joint venture partner.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put/sell options, that are not solely within the company\u2019s control (\u201credeemable noncontrolling interests\u201d) are reported separately in the consolidated balance sheets at the greater of carrying value or redemption value. For redeemable noncontrolling interests that are not yet exercisable, Linde calculates the redemption value by accreting the carrying value to the redemption value over the period until exercisable. If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, any increase is adjusted directly to retained earnings and does not impact net income. At December 31, 2019, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance includes industrial gas businesses in EMEA and Americas where the noncontrolling shareholders have put options.\nNOTE 17. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nShare-based compensation expense was $95 million in 2019 ($62 million and $59 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively). The related income tax benefit recognized was $42 million in 2019 ($30 million and $53 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively). The expense was primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and no share-based compensation expense was capitalized.\nSummary of Plans\nThe 2009 Praxair, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan was initially adopted by the board of directors and shareholders of Praxair, Inc. on April 28, 2009 and has been amended since its initial adoption (\"the 2009 Plan\"). Upon completion of the business combination of Praxair, Inc. with Linde AG on October 31, 2018, the 2009 Plan was assumed by the company. Prior to April 28, 2009, Praxair, Inc. granted equity awards under the 2002 Praxair, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan , (\u201cthe 2002 Plan\u201d) which was also assumed by the company upon completion of the business combination. The 2009 Plan permits awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance-based stock units and other equity awards to eligible officer and non-officer employees and non-employee directors of the company and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2019, 6,454,428 shares remained available for equity grants under the 2009 Plan, of which 1,757,354 shares may be granted as awards other than options or stock appreciation rights.\nIn 2005, the board of directors and shareholders of Praxair, Inc. adopted the 2005 Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Praxair, Inc. (\"the 2005 Plan\"). Upon completion of the business combination in October 2018, the 2005 Plan was also assumed by the company. Under the 2005 Plan, the aggregate number of shares available for option and other equity grants was limited to a total of 500,000 shares. The 2005 Plan expired on April 30, 2010, by its own terms, and no shares were available for grant thereafter.\nUpon the completion of the business combination, all options outstanding under the 2009 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2005 Plan were converted into options to acquire the same number of shares of the company and at the same exercise price per share that applied prior to the business combination.\nExercise prices for options granted under the 2009 Plan may not be less than the closing market price of the company\u2019s ordinary shares on the date of grant and granted options may not be re-priced or exchanged without shareholder approval. Options granted under the 2009 Plan subject only to time vesting requirements may become partially exercisable after a minimum of one year after the date of grant but may not become fully exercisable until at least three years have elapsed from the date of grant, and all options have a maximum duration of ten years. Options granted under predecessor plans had similar terms.\nIn connection with the business combination, on October 31, 2018 the company's Board of Directors adopted the Long Term Incentive Plan 2018 of Linde plc (\u201cthe LTIP 2018\u201d), the purpose of which is to replace certain outstanding Linde AG equity based awards that were terminated. Under the LTIP 2018, the aggregate number of shares available for replacement option rights and replacement restricted share units was set at 473,128. As of December 31, 2019, 260,794 shares remained available for grant, and since the company was obligated to make these replacement awards in 2019, it does not anticipate any further grants under this plan.\nExercise prices for the replacement option rights that were granted in 2019 under the LTIP 2018 were equal to EUR 1.67 ($1.92 as converted at an exchange rate from the time the exchange offer was completed as the option rights are exercisable in U.S. dollars on the NYSE) as prescribed in the business combination agreement. Each replacement option right granted under the LTIP 2018 is subject to vesting based on continued service until the end of the four-year waiting period applicable to the relevant Linde AG award that had been granted before the business combination. After vesting, each option right will be exercisable for one year.\nIn order to satisfy option exercises and other equity grants, the company may issue authorized but previously unissued shares or it may issue treasury shares.\nStock Option Fair Value\nThe company utilizes the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing Model to determine the fair value of stock options consistent with that used in prior years. Management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs, including anticipated changes in the underlying stock price (i.e., expected volatility) and option exercise activity (i.e., expected life). Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company\u2019s stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the company\u2019s stock options and other factors. The expected life of options granted, which represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding, is based primarily on historical exercise experience. The expected dividend yield is based on the company\u2019s most recent history and expectation of dividend payouts. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life. If factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods, the stock option\nexpense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period.\nThe weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2019 was $23.38 ($19.29 in 2018 and $12.40 in 2017) based on the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing model. The increase in grant date fair value year-over-year is primarily attributable to the increase in the company's stock price. The weighted-average fair value of replacement option rights granted in 2019 was $160.08 based on intrinsic value method.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to value the grants in 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nThe following table summarizes option activity under the plans as of December 31, 2019 and changes during the period then ended (averages are calculated on a weighted basis; life in years; intrinsic value expressed in millions):\nThe aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the company\u2019s closing stock price of $212.90 as of December 31, 2019 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in the money options outstanding as of that date. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2019 was $219 million ($113 million and $137 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively).\nCash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2019 was $64 million ($66 million and $107 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively). The cash tax benefit realized from share-based compensation totaled $56 million for 2019 ($30 million and $51 million cash tax benefit in 2018 and 2017, respectively).\nAs of December 31, 2019, $32 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1 year.\nPerformance-Based and Restricted Stock Awards\nIn 2019, Linde granted 261,760 performance-based stock awards under the 2009 Plan to senior management that vest, subject to the attainment of pre-established minimum performance criteria, principally on the third anniversary of their date of grant. These awards are tied to either after tax return on capital (\"ROC\") performance or relative total shareholder return (\"TSR\") performance versus that of the S&P 500 (weighted 67%) and Eurofirst 300 (weighted 33%). The actual number of shares issued in settlement of a vested award can range from zero to 200 percent of the target number of shares granted based upon the company\u2019s attainment of specified performance targets at the end of a three-year period. Compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the three-year performance period based on the fair value of the closing market price of the company\u2019s ordinary shares on the date of the grant and the estimated performance that will be achieved. Compensation expense for ROC awards will be adjusted during the three-year performance period based upon the estimated performance levels that will be achieved. TSR awards are measured at their grant date fair value and not subsequently re-measured.\nThe weighted-average fair value of ROC performance-based stock awards granted in 2019 was $168.47, and during 2017 was $109.68. These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. There were no ROC performance-based stock awards granted in 2018.\nThe weighted-average fair value of performance-based stock tied to relative TSR performance granted in 2019 was $215.85, and during 2017 was $124.12, and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation performed as of the grant date. There were no performance-based stock tied to relative TSR performance granted in 2018.\nUpon completion of the merger, each outstanding ROC and TSR performance-based award granted prior to 2018 was converted into a Linde RSU based on performance achieved as of immediately prior to the closing of the merger, and became subject to service-vesting conditions only. This resulted in the conversion of 435,000 performance-based shares into 704,000 restricted stock units. Compensation expense related to these awards will continue to be recognized over the remainder of the respective three-year service period.\nThere were 161,072 restricted stock units granted to employees by Linde during 2019. The weighted-average fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2019 was $165.04 ($144.86 in 2018 and $111.95 in 2017). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting period.\nThe following table summarizes non-vested performance-based and restricted stock award activity as of December 31, 2019 and changes during the period then ended (shares based on target amounts, averages are calculated on a weighted basis):\nThere are approximately 7 thousand performance-based shares and 11 thousand restricted stock shares that are non-vested at December 31, 2019 which will be settled in cash due to foreign regulatory limitations. The liability related to these grants reflects the current estimate of performance that will be achieved and the current share price.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $23 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to performance-based awards and $21 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the restricted stock awards is expected to be recognized primarily through the first quarter of 2022.\nNOTE 18. RETIREMENT PROGRAMS\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans - U.S.\nLinde has two main U.S. retirement programs which are non-contributory defined benefit plans: the Linde U.S. Pension Plan and the CBI Pension Plan. The latter program benefits primarily former employees of CBI Industries, Inc. which Linde acquired in 1996. Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde U.S. Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time choice to remain covered by the old formula or to elect coverage under a new formula. The old formula is based predominantly on years of service, age and compensation levels prior to retirement, while the new formula provides for an annual contribution to an individual account which grows with interest each year at a predetermined rate. Also, this new formula applies to all new employees hired after April 30, 2002 into businesses adopting this plan. The U.S. and international pension plan assets are comprised of a diversified mix of investments, including domestic and international corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher level employees that are unfunded and are nonqualified for federal tax purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde\u2019s international subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through separate plans. Obligations under such plans are primarily provided for through diversified investment portfolios, with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans - International\nLinde has international, defined benefit commitments primarily in Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.). The defined benefit commitments in Germany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the performance of the corresponding investment. There are no minimum funding requirements. The pension obligations in Germany are partly funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted.\nMulti-employer Pension Plans\nIn the United States Linde participates in eight multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (\"MEPs\"), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, that cover approximately 200 union-represented employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire on different dates through 2026. In connection with such agreements, the company is required to make periodic contributions to the MEPs in accordance with the terms of the respective collective bargaining agreements. Linde\u2019s participation in these plans is not material either at the plan level or in the aggregate. Linde\u2019s contributions to these plans were $2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow). For all MEPs, Linde\u2019s contributions were significantly less than 1% of the total contributions to each plan for 2018 and 2017. Total 2019 contributions were not yet available from the MEPs.\nLinde has obtained the most recently available Pension Protection Act (\"PPA\") annual funding notices from the Trustees of the MEPs. The PPA classifies MEPs as either Red, Yellow or Green Zone plans. Among other factors, plans in the Red Zone are generally less than 65 percent funded with a projected insolvency date within the next twenty years; plans in the Yellow Zone are generally 65 to 80 percent funded; and plans in the Green Zone are generally at least 80 percent funded. Red Zone plans are considered to be in \"critical\" or \"critical and declining\" status, while Yellow Zone plans are considered to be in \"endangered\" status. Plans that are in neither \"critical\" nor \"endangered\" status are considered to have Green Zone status. According to the most recent data available, four of the MEPs that the company participates in are in a Red Zone status and four are in a Green Zone status. As of December 31, 2019, the four Red Zone plans have pending or have implemented financial improvement or rehabilitation plans. Linde does not currently anticipate significant future obligations due to the funding status of these plans. If Linde determined it was probable that it would withdraw from an MEP, the company would record a liability for its portion of the MEP\u2019s unfunded pension obligations, as calculated at that time. Historically, such withdrawal payments have not been significant.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nLinde\u2019s U.S. business employees are eligible to participate in the Linde defined contribution savings plan. Employees may contribute up to 40% of their compensation, subject to the maximum allowable by IRS regulations. For the U.S. packaged gases business, company contributions to this plan are calculated as a percentage of salary based on age plus service. U.S. employees other than those in the packaged gases business have company contributions to this plan calculated on a graduated scale based on employee contributions to the plan. The cost for these defined contribution plans was $47 million in 2019, $33 million in 2018 and $29 million in 2017 (these costs are not included in the tables that follow).\nThe defined contribution plans include a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") which covers all employees participating in this plan. The collective number of shares of Linde ordinary shares in the ESOP totaled 2,070,100 at December 31, 2019.\nCertain international subsidiaries of the company also sponsor defined contribution plans where contributions are determined under various formulas. The expense for these plans was $95 million in 2019, $32 million in 2018 and $21 million in 2017 (these expenses are not included in the tables that follow).\nPostretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)\nLinde provides health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees. These benefits are provided through various insurance companies and healthcare providers. The company does not currently fund its postretirement benefits obligations. Linde\u2019s retiree plans may be changed or terminated by Linde at any time for any reason with no liability to current or future retirees.\nLinde uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Costs\nThe components of net pension and postretirement benefits other than pension (\"OPEB\") costs for 2019, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the table below (2018 reflects the impact of the Linde AG merger on October 31, 2018 (see Notes 1 and 3) and the divestiture of Praxair's European industrial gases business on December 3, 2018 (see Notes 1 and 4)):\n(a) In 2019, Linde recorded curtailment gains of $9 million and a charge of $17 million for termination benefits, primarily in connection with a defined benefit pension plan freeze. The curtailment gain recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the termination of an OPEB plan in South America in the first quarter.\n(b) In the third and fourth quarters of 2019, Linde recorded pension settlement charges of $40 million and $6 million, respectively, related to lump sum payments made from a U.S. qualified plan. These payments were triggered by merger-related divestitures. In the first quarter of 2019, benefits of $91 million were paid related to the settlement of a U.S. non-qualified plan. Such benefits were triggered by a change in control provision and resulted in a settlement charge of $51 million.\n2018 includes the impact of a $4 million charge and a $10 million charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. In the third quarter, a series of lump sum benefit payments made from the U.S. supplemental pension plan triggered a settlement of the related pension obligation. In the fourth quarter, a change in control provision triggered the settlement of a U.S. non-qualified plan.\n2017 includes the impact of a $2 million charge related to a series of lump sum benefit payments for employees under an international pension plan.\n(c) In connection with Praxair merger-related divestitures, primarily the European industrial gases business, certain European pension plan obligations were settled. This resulted in the recognition of associated pension benefit obligations and deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within operating profit in the \"Net gain on sale of businesses\" line item.\nFunded Status\nChanges in the benefit obligation and plan assets for Linde\u2019s pension and OPEB programs, including reconciliation of the funded status of the plans to amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are shown below.\n(a) Represents Linde AG plan assets and benefit obligations assumed as part of the merger. Such plan assets and benefit obligations were remeasured as of the merger date and all subsequent activity through December 31, 2018 is presented within the respective captions above.\n(b) Represents plan assets and benefit obligations associated with the divestiture of the majority of the Praxair industrial gases business in Europe.\nComparative funded status information as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 for select international pension plans is presented in the table below as the benefit obligations of these plans are considered to be significant relative to the total benefit obligation:\nThe changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income in 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\n________________________\n*\nPension net actuarial losses in 2019 are largely driven by lower discount rates across all significant pension plans. In the U.S., the benefit from the actual return on assets more than offset the impacts of unfavorable liability experience, resulting from the low discount rate environment. For the international plans, the unfavorable impact of lower discount rates outweighed favorable plan asset experience. Pension net actuarial losses in 2018 are driven by lower U.S. discount rates, which more than offset favorable plan asset experience. OPEB net actuarial losses in 2019 relate to the low interest rate environment, which was partially offset by favorable actual benefit payment experience. Net actuarial gains in 2018 relate to the benefits from higher U.S. discount rates and favorable actual participant experience.\nThe amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost during 2020 are as follows:\nThe following table provides information for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets:\nAssumptions\nThe assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as of the respective balance sheet dates and the assumptions\nused to determine net benefit cost are as of the previous year-end, as shown below:\n________________________\n(1)\nThe expected long term rate of return on the U.S. and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.27% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 8.5% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.3% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 6.8% expected return). For the international plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.1% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 4.8% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5.2% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10-year period ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 9.2%. For the international plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 7.0%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. Expected weighted average returns for international plans will vary.\nThese healthcare cost trend rate assumptions have an impact on the amounts reported. However, cost caps limit the impact on the net OPEB benefit cost in the U.S. To illustrate the effect, a one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare\ncost trend rates would have the following effects:\nPension Plan Assets\nThe investments of the U.S. pension plan are managed to meet the future expected benefit liabilities of the plan over the long term by investing in diversified portfolios consistent with prudent diversification and historical and expected capital market returns. Investment strategies are reviewed by management and investment performance is tracked against appropriate benchmarks. There are no concentrations of risk as it relates to the assets within the plans. The international pension plans are managed individually based on diversified investment portfolios, with different target asset allocations that vary for each plan. Linde\u2019s U.S. and international pension plans\u2019 weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the target asset allocation range for 2019, by major asset category, are as follows:\nThe following table summarizes pension assets measured at fair value by asset category at December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the years presented, there has been no transfer of assets between Levels 1, 2 and 3 (see Note 15 for definition of the levels):\n* Pooled funds are measured using the net asset value (\"NAV\") as a practical expedient for fair value as permissible under the accounting standard for fair value measurements and have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy.\n** The following table summarizes changes in fair value of the pension plan assets classified as level 3 for the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nThe descriptions and fair value methodologies for the company's pension plan assets are as follows:\nCash and Cash Equivalents - This category includes cash and short-term interest bearing investments with maturities of three months or less. Investments are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Cash and cash equivalents are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nEquity Securities - This category is comprised of shares of common stock in U.S. and international companies from a diverse set of industries and size. Common stock is valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. or international exchange where the security is actively traded. Equity securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nMutual Funds - These categories consist of publicly and privately managed funds that invest primarily in marketable equity and fixed income securities. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying securities of the fund. Shares of publicly traded mutual funds are valued at the net asset value quoted on the exchange where the fund is traded and are primarily classified as level 1 within the valuation hierarchy.\nU.S. and International Government Bonds - This category includes U.S. treasuries, U.S. federal agency obligations and international government debt. The majority of these investments do not have quoted market prices available for a specific government security and so the fair value is determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and is classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.\nCorporate Bonds - This category is comprised of corporate bonds of U.S. and international companies from a diverse set of industries and size. The fair values for U.S. and international corporate bonds are determined using quoted prices of similar securities in active markets and observable data or broker or dealer quotations. The fair values for these investments are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.\nPooled Funds - Pooled fund NAVs are provided by the trustee and are determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying securities of the trust, less its liabilities, which are valued primarily through the use of directly or indirectly observable inputs. Depending on the pooled fund, underlying securities may include marketable equity securities or fixed income securities.\nBank Loans - This category is comprised of traded syndicated loans of larger corporate borrowers. Such loans are issued by sub-investment grade rated companies both in the U.S. and internationally and are syndicated by investment banks to institutional investors. They are regularly traded in an active dealer market comprised of large investment banks, which supply bid and offer quotes and are therefore classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nLiquid Alternative Investments - This category is comprised of investments in alternative mutual funds whose holdings include liquid securities, cash, and derivatives. Such funds focus on diversification and employ a variety of investing strategies including long/short equity, multi-strategy, and global macro. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the net asset value of the underlying holdings of the fund, which can be determined using observable data (e.g., indices, yield curves, quoted prices of similar securities), and is classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nInsurance Contracts - The fair value of insurance contracts is determined based on the cash surrender value of the insurance contract, which is determined based on such factors as the fair value of the underlying assets and discounted cash flows. These contracts are with highly rated insurance companies. Insurance contracts are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.\nReal Estate Funds - This category includes real estate properties, partnership equities and investments in operating companies. The fair value of the assets is determined using discounted cash flows by estimating an income stream for the property plus a reversion into a present value at a risk adjusted rate. Yield rates and growth assumptions utilized are derived from market transactions as well as other financial and industry data. The fair value for these investments are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.\nPrivate Debt - This category includes non-traded, privately-arranged loans between one or a small group of private debt investment managers and corporate borrowers, which are typically too small to access the syndicated market and have no credit rating. This category also includes similar loans to real estate companies or individual properties. Loans included in this category are valued at par value, are held to maturity or to call, and are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.\nContributions\nAt a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the United States). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of the cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Pension contributions were $94 million in 2019, $87 million in 2018 and $19 million in 2017. Estimated required contributions for 2020 are currently expected to be in the range of $50 million to $80 million.\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments, net of participant contributions:\nNOTE 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe company accrues non income-tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they will be charged against income at that time. Attorney fees are recorded as incurred. Commitments represent obligations, such as those for future purchases of goods or services, that are not yet recorded on the company\u2019s balance sheet as liabilities. The company records liabilities for commitments when incurred (i.e., when the goods or services are received).\nContingent Liabilities\nLinde is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. Linde has strong defenses in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s reported results of operations in any given period.\nSignificant matters are:\n\u2022\nDuring May 2009, the Brazilian government published Law 11941/2009 instituting a new voluntary amnesty program (\u201cRefis Program\u201d) which allowed Brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at reduced amounts. During the 2009 third quarter, the company decided that it was economically beneficial to settle many of its outstanding federal tax disputes and such disputes were enrolled in the Refis Program, subject to final calculation and review by the Brazilian federal government. The company recorded estimated liabilities based on the terms of the Refis Program. Since 2009, Linde has been unable to reach final agreement on the calculations and initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain items. Open issues relate to the following matters: (i) application of cash deposits and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligations and (ii) the amount of tax reductions available under the Refis Program. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal matters in Brazil.\n\u2022\nAt December 31, 2019 the most significant non-income and income tax claims in Brazil, after enrollment in the Refis Program, relate to state VAT tax matters and a federal income tax matter where the taxing authorities are challenging the tax rate that should be applied to income generated by a subsidiary company. The total estimated exposure relating to such claims, including interest and penalties, as appropriate, is approximately $260 million. Linde has not recorded any liabilities related to such claims based on management judgments, after considering judgments and opinions of outside counsel. Because litigation in Brazil historically takes many years to resolve, it is very difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters; however, it is possible that certain of these matters may be resolved within the near term. The company is vigorously defending against the proceedings.\n\u2022\nOn September 1, 2010, CADE (Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense) announced alleged anticompetitive activity on the part of five industrial gas companies in Brazil and imposed fines. Originally, CADE imposed a civil fine of R$2.2 billion Brazilian reais ($546 million) on White Martins, the Brazil-based subsidiary of Praxair, Inc. The fine was reduced to R$1.7 billion Brazilian reais ($422 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. On September 14, 2015, the fine against White Martins was overturned by the Ninth Federal Court of Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision on June 30, 2016.\nSimilarly, on September 1, 2010, CADE imposed a civil fine of R$237 million Brazilian reais ($59 million) on Linde Gases Ltda., the former Brazil-based subsidiary of Linde AG, which was divested to MG Industries GmbH on March 1, 2019 and with respect to which Linde provided a contractual indemnity. The fine was reduced to R$188 million Brazilian reais ($47 million) due to a calculation error made by CADE. On May 6, 2014 the fine against Linde Gases Ltda. was overturned by the Seventh Federal Court in Brasilia. CADE appealed this decision on October 27, 2016.\nLinde has strong defenses and is confident that it will prevail on appeal and have the fines overturned. Linde strongly believes that the allegations of anticompetitive activity against our current and former Brazilian subsidiaries are not supported by valid and sufficient evidence. Linde believes that this decision will not stand up to judicial review and deems the possibility of cash outflows to be extremely unlikely. As a result, no reserves have been recorded as management does not believe that a loss from this case is probable.\n\u2022\nOn and after April 23, 2019 former shareholders of Linde AG filed appraisal proceedings at the District Court (Landgericht) Munich I (Germany), seeking an increase of the cash consideration paid in connection with the previously completed cash merger squeeze-out of all of Linde AG\u2019s minority shareholders for \u20ac189.46 per share. Any such increase would apply to all 14,763,113 Linde AG shares that were outstanding on April 8, 2019, when the cash merger squeeze-out was completed. The period for plaintiffs to file claims expired on July 9, 2019. The company believes the consideration paid was fair and that the claims lack merit, and no reserve has been established. We cannot estimate the timing of resolution.\nCommitments\nAt December 31, 2019, Linde had undrawn outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds valued at approximately $3,276 million from financial institutions. These relate primarily to customer contract performance guarantees (including plant construction in connection with certain on-site contracts), self-insurance claims and other commercial and governmental requirements, including foreign litigation matters.\nOther commitments related to leases, tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, long-term debt, other post retirement and pension obligations are summarized elsewhere in the financial statements (see Notes 6, 7, 13, and 18).\nNOTE 20. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nEffective October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG completed the previously announced merger, resulting in the formation of Linde plc (see Note 1 for additional information on the merger). As a result of the merger and effective with the lifting of the hold separate order effective on March 1, 2019, new operating segments were created which are used by the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") to allocate company resources and assess performance. Linde\u2019s operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde\u2019s industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represent three of the company's new reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which represents the company's Engineering business, designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all three geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation.\nThe industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde\u2019s industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer\u2019s needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.\nThe company\u2019s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes remains unchanged - Segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company\u2019s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources. Similarly, total assets have not been included as this is not provided to the CODM for their assessment. For a description of Linde's previous operating segments, refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements of Linde's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below presents information about reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the results of both Praxair and Linde AG for the entire year. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018 (the merger date), including the impacts of purchase accounting (See Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The historical periods prior to 2018 reflect the results of Praxair. Prior periods presented have been recast to be consistent with the new segment structure:\n________________________\n(a)\nSales reflect external sales only and include Linde AG sales from the merger date of October 31, 2018 forward. Intersegment sales, primarily from Engineering to the industrial gases segments, were not material.\n(b)\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment - net and reflect the impact of the merger with Linde AG (refer to Note 3).\n21. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services.\nContracts with Customers\nApproximately 83% of Linde's consolidated sales are generated from industrial gases and related products in three geographic segments (Americas, EMEA, and APAC) and the remaining 17% is related primarily to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent Other (see Note 20 for operating segment details). Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, energy, manufacturing, food, beverage carbonation, fiber-optics, steel making, aerospace, chemicals and water treatment.\nIndustrial Gases\nWithin each of the company\u2019s geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer\u2019s volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers\u2019 sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. Where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\nThe company\u2019s performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site. Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\nThe company\u2019s performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable components of consideration within merchant contracts are constrained however this consideration is not significant.\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer\u2019s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\nThe company\u2019s performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Any variable consideration is constrained and will be recognized when the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved.\nLinde Engineering\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. Contract assets primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. The balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. Customer invoices may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. Contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde has contract assets of $368 million at December 31, 2019. Total contract liabilities are $2,106 million at December 31, 2019 (current of $1,758 million and $348 million within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets). Total contract liabilities were $1,934 million at December 31, 2018 (current contract liabilities of $1,546 million, $234 million classified as deferred income within other current liabilities and $154 million in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets). Revenue recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 that was included in the contract liability at December 31, 2018 was $1,168 million. Contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Linde Engineering business acquired in the merger. The industrial gases business does not typically have material contract assets or liabilities.\nPayment Terms and Other\nLinde generally receives payment after performance obligations are satisfied, and customer prepayments are not typical for the industrial gases business. Payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local customary payment practices. Linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in sales within the consolidated statement of income. Additionally, sales returns and allowances are not a normal practice in the industry and are not significant.\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAs described above and in Note 20, the company manages its industrial gases business on a geographic basis, while the Engineering and Other businesses are generally managed on a global basis. Furthermore, the company believes that reporting sales by distribution method by reportable geographic segment best illustrates the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for its revenues, including terms and pricing.\nThe following tables show sales by distribution method at the consolidated level and for each reportable segment and Other for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the results of both Praxair and Linde AG for the entire year. The year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the results of Praxair for the entire year and the results of Linde AG for the period beginning after October 31, 2018 (the merger date),\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs described above, Linde's contracts with on-site customers are under long-term supply arrangements which generally require the customer to purchase their requirements from Linde and also have minimum purchase requirements. The company estimates the consideration related to minimum purchase requirements is approximately $48 billion. This amount excludes all sales above minimum purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. In the future, actual amounts will be different due to impacts from several factors, many of which are beyond the company\u2019s control including, but not limited to, timing of newly signed, terminated and renewed contracts, inflationary price escalations, currency exchange rates, and pass-through costs related to natural gas and electricity. The actual duration of long-term supply contracts ranges up to twenty years. The company estimates that approximately half of the revenue related to minimum purchase requirements will be earned in the next five years and the remaining thereafter.\nNOTE 22. QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n*\nDue to quarterly changes in the share count as a result of the merger the sum of the four quarters does not equal the earnings per share amount calculated for the year.\n(a)\n2019 and 2018 include the impact of the following matters (see Notes 3, 4, 5, 7, 13 and 18):",
